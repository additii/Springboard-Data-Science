        "text": "\u00b61 This case asks us to reconsider whether it violates due process to assign a defendant the burden of proving consent as a defense to a charge of rape by forcible compulsion. We held in State v. Camara, 113 Wn.2d 631, 639-40, 781 P.2d 483 (1989), and reaffirmed in State v. Gregory, 158 Wn.2d 759, 801-04, 147 P.3d 1201 (2006), that notwithstanding the \u201cconceptual overlap\u201d between consent and forcible compulsion, the defendant may be tasked with proving consent by a preponderance of the evidence. Recently, we were asked to consider this issue a third time but we declined to reach it, instead resolving the case on Sixth Amendment grounds. State v. Lynch, 178 Wn.2d 487, 309 P.3d 482 (2013); U.S. Const. amend. VI. Three justices would have reached the issue and overruled Camara and Gregory. Lynch, 178 Wn.2d at 518 (Gordon McCloud, J., concurring). Today, we embrace that approach and reject the due process precedent set in Camara and Gregory as both incorrect and harmful. We reverse W.R.\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.\nStephens, J.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nf 2 Following a bench trial, the juvenile court found W.R. committed rape in the second degree under RCW 9A. 44-.050(l)(a). The event in question was a sexual encounter between W.R. and J.F. that occurred on January 2, 2011, while J.F. was visiting her aunt, who resided with W.R. and his sister. Both W.R. and J.F. were minors at the time.\n\u00b63 Throughout the police investigation, W.R. consistently denied ever having sexual intercourse with J.F. Shortly before trial, he admitted that they had engaged in sexual intercourse on January 2, 2011, but defended it as consensual. Tr. of Adjudicatory Hr\u2019g (TAH) (June 16, 2011) at 155-62. To support his defense, W.R. testified that J.F. had a crush on him and that the two had engaged in sexual intercourse on a prior occasion in July 2010. Id. at 146. J.F. initially denied ever having sex with W.R. before the January incident. TAH (June 15, 2011 Morning Session) at 78-79. At trial, however, she admitted to having sex with W.R. on both occasions but insisted she did not consent to either. Id. at 81-84. Although W.R.\u2019s sister did not witness the alleged rape, she was in the vicinity when it occurred and testified that J.F. had a crush on W.R. TAH (June 16, 2011) at 72, 86-87.\n\u00b64 At the close of the bench trial, Judge Gregory P. Canova observed that \u201cthe key issue ... is credibility.\u201d TAH (June 21,2011) at 110. The court did not find W.R.\u2019s and his sister\u2019s testimony to be credible, noting W.R.\u2019s evasive responses to questions and inconsistent story, id. at 121-24, and his sister\u2019s uncorroborated story and cavalier demeanor at trial, id. at 111-16. The court found J.F.\u2019s testimony to be credible, id. at 116-21, and concluded W.R. committed rape in the second degree by forcible compulsion. The court explained that the State had proved rape in the second degree beyond a reasonable doubt and that W.R. had failed to prove the defense of consent by a preponderance of the evidence. Id. at 124; Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 50.\nf 5 W.R. appealed, arguing the juvenile court erred in allocating to him the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the act was consensual. W.R. conceded the allocation was consistent with our prior decisions in Camara and Gregory but argued these decisions were based on a flawed reading of United States Supreme Court precedent and violated his due process rights. Division One of the Court of Appeals affirmed in a brief, unpublished per curiam opinion, noting it was bound by our decisions in Camara and Gregory. State v. W.R., noted at 171 Wn. App. 1019 (2012). We granted review. State v. W.R., 179 Wn.2d 1001, 315 P.3d 531 (2013).\nISSUE\n\u00b66 When the State charges the defendant under a rape statute that includes \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d as a necessary element of the crime, does due process forbid requiring a criminal defendant to prove consent by a preponderance of the evidence?\nANALYSIS\n\u00b67 The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees, \u201cNo state shall. . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XTV, \u00a7 l. The United States Supreme Court has interpreted this due process guaranty as requiring the State to prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt . . . every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which [a defendant] is charged.\u201d In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970). A corollary rule is that the State cannot require the defendant to disprove any fact that constitutes the crime charged.\n\u00b68 Due process does not require the State to disprove every possible fact that would mitigate or excuse the defendant\u2019s culpability. Smith v. United States,_U.S. _, 133 S. Ct. 714, 184 L. Ed. 2d 570 (2013); Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 207, 97 S. Ct. 2319, 53 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1977). The legislature does not violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights when it allocates to the defendant the burden of proving an affirmative defense when the defense merely \u201c \u2018excuses [s] conduct that would otherwise be punishable.\u2019 \u201d Smith, 133 S. Ct. at 719 (alteration in original) (quoting Dixon v. United States, 548 U.S. 1, 6, 126 S. Ct. 2437, 165 L. Ed. 2d 299 (2006)); see also Martin v. Ohio, 480 U.S. 228, 107 S. Ct. 1098, 94 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1987). But when a defense necessarily negates an element of an offense, it is not a true affirmative defense and the legislature may not allocate to the defendant the burden of proving the defense. State v. Fry, 168 Wn.2d 1, 7, 228 P.3d 1 (2010) (explaining that \u201c[a]n affirmative defense admits the defendant committed a criminal act but pleads an excuse for doing so\u201d; it \u201cdoes not negate any elements of the charged crime\u201d); Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 699, 704, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975). In such a case, the legislature can require the defendant only to present sufficient evidence to create a reasonable doubt as to his or her guilt. State v. Riker, 123 Wn.2d 351, 367-68, 869 P.2d 43 (1994).\n\u00b69 W.R. contends the trial court violated his due process rights when it allocated to him the burden of proving consent, which he maintains negates the element of forcible compulsion. Suppl. Br. of Pet\u2019r at 4. We hold that consent negates the element of forcible compulsion. Therefore, once a defendant asserts a consent defense and provides sufficient evidence to support the defense, the State bears the burden of proving lack of consent as part of its proof of the element of forcible compulsion.\n1. Burdening a Defendant with Proving a Defense That Negates an Element of the Crime Charged Violates Due Process\n\u00b610 This court in Camara held that in rape prosecutions involving forcible compulsion, the \u201cconceptual overlap\u201d between the defense of consent and the element of forcible compulsion does not forbid imposing on the defendant the burden to prove consent by a preponderance of the evidence. 113 Wn.2d at 638-40. Unfortunately, we came to this conclusion without applying the \u201c \u2018negates\u2019 \u201d analysis. Id. at 639. When we decided Camara we were skeptical of the viability of this analysis following the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Martin. Id. at 640. We interpreted Martin to mean that requiring a defendant to prove a defense by a preponderance of the evidence is \u201cnot precluded by the fact that the defense \u2018negates\u2019 an element of a crime.\u201d Id.\nfll This reading o\u00ed Martin failed to appreciate that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in that case was limited. The Court held that due process does not forbid placing the burden of proving self-defense on the defendant charged with the crime of aggravated murder. 480 U.S. at 233. In so holding, the Court acknowledged that while self-defense \u201cmay negate\u201d the mens rea of \u201cpurposeful killing by prior calculation and design\u201d in \u201cmost encounters,\u201d it does not impermissibly shift the burden of proving a purposeful killing because self-defense merely excuses a killing that would otherwise constitute aggravated murder in Ohio. Id. at 234 (emphasis added). In other words, the Court found that a purposeful killing could coexist with self-defense, so the presence of self-defense does not necessarily negate a finding of purposeful killing.\n\u00b612 Smith subsequently clarified that the prosecution must always bear the burden of disproving a defense that necessarily negates an element of the charged offense. 133 S. Ct. at 719. The Court explained:\nThe State is foreclosed from shifting the burden of proof to the defendant only \u201cwhen an affirmative defense does negate an element of the crime.\u201d Where instead it \u201cexcuse [s] conduct that would otherwise be punishable,\u201d but \u201cdoes not controvert any of the elements of the offense itself\u201d the Government has no constitutional duty to overcome the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\nId. (alteration in original) (quoting Martin, 480 U.S. at 237 (Powell, J., dissenting); Dixon, 548 U.S. at 6). Read together, Martin and Smith hold that the State may burden a defendant with proving an affirmative defense that excuses otherwise criminal conduct even when the defense overlaps one of the elements under most circumstances, but the State may not burden a defendant with proving a defense that necessarily negates an element of the charged offense. Thus, the propriety of the negates analysis is no longer in doubt.\n\u00b613 Since Martin, we have applied the negates analysis to a variety of defenses. See, e.g., State v. Deer, 175 Wn.2d 725, 734, 287 P.3d 539 (2012) (lack of volition does not negate any element of third degree rape of a child); Riker, 123 Wn.2d at 368 (duress defense does not negate an element of delivery and possession of cocaine); State v. Box, 109 Wn.2d 320, 330, 745 P.2d 23 (1987) (insanity does not negate an element of first degree murder). In fact, we implicitly applied the negates analysis in Gregory, albeit incorrectly, to affirm Camara\u2019s holding. See Gregory, 158 Wn.2d at 803-04 (relying on Riker for proposition that consent does not negate an element of rape by forcible compulsion), 803 n.21 (explaining its holding was not inconsistent with the negates analysis applied in Dixon, 548 U.S. 1).\n\u00b614 We hold that when a defense necessarily negates an element of the crime, it violates due process to place the burden of proof on the defendant. The key to whether a defense necessarily negates an element is whether the completed crime and the defense can coexist.\n2. Consent Necessarily Negates the Element of \u201cForcible Compulsion\u201d\n\u00b615 Although the State agrees that the negates analysis remains at the center of the due process issue, it argues our decisions in Camara and Gregory were nevertheless correct because consent does not necessarily negate the element of forcible compulsion. If consent does not always negate forcible compulsion, it would not offend due process to require W.R. to prove consent by a preponderance of the evidence. The State acknowledges that \u201cconsent will \u2018often tend to negate\u2019 forcible compulsion\u201d but argues \u201cthe overlap is not complete.\u201d State\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 14, 16; see also Br. of Amicus Curiae Wash. Ass\u2019n of Prosecuting Att\u2019ys at 6. The proffered hypotheticals do not convince us.\n\u00b616 The statute defines \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d as \u201cphysical force which overcomes resistance, or a threat . . . that places a person in fear of death or physical injury to herself or himself or another person, or in fear that she or he or another person will be kidnapped.\u201d RCW 9A.44.010(6) (emphasis added). As defined, forcible compulsion contemplates force that overcomes actual resistance or threats that place a person in actual fear. There can be no forcible compulsion when the victim consents, as there is no resistance to overcome. Nor is there actual fear of death, physical injury, or kidnapping when the victim consents.\n\u00b617 Other courts have recognized that when a person consents to sexual intercourse, such consent negates foreible compulsion. Examining the crime of rape by forcible compulsion in Washington, the Ninth Circuit noted in dicta that \u201cconsent appears to negate the element of \u2018forcible compulsion\u2019 rather than provide an excuse (i.e., affirmative defense) for admitted illegal conduct\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe State\u2019s requirement-that [the defendant] demonstrate that consent did in fact exist-seems to violate his constitutional right to due process.\u201d Spicer v. Gregoire, 194 F.3d 1006, 1008 (9th Cir. 1999). Michigan courts have similarly found consent to negate the element of forcible compulsion in their rape laws, on which Washington relied heavily in drafting its rape laws. Lynch, 178 Wn.2d at 516-17 (Gordon McCloud, J., concurring) (quoting People v. Waltonen, 272 Mich. App. 678, 728 N.W.2d 881, 887 (2006)). In Michigan, the prosecution must disprove consent beyond a reasonable doubt wherever the defendant produces sufficient evidence to put the issue in controversy. See People v. Thompson, 117 Mich. App. 522, 324 N.W.2d 22, 24-25 (1982). This same rule must apply in Washington.\nfl8 Requiring a defendant to do more than raise a reasonable doubt is inconsistent with due process principles. As we explained in Riker, when a defense negates an element of the crime, the State can require the defendant to prove that defense only to the extent of creating a reasonable doubt as to his or her guilt. 123 Wn.2d at 367. Because the defense of consent necessarily negates the element of forcible compulsion, credible evidence of consent necessarily raises doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt. As such, the defense of consent should be treated similar to the alibi defense at issue in Riker in that the defendant need only produce sufficient evidence to create a reasonable doubt as to the victim\u2019s consent. The defendant cannot be burdened with proving consent by a preponderance of the evidence, as the burden must remain on the State to prove forcible compulsion beyond reasonable doubt. See Smith, 133 S. Ct. at 719.\n\u00b619 Recognizing that the State\u2019s burden to prove forcible compulsion encompasses the concept of nonconsent is consistent with rape reform laws. Laws of 1975, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 14. The dissent complains that our decision reverses the progress made in shifting the focus of rape prosecutions away from the victim\u2019s conduct and onto the defendant\u2019s. Dissent at 771-72. It does not. As Professor Loh explained in a leading law review article discussed in Camara, the new law \u201cfocuses more on the actor\u2019s use or threat of force rather than the victim\u2019s conduct as the external criterion of nonconsent.\u201d Wallace D. Loh, The Impact of Common Law and Reform Rape Statutes on Prosecution: An Empirical Study, 55 Wash. L. Rev. 543, 550 (1980); 113 Wn.2d at 637. Washington and \u201c[m]odern statutory and decisional law do not treat force and nonconsent as separate formal elements.\u201d Loh, supra, at 552 n.43. Rather, force is an objective indicator of nonconsent. Id.; see also Helen Glenn Tutt, Washington\u2019s Attempt To View Sexual Assault as More Than a \u201cViolation\u201d of the Moral Woman \u2014 The Revision of the Rape Laws, 11 Gonz. L. Rev. 145,156 (1975). The court in Camara rejected the argument that rape law reforms \u201celiminated consent as an issue in rape prosecutions.\u201d 113 Wn.2d at 637 n.3. While the State agrees, the dissent insists that rape law reformers removed the element of nonconsent from the forcible rape statutes. Dissent at 772-73. But, as the court in Camara explained, the shift in focus to \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d was \u201cmore a refinement than a reformulation.\u201d 113 Wn.2d at 637 n.3. It remains that a person is not guilty of rape if the sexual intercourse is consensual. 11 Washington Practice: Washington Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal 18.25, at 288-89 (3d ed. 2008).\n\u00b620 We hold that consent necessarily negates forcible compulsion. For this reason, due process prohibits shifting the burden to the defendant to prove consent by a preponderance of the evidence. While the defendant may be tasked with producing evidence to put consent in issue, such evidence need only create reasonable doubt as to the victim\u2019s consent. Our prior decisions in Camara and Gregory are inconsistent with this holding; we thus must explain why these cases must be overruled.\n3. Gregory and Camara Are Incorrect and Harmful\n\u00b621 The principle of stare decisis is vital to protecting the rights of litigants and the integrity of the common law. Lunsford v. Saberhagen Holdings, Inc., 166 Wn.2d 264, 278, 208 P.3d 1092 (2009). We will overrule a prior decision only upon a clear showing that the rule it announced is incorrect and harmful. State v. Barber, 170 Wn.2d 854, 863-65, 248 P.3d 494 (2011) (explaining standard for overruling precedent). A rule can become incorrect when subsequent United States Supreme Court precedent clarifies that our prior understanding was erroneous. State v. Abdulle, 174 Wn.2d 411, 420, 275 P.3d 1113 (2012).\n\u00b622 As our analysis above makes clear, Camara and Gregory are incorrect. They misapprehend United States Supreme Court precedent and misdescribe the relationship between forcible compulsion and nonconsent. In Camara we concluded that consent is the \u201cconceptual opposite\u201d of forcible compulsion. 113 Wn.2d at 637. Gregory further held that this merely means there is \u201cconceptual overlap between the consent defense and the forcible compulsion element,\u201d 158 Wn.2d at 803; see also Camara, 113 Wn.2d at 640. But neither case explains how two things can be conceptual opposites without negating one another. This conclusion is untenable because no circumstance could exist where a defendant forcibly compels a victim to engage in consensual sexual intercourse.\n\u00b623 Gregory\u2019s faulty reasoning circuitously relied on our decision in Riker. 158 Wn.2d at 803 (citing the fact that \u201cthe Riker court included the consent defense to rape in its list of defenses that did not negate an element of the crime\u201d as the only evidence for its conclusion that consent does not negate forcible compulsion (emphasis added)). Riker simply summarized the holding of Camara; it did not independently analyze whether consent negated or overlapped with forcible compulsion. 123 Wn.2d at 366. The Camara court did not explain why consent does not negate forcible compulsion even though it considered them to be \u201cconceptual opposite[s].\u201d 113 Wn.2d at 637. Thus, neither Camara, Riker, nor Gregory provides us with any defensible argument for the conclusion that consent does not negate forcible compulsion.\nf 24 Camara and Gregory are also harmful. In violation of a defendant\u2019s due process right to have the State prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, the rule in these cases impermissibly shifts the burden to the defendant to negate forcible compulsion by establishing consent. This impermissible shift in burden is not merely academic but risks compartmentalizing forcible compulsion and consent, raising a very real possibility of wrongful convictions. We have found sufficient justification to overrule prior decisions with arguably less harm. State v. Devin, 158 Wn.2d 157, 167-68, 142 P.3d 599 (2006) (overruling State v. Furth, 82 Wash. 665, 667, 144 P. 907 (1914) because of collateral consequences including depriving crime victims of compensation, causing emotional distress, and impacting family court proceedings); Abdulle, 174 Wn.2d at 420 (overruling State v. Davis, 73 Wn.2d 271, 438 P.2d 185 (1968) because it kept relevant evidence from the trier of fact). The due process violation created by the rule in Camara and Gregory is plainly harmful.\nf 25 We overrule Camara and Gregory to the extent they hold that consent does not negate forcible compulsion and that a defendant can be required to prove consent by a preponderance of the evidence.\n4. The Remedy Is Remand for a New Trial\n\u00b626 Placing the burden on W.R. to prove consent by a preponderance of the evidence violated his due process rights. Where a constitutional error occurs, reversal is ordinarily the proper remedy unless the State can prove the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Guloy, 104 Wn.2d 412, 425, 705 P.2d 1182 (1985). We do not find that the State can satisfy that burden here.\n127 The State argues that the trial judge\u2019s credibility determinations formed the basis of his decision and that an \u201cafter-the-fact inclusion of the burden of proof [for] consent could not have affected this decision.\u201d State\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 19. \u201c[I]t is the function of the trial court and not [the appellate] court to consider the credibility of witnesses and to weigh the evidence.\u201d Nissen v. Obde, 55 Wn.2d 527, 529, 348 P.2d 421 (1960). But, we cannot overlook the fact that the trial judge, in making his credibility determinations, acted within the incorrect framework.\n\u00b628 The defense and prosecution both relied on an incorrect understanding of the law when they fashioned and presented their arguments surrounding consent. Creating a reasonable doubt for the defense is far easier than proving the defense by a preponderance of the evidence. And the trial court\u2019s express conclusion was that W.R. did not prove consent. CP at 50. The record does not show any consideration of the interplay between consent and forcible compulsion under the negates analysis, making it impossible for us to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable fact finder would not have been swayed by arguments made using the correct burden of proof. Id.\n\u00b629 We therefore must remand for a new trial with the proper burden allocations.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b630 When a defense necessarily negates an element of the crime charged, the State may not shift the burden of proving that defense onto the defendant. To hold otherwise unconstitutionally relieves the State of its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. We hold consent necessarily negates forcible compulsion. We overrule Camara and Gregory to the extent they hold the defendant bears the burden of proving consent by a preponderance of the evidence. We remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion.\nMadsen, C.J.; Fairhurst, Wiggins, and Gordon McCloud, JJ.; and Kulik, J. Pro Tem., concur.\nOur state constitution similarly guarantees, \u201cNo person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d Const, art. I, \u00a7 3. W.R. has not argued that Camara and Gregory violate our state constitution.\nIn Gregory, we dismissed Spicer as dicta. 158 Wn.2d at 804 n.22. While the court was correct that the decision in Spicer ultimately avoided the constitutional question, the Ninth Circuit expressly disagreed with Camara.\nBecause the focus is on forcible compulsion, jury instructions need only require the State to prove the elements of the crime. It is not necessary to add a new instruction on consent simply because evidence of consent is produced.",

        "text": "\u00b631 (dissenting) \u2014 Prior to 1975, rape was defined as sex \u201ccommitted against the person\u2019s will and without the person\u2019s consent.\u201d Former RCW 9.79.010 (Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 154, \u00a7 122), repealed by Laws of 1975, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 14, \u00a7 10. Thus, prior to 1975, the State bore the burden of proving that a rape victim had not consented. State v. Camara, 113 Wn.2d 631, 636, 781 P.2d 483 (1989). Under the prior statute, trials focused on the victim\u2019s behavior, putting the victim\u2019s credibility, reputation, and conduct on trial. As a consequence, many victims chose silence over the trauma of a trial that focused on their actions and character. In short, our rape laws \u201creflect [ed] male-oriented interests\u201d and resulted in \u201clow rates of reporting, arrest, prosecution, and conviction.\u201d Wallace D. Loh, The Impact of Common Law and Reform Rape Statutes on Prosecution: An Empirical Study, 55 Wash. L. Rev. 543, 570 (1980). In 1975, the legislature wisely chose to revise the law, removing the lack of consent element and instead requiring the State to prove forcible compulsion on the part of the perpetrator \u2014 switching the focus to the perpetrator's actions. RCW 9A.44.040G), ,050(l)(a); Camara, 113 Wn.2d at 636.\nOwens, J.\n\u00b632 Today, the majority reverses that progress. The majority departs from recent and well-reasoned precedent, retreating to the archaic focus on a rape victim\u2019s actions instead of those of the perpetrator. Placing the burden on the State to disprove consent wrongfully puts the victim\u2019s actions and reputation on trial. Not only does the majority\u2019s decision invalidate years of work undertaken to properly refocus our rape law, but it also has serious implications for victims of an already underreported type of crime. I respectfully dissent.\n\u00b633 I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to cast aside our recent precedent. We have analyzed the burden of proof for consent in rape cases twice in the past 25 years. State v. Gregory, 158 Wn.2d 759, 801-04, 147 P.3d 1201 (2006); Camara, 113 Wn.2d at 637-40. Both times, we concluded that under the current rape laws, the State has the burden of proving forcible compulsion and that consent is an affirmative defense that can be raised and proved by the defendant. Gregory, 158 Wn.2d at 801-04; Camara, 113 Wn.2d at 637-40.1 disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to discard this recently confirmed precedent, particularly in light of the decision\u2019s real-world consequences for rape victims seeking justice. The majority overlooks the harm that its holding will cause to the victims of rape, who will now face a trial centered around their conduct.\n\u00b634 As we recognized in Gregory and Camara, the plain language of the first and second degree rape statutes makes it clear that the legislature decided against requiring the State to prove lack of consent. When interpreting the plain meaning of a statute, we consider related provisions of the statute. Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 11-12, 43 P.3d 4 (2002). For first and second degree rape, the statutes make no mention of lack of consent. RCW 9A.44.040(1), .050(l)(a). Instead, first and second degree rape are both defined as sexual intercourse \u201cby forcible compulsion.\u201d RCW 9A.44.040(1), .050(l)(a). In contrast, the third degree rape statute explicitly requires proof of lack of consent. RCW 9A.44.060(l)(a). Thus, the plain language of the statute indicates that to obtain a conviction for first or second degree rape, the legislature intended that the State prove forcible compulsion beyond a reasonable doubt rather than lack of consent.\n\u00b635 The legislature thoughtfully and intentionally made the decision to require the State to prove forcible compulsion rather than lack of consent. As we have previously concluded, the legislature intended to place the burden on the State to prove forcible compulsion \u2014 rather than lack of consent \u2014 and therefore remove the focus from the victim\u2019s conduct. Camara, 113 Wn.2d at 638-39. The revised law thus \u201c 'announce[d] society\u2019s interest in accurately identifying perpetrators of rape, not in reinforcing traditional assumptions regarding appropriate behavior of [virtuous] [men and] women.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 639 (second and third alterations in original) (quoting Loh, supra, at 557). By placing the burden on the State to prove lack of consent \u2014 despite the legislature\u2019s decision to the contrary \u2014 the majority\u2019s decision will shift the focus back to the actions of the victim.\n\u00b636 This shift in focus has troubling implications. As noted above, the former, victimcentric statutes resulted in \u201clow rates of reporting, arrest, prosecution, and conviction.\u201d Loh, supra, at 570. If victims believe that the trial will focus on their behavior rather than the perpetrator\u2019s actions, they will be less likely to report the rape. If they do report the rape, they may feel that they themselves are on trial when the focus shifts to their actions rather than the crime against them. I agree with the concerns expressed by amici curiae that the majority\u2019s decision may \u201copen the door for defendants to emphasize rape myths and victim-blaming,\u201d making it even more difficult for sexual assault victims to receive justice. Br. of Amici Curiae Wash. Coal, of Sexual Assault Programs, King County Sexual Assault Res. Ctr., Legal Voice, and Sexual Violence Law Ctr. at 2. Given these unjust societal consequences, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s decision.\n\u00b637 In 1975, the legislature took an important step toward justice for rape victims when it modified the laws to focus on the conduct of the perpetrator and not the victim. Unfortunately, today\u2019s decision by the majority reverses that progress. I respectfully dissent.\nC.

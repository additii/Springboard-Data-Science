        "text": "Madsen, C.J.\n\u00b61 This case concerns whether a debtor who has filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition may maintain a derivative action on behalf of a limited liability company (LLC), of which the debtor was a former member. The primary inquiry addresses the interplay of federal bankruptcy law and portions of the Washington Limited Liability Company Act (WALLCA), ch. 25.15 RCW, and whether the state provisions are superseded under the circumstances of this case; specifically, whether 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 541 or 365 preempt RCW 25.15.130(l)(d). We hold that the dissociation provision found in RCW 25.15.130(l)(d) is not preempted by federal bankruptcy law and affirm the dismissal of the former LLC member\u2019s derivative claim under the facts of this case.\nFACTS\n\u00b62 Washington orchardists Harold and Shirley Ostenson (collectively Ostenson) and California organic fruit broker Greg Holzman (d/b/a Greg Holzman Inc. (GHI)) formed Pac Organic Fruit LLC (Pac-O) in 1998. GHI held the majority interest and management responsibilities under the LLC\u2019s operating agreement. Ostenson was required to rent his local Washington storage and packing facility to Pac-O, to run that facility, and to obtain and pay a loan to improve that facility. The business operated from 1998 through 2004 but collapsed in 2005. During 2005, Pac-O defaulted on its operating line of credit and lease payments, Holzman fired Ostenson, and the bank foreclosed on the packing facility. Thereafter, Holzman, acting as Pac-O\u2019s agent, executed a demand promissory note in favor of GHI and transferred Pac-O\u2019s assets to GHI to satisfy the note.\n\u00b63 On January 9, 2007, Ostenson filed a voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. In May 2007, a creditor of Pac-O, Northwest Wholesale Inc., filed the present suit against Pac-O, Ostenson, and GHI, alleging fraudulent conveyance from Pac-O to GHI. In response, Ostenson filed cross claims and/or third party claims against Pac-O, Holzman, GHI, and Total Organic LLC (another Holzman company). Ostenson\u2019s claims against Holzman and his companies (collectively Holzman defendants or HDs) were as a derivative action on behalf of Pac-O.\n\u00b64 On January 24,2011, the trial court dismissed Northwest Wholesale\u2019s claims following settlement of same. Thereafter, the only remaining claims were Ostenson\u2019s responsive claims against Pac-O (seven counts) and his derivative claim (count VIII) against HDs. Trial commenced on July 11, 2011. On July 13, after Ostenson rested, HDs moved to dismiss count VIII under CR 41(b)(3). HDs argued that under the WALLCA, (1) a plaintiff asserting a derivative action must be a member of the LLC (see RCW 25.15.130(1)(d), .370, .375), (2) when Ostenson filed his bankruptcy petition, he was dissociated as a member of the LLC (and thus had only the rights of an assignee, i.e., right to share in profits, but no management rights) (see RCW 25.15.130(1)(d)(ii), .250(1)-(2)), and (3) as Ostenson had been dissociated from membership in Pac-0 by filing bankruptcy, he lacked authority (standing) to bring a derivative action on behalf of Pac-O. Ostenson answered the motion, arguing that HDs had consented to the derivative action via a stipulation that was previously entered in Ostenson\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding.\n\u00b65 The trial court took the matter under advisement and directed HDs to go forward and present their evidence. HDs presented witnesses over the remainder of that day (July 13) and the next day but did not finish their testimony. The trial court then continued the matter several times. Finally on September 7, 2012, following additional briefing, the trial court granted HDs\u2019 CR 41 motion. In its October 3, 2012 written findings and conclusions, the trial court (1) rejected Ostenson\u2019s contention that HDs had waived their CR 41 motion by putting on evidence, (2) rejected Osten-son\u2019s contention that HDs had consented to the derivative action in the stipulation in Ostenson\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding, and (3) ruled that Ostenson relinquished membership in Pac-0 with his bankruptcy filing.\n\u00b66 On October 15, 2012, Ostenson filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing for the first time that federal bankruptcy law preempts WALLCA regarding dissociation of LLC members upon filing bankruptcy. The trial court denied Ostenson\u2019s motion for reconsideration on January 23, 2013. Ostenson appealed, and Division Three affirmed, holding that HDs did not waive their CR 41 motion to dismiss, HDs did not consent to Ostenson bringing a derivative action, and federal bankruptcy law governing bankruptcy estates and executory contracts did not preempt WALLCA\u2019s dissociation statute. Nw. Wholesale, Inc. v. Pac Organic Fruit, LLC, 183 Wn. App. 459, 474-89, 334 P.3d 63 (2014), review granted, 182 Wn.2d 1009, 343 P.3d 759 (2015). Ostenson sought and was granted review in this court on only two issues: waiver and preemption.\nANALYSIS\nWaiver\n\u00b67 Ostenson argues that HDs waived his right to seek dismissal of his derivative claim, based on Ostenson\u2019s lack of standing, by presenting defense evidence after the court took HDs\u2019 CR 41 motion to dismiss under advisement. Ostenson contends that the trial court\u2019s granting HDs\u2019 motion and the Court of Appeals affirmance of same are at odds with Hector v. Martin, 51 Wn.2d 707, 321 P.2d 555 (1958). That is incorrect. Hector stands for the proposition that a defendant waives the right to challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence alone by presenting evidence in defense, thereby allowing the court to consider the motion in light of all of the evidence. Id. at 709-10 (\u201c[T]he failure of the trial court to rule on such motion before introduction of proof by a defendant, is tantamount to a denial of the motion. . . . Therefore, this case must be viewed in the light of all the evidence.\u201d)- Here, the question in the motion to dismiss did not turn on the sufficiency of the evidence; the salient facts, the dates of Ostenson\u2019s bankruptcy filing and the subsequent filing of his derivative claim, were not in dispute. The motion turned on a legal question\u2014Ostenson\u2019s standing to bring the derivative claim in light of ROW 25.15.130(1)(d) (discussed below). And even if sufficiency of the evidence bore on any pertinent question, nothing indicates that the trial court limited itself to considering only Ostenson\u2019s evidence.\n\u00b68 Further, Hector does not address the circumstance here, where the trial court directed HDs to \u201cgo forward\u201d and put on their evidence. 3 Verbatim Report of Proceedings at 603. Under these circumstances, HDs did not waive their CR 41 motion as Ostenson contends. The trial court did not err in granting the motion to dismiss under these circumstances.\nPreemption\n\u00b69 Ostenson repeats the argument he made below that \u201c[b]oth 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(c)(1) and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(e)(1) invalidate or render unenforceable ipso facto bankruptcy clauses.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. at 28; Pet. for Review at 12. We begin by noting the strong presumption against preemption. While the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution provides that United States law is supreme, notwithstanding any contrary state law, see Hue v. Farmboy Spray Co., 127 Wn.2d 67, 78, 896 P.2d 682 (1995) (citing U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2), \u201cany consideration of preemption issues \u2018start [s] with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by . . . Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 \u201d Id. (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Cipollone v. Liggett Grp., Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516, 112 S. Ct. 2608, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1992)). Accordingly, this court applies \u201ca \u2018strong presumption against finding preemption [of State law] in an ambiguous case. . . . State laws are not superseded by federal law unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 \u201d Id. (alterations in original) (quoting Progressive Animal Welfare Soc\u2019y v. Univ. of Wash., 125 Wn.2d 243, 265, 884 P.2d 592 (1994) (plurality opinion)). Even if there is an express preemption clause, this court will give it \u201ca \u2018fair but narrow reading.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 79 (quoting Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 524). With this presumption in mind, we turn to the statutes at issue.\nState Law (WALLCA) Provisions\n\u00b610 RCW 25.15.375 provides:\nIn a derivative action, the plaintiff must be a member at the time of bringing the action and:\n(1) At the time of the transaction of which the plaintiff complains; or\n(2) The plaintiff\u2019s status as a member had devolved upon him or her by operation of law or pursuant to the terms of a limited liability company agreement from a person who was a member at the time of the transaction.\n(Emphasis added.) Under RCW 25.15.130(l)(d)(ii), a member of an LLC loses his or her membership upon the filing of bankruptcy. The statute provides:\n(1) A person ceases to be a member of a limited liability company, and the person or its successor in interest attains the status of an assignee as set forth in RCW 25.15.250(2), upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events:\n(d) Unless otherwise provided in the limited liability company agreement, or with the written consent of all other members at the time, the member . . . (ii) files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\u00b611 Thus, under Washington law, Ostenson forfeited any right to bring a derivative action on behalf of Pac-0 when he petitioned for bankruptcy. The LLC agreement did not allow continued membership but conversely ended the bankruptcy petitioner\u2019s membership in the LLC. As an assignee, the dissociated member retains rights to share in profits but loses any management rights. RCW 25.15-.250(2). Ostenson argues only that the dissolution provision of RCW 25.15.130(1)(d) is preempted by federal bankruptcy law; to this court he does not otherwise challenge the provisions or effect of the WALLCA.\nFederal Bankruptcy Law Provisions\n\u00b612 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541 provides in part:\n(a) The commencement of a case under ... this title creates an estate. Such estate is comprised of all the following property, wherever located and by whomever held:\n(1) Except as provided in subsections (b)[] and (c)(2) of this section, all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\n(Emphasis added.) Section 541(c)(1) provides:\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an interest of the debtor in property becomes property of the estate under subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(5) of this section notwithstanding any provision in an agreement, transfer instrument, or applicable nonbankruptcy law\u2014\n(A) that restricts or conditions transfer of such interest by the debtor; or\n(B) that is conditioned on the insolvency or financial condition of the debtor, on the commencement of a case under this title, or on the appointment of or taking possession by a trustee in a case under this title or a custodian before such commencement, and that effects or gives an option to effect a forfeiture, modification, or termination of the debtor\u2019s interest in property.\n(Emphasis added.)\nState Law Determines Property Interest\n\u00b613 As can be seen, a bankruptcy filing triggers the creation of a bankruptcy estate into which the debtor\u2019s property interest devolves. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a). The threshold question, however, of how a debtor\u2019s interest is determined turns on application of state law. See, e.g., Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55, 99 S. Ct. 914, 59 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1979) (\u201cProperty interests are created and defined by state law.\u201d). As the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals explained in In re Pettit, 217 F.3d 1072, 1078 (9th Cir. 2000):\nAlthough the question whether an interest claimed by the debtor is \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d is a federal question to be decided by federal law, bankruptcy courts must look to state law to determine whether and to what extent the debtor has any legal or equitable interests in property as of the commencement of the case.\nSee also Fisher v. Apostolou, 155 F.3d 876, 880 (7th Cir. 1998) (\u201cThe nature of a debtor\u2019s interest in property is determined by state law, but the question whether the resulting interest should count as \u2018property of the estate\u2019 for \u00a7 541 purposes is an issue of federal law.\u201d (citation omitted)).\n\u00b614 In re Farmers Markets, Inc., 792 F.2d 1400 (9th Cir. 1986), is instructive. Therein, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a bankruptcy court\u2019s decision that the debtor\u2019s estate would receive liquor licenses unhindered by transfer restrictions imposed by a state statute. Id. at 1401-02. In so holding, the court addressed the limits of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541 and how that provision is to be applied. Noting that the bankruptcy court\u2019s decisions rested on the misinterpretation of \u00a7 541, the court opined:\n[T]he [bankruptcy] court read \u00a7 541(a)(1) to broaden the definition of the property of the debtor\u2019s estate. Regardless of \u00a7 541(a)\u2019s scope, reliance upon it is misplaced. That provision merely defines what interests of the debtor are transferred to the estate. It does not address the threshold questions of the existence and scope of the debtor\u2019s interest in a given asset. Under [federal bankruptcy law], we resolve these questions by reference to nonbankruptcy law. Section 541(a)(1) was thus irrelevant to the inquiry.\nId. at 1402 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). The court made clear that the \u201c \u2018bankrupt estate, insofar as it includes liquor licenses, has only the limited value of the licenses encumbered as they may be by the terms of the statutes which create the licenses and provide the conditions of their transfer.\u2019 \u201dId. at 1403 (quoting In re Prof\u2019l Bar Co., 537 F.2d 339, 340 (9th Cir. 1976)). The court held, \u201cBecause the estate may take no greater interest than that held by the debtor, the estate takes the license subject to the restrictions imposed [by state statute] on the debtor by its transferor.\u201d Id. (citation omitted); see also In re S. Side House, LLC, 474 B.R. 391, 402 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2012) (\u201c \u2018[T]he estate succeeds to no more interest than the debtor had, and the estate takes its interest subject to the conditions under which the debtor held the interest.\u2019 \u201d (quoting In re Depoy, 29 B.R. 466, 469 (Bankr. N.D. Ind. 1983))).\n\u00b615 Farmers also explained that the bankruptcy court had misapplied \u00a7 541(c)(1)(A):\n[The bankruptcy court] read this provision to invalidate upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings all transfer restrictions on property in which the debtor holds an interest. Section 541(c)(1)(A), however, avoids only those restrictions which prevent transfer of the debtor\u2019s property to the estate.... [B]y its terms \u00a7 541(c)(1)(A) applies only to \u201cinterest[s] of the debtor in property.\u201d . . . Because [the state statute] placed no restrictions on the transfer of their entire interests to their respective estates, it does not conflict with \u00a7 541(c)(1)(A).\n792 F.2d at 1402 (emphasis added) (fourth alteration in original). Applying Farmers to Ostenson\u2019s case, his debt- or\u2019s bankruptcy estate took his interest as defined, determined, and encumbered according to state law. In other words, Ostenson\u2019s interest that devolved to his bankruptcy estate as determined by the above Washington statutes was his interest as an assignee and not as a member of the Pac-O LLC.\n\u00b616 The Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion applying In re Garrison-Ashburn, LC, 253 B.R. 700, 707 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2000), which applied a Virginia state law provision comparable to the above noted Washington statutes dissociating an LLC member upon the member\u2019s filing a bankruptcy petition. In Garrison-Ashburn, an LLC member filed for bankruptcy and then sought to execute a real estate contract on behalf of the LLC. Id. at 704. The other members of the LLC disputed the debtor\u2019s right to bind the LLC because under Virginia law, a member is dissociated upon filing for bankruptcy. Id. at 707. The debtor retained his economic interest\u2014to share in the profits and losses of the LLC\u2014but could no longer participate in management. Id. The Garrison-Ashburn court held that \u00a7 541(c) did not change this analysis:\nThis result does not offend the Congressional intention behind Sections 541(c) and 365(c) and (e). These provisions were intended to expand the bankruptcy estate to the maximum feasible extent and to prevent the loss of valuable assets by the operation of ipso facto clauses that terminate valuable leases and other rights upon bankruptcy. Here the estate received the entire interest of the debtor in [the LLC] including its burdens and restrictions. The economic interest, that is the membership interest, remains in the estate and is available for the benefit of creditors. The enforcement of [debtor\u2019s] statutory dissociation does not cause a forfeiture of those rights or impair the legal capacity of the company to continue in business.\nId. at 709. Garrison-Ashburn reconciled the application of both state law and the federal bankruptcy code by recognizing and applying the rule that state law defines the debtor\u2019s interest, including dissociation, then \u00a7 541 brings that interest into the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy estate, burdened by whatever state law requires.\n\u00b617 Ostenson cites to cases that have reached a result different than Garrison-Ashburn, but those cases either do not acknowledge or fail to apply Butner, or are otherwise distinguishable or not persuasive. For instance, In re First Protection, Inc., 440 B.R. 821, 830 (B.A.R 9th Cir. 2010), held that under \u00a7 541(a) all of the debtor\u2019s rights devolved to the estate and into the hands of the trustee, including the right to manage and control the LLC. Id. at 830. On the one hand, such holding arguably made practical sense in that the decision addressed a single-member LLC and, thus, there were no other members to manage the LLC if the trustee could not do so, nor were there any other nondebtor members\u2019 interests to be considered and protected. However, the court\u2019s application of \u00a7 541(a) is troubling. The court acknowledged the Butner rule\u2014that a debtor\u2019s interest is determined by state law\u2014but failed to apply that rule. The court acknowledged that a state statute specifically defined an LLC member\u2019s interest as \u201c \u2018a member\u2019s share of the profits and losses\u2019 \u201d of the LLC and \u201c \u2018the right to receive distributions of [LLC] assets.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 828-29 (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 29-601(13)). Nevertheless, the court applied \u00a7 541(a)\u2019s language, \u201call legal or equitable interest\u201d in the bankruptcy estate, broadly to include not just the interest as above defined by state law but also to include management rights. Such expansive use of \u00a7 541(a) to define a debtor\u2019s interest is contrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis in Farmers. See Farmers, 792 F.2d at 1402 (holding that \u00a7 541(a) addresses only the transfer of debt- or\u2019s interest to the estate and is \u201cirrelevant\u201d as to the threshold determination of the existence and scope of the debtor\u2019s interest). As this portion of the First Protection decision does not adhere to Butner, does not follow Ninth Circuit precedent, and is contrary to the presumption against preemption that this court applies, see Hue, 127 Wn.2d at 78, we do not find this portion of First Protection persuasive.\n\u00b618 Ostenson cites In re Yonikus, 996 F.2d 866, 869 (7th Cir. 1993), abrogated on other grounds by Law v. Siegel,_ U.S._, 134 S. Ct. 1188, 188 L. Ed. 2d 146 (2014), for the proposition that \u00a7 541(a)(1)\u2019s establishment of a bankruptcy estate sweeps broadly to include every conceivable interest of the debtor \u201cfuture, nonpossessory, contingent, speculative, and derivative.\u201d But all examples given therein concern money. See id. The availability to the estate of all of the debtor\u2019s economic interest is not at issue in this case. Ostenson\u2019s interest as an assignee devolved to the estate. Further, Yonikus acknowledges Butner for the proposition that determination of a debtor\u2019s interest in property is decided by state law. See id. (stating \u201c[t]he question whether an interest claimed by the debtor is \u2018property of the estate\u2019 is a federal question to be decided by federal law; however, courts must look to state law to determine whether and to what extent the debtor has any legal or equitable interests in property as of the commencement of the case\u201d)- Yonikus does not assist Ostenson.\n\u00b619 Ostenson also relies on In re Daugherty Construction, Inc., 188 B.R. 607 (Bankr. D. Neb. 1995), and In re Warner, 480 B.R. 641 (Bankr. N.D. W. Va. 2012), in which the respective bankruptcy courts held that \u00a7 541(c)(1) invalidated state statutory and contractual dissolution provisions. In those cases, the debtor\u2019s filing bankruptcy resulted in the dissolution of the LLC and the termination of all the debtor\u2019s interest therein. See Daugherty, 188 B.R. at 609-11 (statutory dissolution upon bankruptcy filing); Warner, 480 B.R. at 655-56 (bankruptcy triggering dissolution, liquidation, and distribution of proceeds per operating agreement). Thus, dissolution of the LLC under the state statute or operating agreement in these cases would result in depriving the estate of all of the debtor\u2019s interest. That is not the situation here. As explained above, Ostenson\u2019s bankruptcy estate took his interest, as determined and encumbered by Washington statutes, as an assignee. By doing so, his economic interest is preserved in his bankruptcy estate and \u201cis available for the benefit of creditors.\u201d Garrison-Ashburn, 253 B.R. at 709.\n\u00b620 In sum, we find that the Court of Appeals properly followed Garrison-Ashburn, federal bankruptcy code, and Washington law.\n11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n\u00b621 Ostenson contends that \u201c11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(e)(1) [as well as 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(c)(1)] invalidate or render unenforceable ipso facto bankruptcy clauses.\u201d Pet. for Review at 12. The relevant statute, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365, provides in relevant part:\n(e)(1) Notwithstanding a provision in an executory contract or unexpired lease, or in applicable law, an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor may not be terminated or modified, and any right or obligation under such contract or lease may not be terminated or modified, at any time after the commencement of the case solely because of a provision in such contract or lease that is conditioned on\u2014\n(B) the commencement of a case under this title . . .\n(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not apply to an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor, whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of duties, if\u2014\n(A)(i) applicable law excuses a party, other than the debtor, to such contract or lease from accepting performance from or rendering performance to the trustee or to an assignee of such contract or lease, whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of duties; and\n(ii) such paHy does not consent to such assumption or assignment.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\u00b622 Section 365 applies to executory contracts. As First Protection explains, \u201cGenerally, the bankruptcy estate automatically succeeds to a debtor\u2019s assets. However, because an executory contract is both a potential asset and a potential liability of the debtor it is treated differently.\u201d 440 B.R. at 830. Notably, \u201cif the operating agreement is an executory contract ... \u00a7 365 governs the trustee\u2019s rights rather than \u00a7 541(c)(1). In that event, the restrictive provisions under [a state] LLC Act or the operating agreement that affect the transfer of [d]ebtor\u2019s rights and interests in [an LLC] may be enforced through operation of \u00a7 365 [(e)(2)] in some instances.\u201d Id. at 830-31.\n\u00b623 Whether a contract is executory within the meaning of the bankruptcy code is a \u201cquestion of federal law.\u201d Id. at 831 (citing In re Alexander, 670 F.2d 885, 888 (9th Cir. 1982)). \u201cA contract is executory only when the \u2018obligations of both parties are so far unperformed that the failure of either party to complete performance would constitute a material breach and thus excuse the performance of the other.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting In re Ehmann, 319 B.R. 200, 204 (Bankr. D. Ariz. 2005)).\n\u00b624 Here, the Court of Appeals analyzed the obligations in the Pac-O operating agreement and noted that while they \u201cmay suffice to create an executory contract,\u201d the court ultimately \u201cneed not decide\u201d whether the Pac-O operating agreement is an executory contract because the court otherwise held that \u201c\u00a7 365(e) of the bankruptcy code excuses further performance under the agreement.\u201d Nw. Wholesale, 183 Wn. App. at 487-88; see In re Tsiaoushis, 383 B.R. 616, 620 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2007) (noting that the \u201cfinal step\u201d in any analysis of executory contracts under \u00a7 365 is the applicability of \u00a7 365(e)(2)\u2019s exemption from \u00a7 365(e)(1)\u2019s ipso facto prohibition). To address this issue, Division Three applied Finkelstein v. Security Properties, Inc., 76 Wn. App. 733, 888 P.2d 161 (1995). See Nw. Wholesale, 183 Wn. App. at 488.\n\u00b625 Ostenson asserts that Division Three\u2019s reliance on Finkelstein was error because that case addresses partnerships and not LLCs. Pet. for Review at 17. But Division Three\u2019s reliance on a partnership case was not improper. See Tsiaoushis, 383 B.R. at 618 (noting because LLCs are relatively new statutory creations, \u201cdecisions concerning partnership agreements are helpful\u201d). Accordingly, Division Three did not err in applying by analogy a partnership case that addressed application of \u00a7 365(e)(2).\n\u00b626 In Finkelstein, Division One held that a state law provision that dissolved a general partnership upon the filing of bankruptcy by any of the partners was not superseded by \u00a7 365(e)(l)\u2019s invalidation of ipso facto provisions. Therein, Finkelstein was a minority partner in two related general partnerships, each of which served as general partners for several limited partnerships. Finkelstein filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 and later converted to chapter 7. Before the bankruptcy filing, each general partnership agreement provided that the partnership would not dissolve or terminate upon the death, incapacity, or bankruptcy of any partner. After Finkelstein filed bankruptcy, each general partnership then amended its partnership agreement to exclude Finkelstein as a partner. Finkelstein then sued the general partnerships for an accounting and breach of fiduciary duties and brought a derivative action on behalf of several of the limited partnerships. The trial court dismissed Finkelstein\u2019s claims on statute of limitations grounds, and Division One affirmed, holding in part that state partnership law was not superseded by federal bankruptcy law, that the partnerships dissolved under state partnership law when Finkelstein\u2019s bankruptcy case was converted to chapter 7, and that as a former partner Finkelstein had no standing to bring breach of fiduciary duty claims or a derivative action on behalf of the limited partnerships. Finkelstein, 76 Wn. App. 733.\n\u00b627 Relevant here, noting that courts have \u201c \u2018generally assumed that partnership agreements are . . . executory contracts,\u2019 \u201d Division One held that \u201c[debtor\u2019s] bankruptcy trustee was not free to assume the contract under \u00a7 365 because the other partners were not obligated to accept such an assumption.\u201d Id. at 736-37 (quoting In re Cutler, 165 B.R. 275, 279-80 (Bankr. D. Ariz. 1994)). This is so because \u201c[partnerships are voluntary associations, and partners are not obligated to accept a substitution for their choice of partner.\u201d Id. at 737. The court additionally held that \u201c [t] he restraint on assumability also makes the deemed rejection provision of \u00a7 365 [(d)(1)] inapplicable to the partnership agreement. Therefore, \u00a7 365(e)\u2019s invalidation of ipso facto provisions does not apply, and state partnership law is not superseded.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). The Finkelstein court relied on a Fifth Circuit case, In re Phillips, 966 F.2d 926, 935 n.11 (1992), which noted that\ncourts which have ruled that \u00a7 365(e) supersedes state partnership law have failed to apply \u00a7 365(e)(2) to their analysis. Section 365(e) was designed to invalidate bankruptcy termination clauses (ipso facto provisions) in contracts. Section 365(e)(2) clarifies Congress\u2019 intention to prevent only private contracts from counteracting the bankruptcy code, not to prevent state law, such as partnership law, from determining the status of a partnership.\nFinkelstein, 76 Wn. App. at 737 n.3. Division One further explained, \u201cSection 365 is clearly not applicable to the executory portion of the partnership contract[, i.e., described as management rights and duties] because partnership agreements are purely consensual and the freedom of the partners to associate and dissociate is the heart of partnership law.\u201d Id. at 738. Accordingly, the Finkelstein court held that \u00a7 365 was not applicable and did not supersede state partnership law. Id.\nThe only duties owed to [debtor] after his removal from the partnership were the duties to account and pay to him (or his estate) the value of his share. [Debtor] ceased to be a member of the partnership upon dissolution, and has no rights against the remaining partners for their continuing business. It follows that he has no claims against the remaining partners for any alleged subsequent self-dealing. For the same reasons, we also affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of [debtor\u2019s] derivative action.\nId. at 740 (emphasis added).\n\u00b628 Here, the Court of Appeals sustainably relied on Finkelstein in holding that \u00a7 365 did not preempt Washington law that removed Ostenson as a member of Pac-O upon his bankruptcy filing. See Nw. Wholesale, 183 Wn. App. at 489. The same rights of voluntary association on which the Finkelstein decision turned apply equally to LLC membership. See Daugherty Constr., 188 B.R. at 611 (\u201cLike a partnership, members of the LLC have voluntarily associated in a business enterprise and the relationship among members may be personal in character.\u201d); see also Sally S. Neely, Partnerships and Partners and Limited Liability Companies and Members in Bankruptcy: Proposals for Reform, 71 Am. Bankr. L.J. 271, 312 (1997) (same); First Prot., 440 B.R. at 832 (plain language of \u00a7 365(c)(1) and \u00a7 365(e)(2)(A) makes clear that the provisions are not for the debtor\u2019s protection). \u201cThese sections [\u00a7 365(c)(1) and \u00a7 365(e)(2)(A)] were designed \u2018to protect non-debtor third parties whose rights may be prejudiced by having a contract performed by an entity other than the one with which they originally contracted.\u2019 \u201dFirst Prot., 440 B.R. at 832 (quoting In re C.W. Mining Co., 422 B.R. 746, 761 (B.A.P. 10th Cir. 2010)). The WALLCA clearly protects the voluntary association rights of nondebtor LLC members. For instance, while RCW 25.15.250 authorizes the assignability of a member\u2019s LLC interest \u201cin whole or in part,\u201d that statute nevertheless expressly protects the associational interests of the remaining members by providing:\nThe assignee of a member\u2019s limited liability company interest shall have no right to participate in the management of the business and. affairs of a limited liability company except\n. . . [u\\pon the approval of all of the members of the limited liability company other than the member assigning his or her limited liability company interest.\nRCW 25.15.250(1)(a) (emphasis added). Similarly, RCW 25.15.260, which addresses the right of an assignee to become a member, states in pertinent part, \u201cAn assignee of a limited liability company interest may become a member upon . . . [t]he approval of all of the members of the limited liability company other than the member assigning his or her limited liability company interest.\u201d RCW 25.15-.260(1)(a) (emphasis added). Given the strong protection of LLC members\u2019 voluntary associational interests, comparable to partnerships, the Court of Appeals did not err in applying Finkelstein to Ostenson\u2019s case and affirming the dismissal of his derivative claim.\n\u00b629 Ostenson does not effectively argue otherwise. He cites to Summit Investment & Development Corp. v. Leroux, 69 F.3d 608 (1st Cir. 1995), for the proposition that \u00a7 541(c)(1) and \u00a7 365(e)(1) invalidate or render unenforceable ipso facto bankruptcy clauses. But the Summit court addressed only \u00a7 365(e) and did not undertake any analysis of \u00a7 541. Id. at 614 n.8. And while the First Circuit indeed held in Summit that \u00a7 365(e) preempted a Massachusetts statute comparable to RCW 25.15.130(1)(d)(ii), the Ninth Circuit expressly rejected Summit's approach in In re Catapult Entertainment, Inc., 165 F.3d 747 (9th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 528 U.S. 924 (1999). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals noted that under the statute\u2019s plain language, while \u00a7 365(e)(1) nullifies ipso facto clauses, \u201c\u00a7 365(e)(2)(A) expressly revives \u2018ipso facto\u2019 clauses\u201d under the circumstances noted therein. Id. at 753 n.6. The Ninth Circuit held, \u201c[W]here applicable nonbankruptcy law makes an executory contract nonassignable because the identity of the nondebtor party is material, a debtor in possession may not assume the contract absent consent of the nondebtor party.\u201d Id. at 754-55. As noted, RCW 25.15.250(1)(a) and RCW 25.15.260(1)(a) of the WALLCA require the express approval of the LLC nondebtor members regarding any transfer or assumption of member management rights. To the extent the LLC operating agreement may qualify as an executory contract concerning management, the noted \u201capplicable law excuses a party, other than the debtor!, i.e., the nondebtor members], . . . from accepting performance from or rendering performance to ... an assignee,\u201d and \u201csuch party], i.e., the nondebtor members, have] not consented] to such assumption or assignment.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(e)(2)(A). Accordingly, \u00a7 365(e)(2)\u2019s exception to \u00a7 365(e)(1)\u2019s prohibition of ipso facto provisions applies.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b630 We conclude that HDs did not waive their CR 41 motion to dismiss and that federal bankruptcy law, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 541 or 365, does not preempt RCW 25.15-.130(1)(d)\u2019s dissociation provision. As to the latter issue, we hold that state law defines what the bankruptcy debtor\u2019s interests are and that \u00a7 541 brings such interests into the bankruptcy estate, burdened by whatever state law requires. Additionally, if executory contracts are involved, \u00a7 365 applies to determine what may be done with such contracts. But here, the express protections of associational rights of nondebtor members found in the WALLCA triggers \u00a7 365(e)(2)\u2019s exception, rendering \u00a7 365(e)(1)\u2019s prohibition against ipso facto clauses inapplicable. We affirm.\nJohnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, Gordon McCloud, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nThe legislature amended the WALLCA in May 2015, repealing the provisions discussed herein and reissuing them in a revised but substantively comparable form relevant to the present matter, effective January 1, 2016. See Laws of 2015, ch. 188. All references to the WALLCA (ch. 25.15 RCW) in this opinion are to the version of that act in effect prior to the January 1, 2016 effective date of the noted amendment.\nIn making this argument, Ostenson relied on the WALLCA, arguing that the consent exception to the dissociation provision found in RCW 25.15.130(1)(d) applied to bar HDs\u2019 challenge to Ostenson\u2019s standing to bring the derivative action. Ostenson also argued that \u201cin addition to the RCW [i.e., RCW 25.15-,130(1)(d), which provided a consent exception to the dissociation provision], Your Honor, they [HDs] should be judicially and equitably estopped\u2019\u2019 from challenging Ostenson\u2019s standing to bring a derivative action. 3 Verbatim Report of Proceeding at 601. Ostenson reasserted those contentions on appeal (consent, judicial estoppel, collateral estoppel, and res judicata), but the Court of Appeals rejected each contention and affirmed the trial court. See Nw. Wholesale, Inc. v. Pac Organic Fruit, LLC, 183 Wn. App. 459, 490-93, 334 P.3d 63 (2014), review granted, 182 Wn.2d 1009, 343 P.3d 759 (2015). Ostenson abandoned the issues of consent, judicial estoppel, collateral estoppel, and res judicata in his petition for review.\nCR 41(b)(3) provides:\nAfter the plaintiff, in an action tried by the court without a jury, has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant, without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. The court as trier of the facts may then determine them and render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence. If the court renders judgment on the merits against the plaintiff, the court shall make findings as provided in rule 52(a). Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subsection . . . operates as an adjudication upon the merits.\nCf. State v. Eide, 2 Wn. App. 789, 791, 470 P.2d 220 (1970) (where appellant, at the end of the state\u2019s case, started to move to dismiss, but was told by the trial judge that he could do so later without waiving his rights and then testified in his own behalf, \u201cdefendant had a right to rely upon the assurance of the trial court that he could introduce evidence without waiving his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence at the close of the state\u2019s case\u2019\u2019).\nHDs argued in part to both the trial court and to the Court of Appeals that Ostenson\u2019s preemption assertion, which was first raised in his motion for reconsideration, was untimely. The trial court denied Ostenson\u2019s motion for reconsideration. On appeal, Division Three rejected HDs\u2019 reasserted timeliness argument, stating, \u201c \u2018By bringing a motion for reconsideration under CR 59, a party may preserve an issue for appeal that is closely related to a position previously asserted and does not depend upon new facts.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Nw. Wholesale, 183 Wn. App. at 480 (quoting River House Dev. Inc. v. Integras Architecture, PS, 167 Wn. App. 221, 231, 272 P.3d 289 (2012)). HDs have not raised the timeliness issue in this court, and we express no opinion on the Court of Appeals discussion of timeliness and issue preservation.\nOstenson\u2019s arguments regarding the applicability of \u00a7 365 have been a moving target. To the Court of Appeals and in his petition for review, Ostenson argued that \u00a7 365(e)(1) prohibitions applied to the LLC operating agreement here as an executory contract. In his reply in support of his petition, he stated that the operating agreement was not an executory contract and that \u00a7 365 did not apply. But in his supplemental brief, he argues that \u00a7 365(e)(1) does apply and raises two new arguments contending that \u00a7 365(e)(2)\u2019s exception to \u00a7 365(e)(1)\u2019s ipso facto clause prohibitions (discussed below) does not apply here.\nSee also RCW 25.15.370, which provides:\nA member may bring an action in the superior courts in the right of a limited liability company to recover a judgment in its favor if managers or members with authority to do so have refused to bring the action or if an effort to cause those managers or members to bring the action is not likely to succeed.\n(Emphasis added.)\nRCW 25.15.250(1) and (2)(a) provide in relevant part, \u201cThe assignee of a member\u2019s limited liability company interest shall have no right to participate in the management of the business and affairs of a limited liability company,\u2019\u2019 and \u201c[a]n assignment entitles the assignee to share in such profits and losses, to receive such distributions, and to receive such allocation of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit or similar item to which the assignor was entitled, to the extent assigned.\u201d\nUnder \u00a7 541(b)(1), the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy estate expressly does not include \u201cany power that the debtor may exercise solely for the benefit of an entity other than the debtor,\u201d which, by definition, would appear to include a derivative claim, the sole purpose of which is to benefit the entity.\nWhile Garrison-Ashburn has been criticized by some subsequent cases, see, e.g., In re Ktingerrnan, 388 B.R. 677, 679 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2008), other cases agree with Garrison-Ashburn s approach. For instance, In re Albright, 291 B.R. 538, 540 n.7 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2003), observed:\nWhere a single member files bankruptcy while the other members of a multi-member LLC do not, . . . the bankruptcy estate is only entitled to receive the share of profits or other compensation by way of income and the return of the contributions to which that member would otherwise be entitled.\nAdditional cases that follow Garrison-Ashburn s approach include In re Western Asbestos Co., 313 B.R. 832, 844 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 2003) (\u201cThe Court views the meaning of\u2018property,\u2019 as used in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(c)(1)(B), as something that may be sold or collected to generate funds to be distributed funds to creditors.\u2019\u2019); In re A-Z Electronics, LLC, 350 B.R. 886, 890 n.12 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2006) (citing Albright with approval); Fotouhi, Epps, Hillger & Gilroy v. Mansdorf, 427 B.R. 798, 802 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 2010) (partner dissociated upon filing bankruptcy); and Milford Power Co. v. PDC Milford Power, LLC, 866 A.2d 738, 759-61 (Del. Ch. 2004) (holding that neither \u00a7 365 nor \u00a7 541 preempted state law provisions that deprive bankrupt members of governance rights).\nSee Klingerman, 388 B.R. at 679 (no mention of Butner and no analysis of threshold determination of debtor\u2019s interest as determined by state law); In re LaHood, 437 B.R. 330 (Bankr. C.D. Ill. 2010) (same); In re Dixie Mgmt. & Inv., Ltd. Partners, 474 B.R. 698 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 2011) (same).\nThe Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel in First Protection acknowledged the distinction made in Albright (quoted above) that a different result would obtain where the LLC member who files a bankruptcy petition belongs to a single-member LLC or a multiple-member LLC. See First Prot., 440 B.R. at 829 n.13.\nNo party has argued that Ostenson\u2019s bankruptcy filing resulted in dissolution. But the operating agreement provides that \u201cthe Company shall dissolve upon ... the occurrence of any event of Member dissociation provided in the Act... unless the business of the Company is continued with the consent of all of the remaining Members within ninety (90) days following such event.\u2019\u2019 Defs.\u2019 Ex. 5 (Pac Organic Fruit LLC Agreement, page 13 (Article 8.1)). Presumably, Pac-O continued operating with the consent of the remaining member, GHI.\nTwo recent cases from Virginia demonstrate the lack of coherence in this area. In In re Virginia Broadband, LLC, 498 B.R. 90, 93-94 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2013), a bankruptcy court addressed application of a state statute that dissociated an LLC member upon becoming a debtor in bankruptcy and thereby transformed the member\u2019s interest into that of an assignee with only economic interests. Purporting to rely on Garrison-Ashburn, the Broadband court held that the state statute in question was an invalid ipso facto provision under \u00a7 541(c)(1)(B) and that the debtor\u2019s economic and noneconomic interests in the LLC became property of his bankruptcy estate. Id. at 96-97. However, in In re Williams, 455 B.R. 485 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2011), another court, applying the same statute and also purporting to apply Garrison-Ashburn, came to the opposite conclusion. The Williams court held that \u00a7 541(c)(1) \u201cclearly controls\u2019\u2019 and that the two debtors\u2019 interests vested in their respective estates, but that such interest was determined by the state statute. Thus, as defined by the state statute, a dissociated member retained only economic rights, and since both LLC members had been dissociated through bankruptcy and no one was left to wind up the affairs of the LLC, the court would appoint a liquidating trustee to do so. Id. at 501-02. Such ambiguities support applying a \u201c\u2018strong presumption\u2019\u2019\u2019 against finding preemption of RCW 25.15-.130(1)(d)\u2019s dissociation provision. Hue, 127 Wn.2d at 78 (quoting Progressive, 125 Wn.2d at 265).\nSimilarly, \u00a7 365(c) provides in part:\nThe trustee may not assume or assign any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor, whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of duties, if\u2014\n(1)(A) applicable law excuses a party, other than the debtor, to such contract or lease from accepting performance from or rendering performance to an entity other than the debtor or the debtor in possession, whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of duties; and\n(B) such party does not consent to such assumption or assignment ....\n(Emphasis added.)\nOstenson argues in his petition that the LLC\u2019s operating agreement is an executory contract and thus subject to the ipso facto prohibition in \u00a7 365(e)(1), but in his reply he contends that \u00a7 365 does not apply. Then he reasserts in his supplemental brief that \u00a7 365(e)(1) does apply while raising two new arguments to avoid \u00a7 365(e)(2)\u2019s exception to \u00a7 365(e)(1)\u2019s prohibition. In any event, as the Court of Appeals held, it ultimately does not matter whether the Pac-O operating agreement qualifies as an executory contract because, even if it does, under the circumstances of Ostenson\u2019s case \u00a7 365(e)(2) would apply to negate the application of \u00a7 365(e)(1)\u2019s prohibition, as explained herein.\nExecutory contracts do not automatically devolve to the bankruptcy estate.\n\u201cThe trustee\u2019s power to reject those executory contracts which he finds burdensome to the bankrupt\u2019s estate is an extension of his power to renounce title to and abandon burdensome property which is already a part of the estate. Because executory contracts . . . involve future liabilities as well as rights, however, an affirmative act of assumption by the trustee is required to bring the property into the estate in order to ensure that the estate is not charged with the liabilities except upon due deliberation. Thus, executory contracts . . . \u2014unlike all other assets\u2014do not vest in the trustee as of the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition. They vest only upon the trustee\u2019s timely and affirmative act of assumption.\u2019\u2019\nFirst Prot., 440 B.R. at 830 (alterations in original) (quoting In re Lovitt, 757 F.2d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. 1985)).\nSee also Sally S. Neely, Partnerships and Partners and Limited Liability Companies and Members in Bankruptcy: Proposals for Reform, 71 Am. Bankr. L.J. 271, 317 (1997) (\u201c[BJecause of the similarities between LLCs and partnerships in this area of inquiry, the cases [involving partnerships] also provide guidance regarding the appropriate consequences of the bankruptcy of a member or member-manager of a[n] LLC.\u201d).\nOstenson raises two new issues in his supplemental brief. First, he contends that because his bankruptcy petition was filed under chapter 11 (reorganization), he is a debtor in possession and thus he may be treated as the same entity before and after his bankruptcy filing. Because there will be no assignment of the operating agreement to a different entity, the \u00a7 365(e)(2) exception to \u00a7 365(e)(1)\u2019s prohibition to ipso facto provisions is not triggered. Second, Ostenson contends that the stipulation entered in his bankruptcy proceeding qualifies as the required consent under \u00a7 365(c)(1)(A) and \u00a7 365(e)(2) and thus the \u00a7 365(e)(2) exception is not triggered. See Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Suppl. Br. at 17-20. We decline to address Ostenson\u2019s newly raised arguments. \u201cUnder the Rules of Appellate Procedure, \u2018the Supreme Court will review only the questions raised in . . . the petition for review and the answer, unless the Supreme Court orders otherwise upon the granting of the . . . petition.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Denaxas v.

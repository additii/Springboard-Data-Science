J. Pryor in said-district, to-wit:\nWest one-half, southeast one-fourth, sec. 5, Twp. 6, range 5. Southwest one-fourth, sec. 5, Twp. 6, range 5. South one-half, northwest one-fourth, sec. 5, Twp. 6, range 5. Southwest one-fourth, northeast one-fourth, sec. 5, Twp. 6, range 5.\nAppellant, to whom T. J. Pryor mortgaged the land, intervened in the suit and specifically pleaded the statute of limitations in defense of the collection of the delinquent taxes.\nThe trial court ruled that the delinquent assessments were not barred by the statute of limitations and dismissed appellant\u2019s intervention for the want of equity, from which is this appeal.\nSection 6831 of Crawford & Moses\u2019 Digest controls, and by it a lien is created upon the lands within the district for the assessment of benefits until paid.\nThe decree is therefore affirmed.",

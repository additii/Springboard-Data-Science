        "text": "Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\nf 1 We are asked today to decide whether Samuel Piatnitsky unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent when he told police investigating a murder that \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk right now\u201d but that he would \u201cwrite it down.\u201d We find that this is, at best, an equivocal invocation of the right to remain silent, and thus, the trial judge did not err in admitting Piatnitsky\u2019s written confession. We affirm.\nFACTS\n\u00b62 In the early hours of October 19, 2008, Samuel Piatnitsky and his friend Jason Young were asked to leave a party. They refused. A fight broke out, and eventually Piatnitsky and Young left. But, approximately 30 minutes later, they returned with Piatnitsky brandishing a shotgun. Announcing his return to the partygoers, Piatnitsky exclaimed something to the effect of \u201c \u2018what\u2019s up now,\u2019 \u201d chambered a round, and fired a shot. Clerk\u2019s Papers at 3. Shawn Jones, the victim in the case, grabbed the shotgun and began wrestling with Piatnitsky. Young pulled Jones off Piatnitsky, who then fired three more shots, killing Jones and injuring another person.\n\u00b63 King County Sheriff\u2019s deputies were dispatched to the scene around 3:30 in the morning. A K-9 unit followed a track from the crime scene to Young\u2019s house. Young came out when summoned by the officers; Piatnitsky was found hiding in the basement of the house. Officers Mirandized Piatnitsky, and he confessed to shooting Jones and another partygoer. Witnesses brought to the scene of the arrest identified Piatnitsky as the shooter. He was taken into custody and booked.\n\u00b64 Later that morning, Detectives Keller and Allen interviewed Piatnitsky about the shooting. After about an hour of questioning during which Piatnitsky indicated he was willing to give a taped confession, the detectives turned on a tape recorder. The relevant portion of the taped interview went as follows:\nDET: Okay, and earlier you were advised of your Miranda rights. Do you remember that, your Constitutional rights by the officer, do you remember that?\nSUS: Yeah; I have a right . . .\nDET: Did you understand those?\nSUS: I have a right to remain silent.\nDET: Right. I\u2019m gonna go ahead and . . .\nSUS: That\u2019s the, that\u2019s the only one I remember.\nDET: Okay. I\u2019m gonna read 'em for you again.\nSUS: That\u2019s the one I, I should be doing right now.\nDET: Well, you know, like we told you, you don\u2019t have to talk to us. Okay. You\u2019ve already admitted to this thing. We want to go on tape, and because it\u2019s an important part of this, and we talked about that, and that\u2019s the part when you go back to get the shotgun. Before we do any of that, I want to read you . . .\nSUS: What are you guys talking about, man?\nDET: I want to read you your rights, okay. Do you understand that you have the right to remain silent?\nDET2: You gotta answer out loud, SAM.\nSUS: I\u2019m not ready to do this, man.\nDET2: You just told us that you wanted to get it in your own words on tape. You asked us to turn the tape on; remember?\nSUS: I just write it down, man. I can\u2019t do this. I, I, I just write, man. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want. . .\nDET: Okay.\nSUS: I don\u2019t want to talk right now, man.\nPretrial Ex. 3, at 1-2 (alterations in original). The detectives Mirandized Piatnitsky again, and he signed a waiver form. During the recording, the detectives clarified their understanding of the situation:\nDET2: Are you sure you don\u2019t want to do it on tape like you said you did; you want to get in your own words?\nSUS: Yes, sir.\nDET2: Okay.\nDET: So you\u2019d rather take a written statement, do a written one.\nSUS: Yes. I don\u2019t know (unintelligible)[.]\nDET: Okay, it\u2019s too hard to talk about; you\u2019d rather write it.\nId. at 4. Both detectives testified that the unintelligible portion of the recording was Piatnitsky stating once again that he did not want to make an audio-recorded confession. The detectives complied with that request and stopped recording. Instead, one of the detectives wrote down Piatnitsky\u2019s version of the events, which Piatnitsky edited. At some point, Piatnitsky did not like where the questioning was going and he told detectives he was finished and cut off the interview. The detectives stopped asking questions and finished the statement. Piatnitsky then reviewed everything that had been written, requested some changes, and signed the corrected statement.\n\u00b65 Ultimately, Piatnitsky was charged with murder in the first degree, among other things. Before the trial, he challenged the admissibility of his written statement to the police, arguing that he did not waive his right to remain silent knowingly and voluntarily. The trial judge conducted a CrR 3.5 hearing and found that all of Piatnitsky\u2019s statements, written and oral, were admissible because Piatnitsky was able to knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his rights despite his emotional and physical state at the time of interrogation. Piatnitsky was convicted of murder in the first degree, attempted murder in the first degree, possession of a stolen firearm, and unlawful possession of a firearm in the second degree. The trial court imposed a standard-range sentence of 600 months. Piatnitsky appealed, arguing, among other things, that the trial court should have suppressed his statements because he had successfully invoked his right to silence. State v. Piatnitsky, 170 Wn. App. 195, 210-11, 282 P.3d 1184 (2012). The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court in a split-panel decision. We granted review on the suppression issue alone and now affirm. State v. Piatnitsky, 176 Wn.2d 1022, 299 P.3d 1171 (2013).\nANALYSIS\n\u00b66 Piatnitsky argues that his statements must be suppressed because he unequivocally invoked his Fifth Amendment right to silence. See Pet\u2019r\u2019s Combined Suppl. Br. at 10. We disagree. His statement, when examined in context, was at best an equivocal invocation of that right. While the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk right now, man\u201d could be an unequivocal invocation of the right to silence, it was not uttered in isolation. The context here shows equivocation by Piatnitsky. He did not just say \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk right now, man\u201d; he said, \u201cI just write it down, man. I can\u2019t do this. I, I, I just write, man. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want... I don\u2019t want to talk right now, man.\u201d Pretrial Ex. 3, at 2 (alteration in original).\n\u00b67 To be unequivocal, an invocation of Miranda requires the expression of an objective intent to cease communication with interrogating officers. Piatnitsky did not express such an intent. Instead, as the detectives reasonably understood, he said he would rather write than talk. Because Miranda rights cannot be partially invoked and must be exercised in an objectively clear way, we affirm the lower courts.\n\u00b68 Prior to any custodial interrogation, a suspect must be informed that \u201che has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning.\u201d Miranda, 384 U.S. at 479. Any waiver of these rights by the suspect must be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. State v. Radcliffe, 164 Wn.2d 900, 905-06,194 P.3d 250 (2008) (citing Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 482, 101 S. Ct. 1880, 68 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1981)). Even once waived, a suspect can invoke these rights at any point during the interview and the interrogation must cease. Id. at 906 (citing Edwards, 451 U.S. at 484-85).\n\u00b69 Here, we are asked whether Piatnitsky unequivocally invoked his right to silence before the detectives took his written statement. We find that because the detectives reasonably concluded that Piatnitsky was expressing a preference for a written rather than an audio-recorded statement, any invocation of his Miranda rights was equivocal at best.\n\u00b610 As we stated in Radcliffe, \u201c[T]he United States Supreme Court has decided the [equivocal invocation of Miranda] issue and we must follow its holding as it applies to the Fifth Amendment. Davis [v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1994),] is the law under the federal constitution.\u201d 164 Wn.2d at 907. On the similar issue before us, we maintain that Davis controls our analysis.\n\u00b611 Though both Radcliffe and Davis dealt with the invocation of the right to counsel, we draw no distinctions between the invocations of different Miranda rights. We have been instructed that \u201cthere is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to counsel.\u201d Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U.S. 370, 381, 130 S. Ct. 2250, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1098 (2010). Here, we faithfully adhere to this instruction and apply the rules articulated in Davis and Radcliffe to an alleged invocation of the right to silence.\n\u00b612 It is well established that Miranda rights must be invoked unambiguously. Davis, 512 U.S. at 459; Radcliffe, 164 Wn.2d at 906. This is a bright-line inquiry; a statement either is \u201c \u2018an assertion of [Miranda rights] or it is not.\u2019 \u201d Davis, 512 U.S. at 459 (quoting Smith v. Illinois, 469 U.S. 91, 97-98, 105 S. Ct. 490, 83 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1984)). Also, this inquiry is objective. Id. In other words, an invocation must be sufficiently clear \u201cthat a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be [an invocation of Miranda rights].\u201d Id. And so, that is the question before us here. As a matter of law, was it reasonable for the detectives to conclude that the right to silence was not invoked?\n\u00b613 Looking at the context, the detectives interrogating Piatnitsky could reasonably conclude that he never actually invoked his right to silence. In response to a question about whether he understood his Miranda rights, Piatnitsky said, \u201cI have a right to remain silent. . . . That\u2019s the, that\u2019s the only one I remember.... That\u2019s the one I, I should be doing right now.\u201d Pretrial Ex. 3, at 2 (alterations in original). Piatnitsky himself admits that he should have been exercising his right to silence, which, when properly understood, means that he was not actually doing so. Immediately after this interaction, one of the detectives explained that he wanted to get a recording of Piatnitsky\u2019s confession but that he first wanted to go through Miranda once again. To this, Piatnitsky responded, \u201cI\u2019m not ready to do this, man.\u201d Id. The detective asked for a clarification because earlier Piatnitsky had indicated willingness to confess on audio recording. Piatnitsky obliged, saying, \u201cI just write it down, man. I can\u2019t do this. I, I, I just write, man. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want... I don\u2019t want to talk right now, man.\u201d Id. (alteration in original). The detective agreed and told Piatnitsky, \u201cOkay, but let\u2019s go over the rights on tape, and then you can write it down, okay.\u201d Id. Piatnitsky confirmed the detective\u2019s understanding of the statement by saying, \u201cAll right, man.\u201d Id. Thus, when Piatnitsky said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk right now, man,\u201d his invocation of Miranda was equivocal at best. Id. The detective reasonably concluded that Piatnitsky was expressing a preference for the means of communication.\n\u00b614 The undisputed record shows that Piatnitsky understood he had a right to silence that he was not exercising. And when Piatnitsky expressed some hesitation about the questioning, the record indicates that the interrogating detective clarified Piatnitsky\u2019s desire and received confirmation that the hesitation was about making an audio-recorded statement. The detectives reasonably concluded that Piatnitsky\u2019s statements were a preference for a written statement over a recorded one. The reasonableness of this conclusion is supported by audio recording, transcript, and testimony.\n\u00b615 It is well established that when an accused makes a statement concerning the right to remain silent \u201c \u2018that is ambiguous or equivocal\u2019 or makes no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation or ask questions to clarify whether the accused wants to invoke his or her Miranda rights.\u201d Berghuis, 560 U.S. at 381 (citation omitted) (quoting Davis, 512 U.S. at 459). Piatnitsky\u2019s statement was at least ambiguous or equivocal, and so the interrogating detectives were not required to end the interrogation. As in Berghuis, we find that the \u201c [suppression of a voluntary confession in these circumstances would place a significant burden on society\u2019s interest in prosecuting criminal activity.\u201d Id. at 382.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b616 Piatnitsky did not unequivocally invoke his right to remain silent. It was reasonable for the detectives to interpret Piatnitsky\u2019s statements as an expression of preference for making a written confession rather than an audio-recorded one. Piatnitsky\u2019s statement was a conditional invocation of Miranda. Under Radcliffe, such an invocation must be viewed as equivocal or ambiguous. 164 Wn.2d at 907. Under Berghuis, such an invocation does not require law enforcement to ask for clarification or suspend questioning. 560 U.S. at 381. We find the statements were properly admitted at trial and affirm.\nMadsen, C.J.; C. Johnson and Owens, JJ.; and J.M. Johnson, J. Pro Tem., concur.\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).\nU.S. Const. amend. V.\nMiranda, 384 U.S. 436.\nIn the alternative, Piatnitsky argues that even if his invocation of the right to silence was equivocal, article I, section 9 of our state constitution limits law enforcement to clarifying questions when such an invocation is made. See Pet\u2019r\u2019s Combined Suppl. Br. at 20, 30. Piatnitsky did not raise this argument at trial, at the Court of Appeals, or in his petition for discretionary review. We decline to reach it. See RAP 13.7(b); State v. Radcliffe, 164 Wn.2d 900, 907, 194 P.3d 250 (2008).\nSpecifically, the detective said, \u201cYou just told us that you wanted to get it in your own words on tape. You asked us to turn the tape on; remember?\u201d Pretrial Ex. 3, at 2.",

        "text": "Wiggins, J.\n\u00b617 (dissenting) \u2014 Has a suspect unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent when he tells police \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk right now\u201d? The majority answers this question in the negative, and I respectfully dissent. We should hold that Samuel Piatnitsky unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent when he said those very words during a police interrogation. While he qualified his invocation of rights with his assent to \u201cwrite it down,\u201d he was not allowed to write anything down. Rather, the police continued their interrogation. Although the police wrote down a statement in the process and Piatnitsky signed the statement, these subsequent facts do not make equivocal his earlier statement that \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk right now.\u201d The majority opinion whittles away the right to be free from self-incrimination and ignores the inherently coercive nature of custodial interrogation.\nA. An invocation of Miranda rights must be unequivocal in context\n\u00b618 As the Supreme Court recognized in Miranda, the pressures inherent to custodial interrogations naturally tend to push suspects to talk to the police, encouraging them to waive their constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 457-58, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). As a means of assuring that a suspect\u2019s choice to talk to the police is made freely, Miranda requires the police to inform suspects of their right to remain silent and their right to the presence of an attorney. Id. at 479. A suspect may choose to invoke these rights at any time prior to or during questioning. Id. at 472-73.\n\u00b619 A suspect\u2019s invocation of Miranda rights may be equivocal or unequivocal. If the suspect\u2019s invocation is equivocal, then officers may carry on questioning. Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 461-62, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1994). They are not required to cease the interrogation or clarify whether or not the suspect actually meant to invoke Miranda. Id. However, if the invocation is unequivocal, the police must stop their questioning immediately. They may not resume discussion with the suspect until the suspect himself or herself reinitiates further communication with the police or counsel is made available to the suspect. Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S. Ct. 1880, 68 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1981).\n\u00b620 An invocation of Miranda rights is unequivocal so long as a \u201creasonable police officer in the circumstances\u201d would understand it to be an assertion of the suspect\u2019s rights. Davis, 512 U.S. at 459. This test encompasses both the plain language and the context of the suspect\u2019s purported invocation. Therefore, when a suspect says, \u201c \u2018Maybe I should talk to a lawyer\u2019 \u201d and subsequently clarifies that \u201c[\u2018] [n]o, I\u2019m not asking for a lawyer,\u2019 \u201d the suspect has not invoked his Miranda rights and questioning may continue. Id. at 455 (first alteration in original). On the other hand, when a police officer tells a suspect about his right to have a lawyer present and the suspect says, \u201c \u2018Uh, yeah, I\u2019d like to do that,\u2019 \u201d the suspect has unequivocally invoked Miranda rights and the officer must stop the questioning immediately. Smith v. Illinois, 469 U.S. 91, 93, 105 S. Ct. 490, 83 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1984).\n\u00b621 The Supreme Court has additionally created a third category of invocations that are unequivocal but limited in scope. In Connecticut v. Barrett, 479 U.S. 523, 525, 107 S. Ct. 828, 93 L. Ed. 2d 920 (1987), the defendant refused to give a written statement without an attorney present but told the police that \u201c \u2018he had no problem in talking about the incident\u2019 \u201d and proceeded to give an inculpatory oral statement. The Supreme Court held that in light of the \u201ctenor or sense of a defendant\u2019s responses to [Miranda] warnings,\u201d the defendant had not unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent. Id. at 528. The Court noted that \u201cBarrett\u2019s limited requests for counsel . . . were accompanied by affirmative announcements of his willingness to speak with the authorities.\u201d Id. at 529 (emphasis added). That is, Barrett\u2019s invocation of his right not to give a written statement was clear. But it did not equate to an invocation of his right not to talk because he explicitly said he had \u201c \u2018no problem\u2019 \u201d doing so. Id. at 525. Thus, when Barrett proceeded to talk, evidence of his oral statement was admissible.\n\u00b622 The Supreme Court has also limited the context a court may consider in determining whether the invocation of the right to remain silent was unequivocal. We may not rely on statements made after the suspect\u2019s purported invocation in order to retroactively cast doubt on a facially clear and unequivocal invocation of Miranda rights. Smith, 469 U.S. at 99. In Smith, the defendant was advised of his right to have counsel present and told the police, \u201c \u2018Uh, yeah, I\u2019d like to do that.\u2019 \u201d 469 U.S. at 93. Rather than cutting off discussion, the police proceeded to finish reading Smith his Miranda rights and asked him, \u201c \u2018Do you wish to talk to me at this time without a lawyer being present?\u2019 \u201d and Smith answered, \u201c \u201cYeah and no, uh, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s what, really.\u2019 \u201d Id. The trial court seized on Smith\u2019s latter statement as proof that Smith\u2019s invocation of Miranda had been equivocal and admitted evidence of Smith\u2019s statements to police. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that \u201c[w]here nothing about the request... or the circumstances leading up to the request would render it ambiguous, all questioning must cease.\u201d Id. at 98 (emphasis added). In other words, what the accused said after invoking his Miranda rights might be relevant to waiver but it was not relevant to the invocation itself. Id. Smith\u2019s statement that \u201cI\u2019d like to [get a lawyer]\u201d was not ambiguous on its face and did not become so because he later said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s what.\u201d Id. at 93.\n\u00b623 Pursuant to Supreme Court precedent, I now analyze Piatnitsky\u2019s statements, and the context leading up to his statements, to determine whether his invocation of Miranda was unequivocal and, if so, what scope it covered.\nB. Piatnitsky unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent\n\u00b624 The majority concludes that Piatnitsky equivocally invoked his Miranda rights when he said, \u201c T don\u2019t want to talk right now, man.\u2019 \u201d Majority at 414 (quoting Pretrial Ex. 3, at 2). I disagree. The context leading up to Piatnitsky\u2019s statement indicates that his statement was unequivocal, albeit limited. The detectives did not abide by Piatnitsky\u2019s clear refusal to talk, and the statement they prepared for him should not have been admitted.\n\u00b625 Piatnitsky told the detectives, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk right now.\u201d On its face, there is nothing equivocal or ambiguous about this statement: he did not use equivocal words like \u201cmaybe\u201d or conditional words like \u201cif.\u201d A statement that the suspect \u201cwant[s] to remain silent or that he [does] not want to talk with the police\u201d is a \u201csimple, unambiguous statement ]\u201d that cuts off questioning. Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U.S. 370, 382, 130 S. Ct. 2250, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1098 (2010). Piatnitsky made just such a refusal. It is difficult to ask a suspect to phrase a refusal any more clearly than \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk\u201d \u2014 particularly a suspect who was deprived of sleep and who had recently suffered a head injury.\n\u00b626 The trial court found at the CrR 3.5 hearing that Piatnitsky was willing to talk to the police, albeit not on tape. In affirming, the court of appeals relied on three contextual points: first, that Piatnitsky talked with the detectives prior to the audio-recorded interview; second, that Piatnitsky \u201cparticipated fully\u201d in Detective Allen\u2019s preparation of the written statement; and third, that Piatnitsky said he was willing to \u201c \u2018write it down.\u2019 \u201d State v. Piatnitsky, 170 Wn. App. 195, 222-24, 282 P.3d 1184 (2012).\n\u00b627 The first contextual clue, that Piatnitsky was willing to talk with the detectives prior to the audio-recorded statement, is unavailing because a suspect may invoke his Miranda rights at any time. Miranda, 384 U.S. at 473-74. A suspect may talk with the police and then decide to stop talking with them for any or no reason. If a facially clear refusal to talk could be vitiated by the suspect\u2019s prior assent to talk to police, then the Miranda right to halt questioning at any time would be nullified.\n\u00b628 Next, the decision of the Supreme Court in Smith precludes the second contextual clue on which the appellate court relied: that Piatnitsky talked with the detectives after his invocation of Miranda. In Smith, the police continued to question the suspect after he was informed of his right to talk to a lawyer and said, \u201c \u2018Uh, yeah, I\u2019d like to do that.\u2019 \u201d 469 U.S. at 93. The Supreme Court held that further questioning after that point was impermissible, even though the suspect eventually agreed to talk to the police. Id. at 97-98.\n\u00b629 The Smith rule is simple: once the suspect unequivocally invokes his Miranda rights, the police may not continue questioning, not even to ask if the suspect is sure he wants to invoke Miranda. The police here violated this rule, and the fact that Piatnitsky participated in the preparation of the written statement and signed off on it is no more relevant than the fact that the suspect in Smith eventually agreed to talk to the police.\n\u00b630 The third contextual clue is more relevant; it is true, as the Court of Appeals points out, that Piatnitsky qualified his refusal. Immediately prior to saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk . . .,\u201d Piatnitsky stated that \u201cI just write it down . . . .\u201d Pretrial Ex. 3, at 2. Barrett addressed the situation where a suspect agreed to talk while refusing to provide a written statement. This case presents the converse: the suspect agreed to write but refused to talk. Thus, as Piatnitsky\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument, there would be no Miranda issue if the police indeed had ceased their oral conversation with Piatnitsky and had abided by his request to \u201cwrite it down.\u201d\n\u00b631 But the police did not abide by Piatnitsky\u2019s request. They did not give Piatnitsky pen and paper but finished reading him his Miranda rights and then carried on questioning him. As Detective Keller testified at trial:\nQ When you went off tape, did you and Detective Allen proceed to do an interview with the Defendant, just not record it?\nA Yes, that\u2019s correct.\nQ What was your role during this interview?\nA Well, I was taking notes and assisting with questioning.\nQ Did both you and Detective Allen take notes contemporaneously, or was one of you writing the actual statement while one of you was asking questions?\nHow did that work?\nA I asked questions. We both asked questions, and it was kind of a mutual questioning.\nDetective Allen wrote down the actual, what Mr. Piatnitsky wanted on the statement.\nReport of Proceedings (RP) (Sept. 16 & 20, 2010) at 23-24. In other words, the police resumed their questioning, with the only difference being that Detective Allen was writing down Piatnitsky\u2019s answers. As the court of appeals correctly notes, the Supreme Court held in Barrett that where a suspect expresses a clear intention to communicate with the police through one medium and not another, the police may respect the suspect\u2019s choice without running afoul of Miranda. 479 U.S. at 529. And the court of appeals\u2019 reliance on Barrett would be proper if the police had indeed respected Piatnitsky\u2019s choice of medium. They did not; they continued to talk to him after he said he did not want to talk. Piatnitsky\u2019s invocation of his Miranda rights was clear and unequivocal as to talking, and yet the police persisted in talking to Piatnitsky. The majority ignores this fact and, instead, gives too much deference to police interrogators at the expense of protecting defendants\u2019 rights.\n\u00b632 The trial court should not have admitted Piatnitsky\u2019s statements, and this error was not harmless. While the State presented substantial evidence aside from Piatnitsky\u2019s confession to rebut Piatnitsky\u2019s theory of self-defense, that evidence was not so overwhelming as to require a jury to reject Piatnitsky\u2019s theory and convict him. I would require a new trial.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b633 Piatnitsky\u2019s statement that \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk right now, man\u201d was a limited refusal, in the context of his affirmative statement that he would \u201cwrite it down.\u201d Nevertheless, the police did not comply with even this limited refusal. Piatnitsky was not, in fact, allowed to write down his own statement. Rather, the police persisted in talking to Piatnitsky. The fact that they may have done so in furtherance of \u201cwriting it down\u201d for him does not excuse their failure to respect Piatnitsky\u2019s invocation of Miranda. The trial court incorrectly admitted Piatnitsky\u2019s written statement, and the error was not harmless.\n\u00b634 I respectfully dissent.\nFairhurst, Stephens, and Gordon McCloud, JJ., concur with Wiggins, J.\nReconsideration denied July 10, 2014.\nThe Supreme Court has subsequently held that an invocation of the right to remain silent and an invocation of the right to counsel are treated the same way. An invocation of either right is sufficient to terminate an interrogation. Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U.S. 370, 376, 130 S. Ct. 2250, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1098 (2010) (citing Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96, 103, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1975)). Accordingly, we read the cases regarding a suspect\u2019s right to remain silent and a suspect\u2019s right to counsel together.",

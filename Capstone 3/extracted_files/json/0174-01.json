        "text": "Humphreys, J.\nThe questions presented by this appeal are whether a -chattel mortgage executed by appellee, Shain Lumber Company, to W. J. Myers, appellant, on the 23d day of February, 1925, secured an existing indebtedness of $5,382.56, by said appellee to said appellant, for money advanced by appellant to it to operate its lumber business in Harrison, Arkansas. Between the dates of October 24, 1924, and February 23, 1925, appellee borrowed on open account from appellant $8,310.56 to operate its business, and paid appellant on said indebtedness during said period $2,927.99, leaving a balance due appellee on book account of $5,382.56. Appellee was uniable to pay the indebtedness, and needed additional money from time to time to operate its business. Appellant was willing, if secured, to make further advances to appellee for such purpose, provided appellant\u2019s son was employed to manage the business, except the actual operation of the mill, which W. F. Shain, sole owner of the Shain Lumber Company, continued to do. Pursuant to such arrangement, the mortgage in question and a contract for the management of the business were executed. The mortgage and contract are as follows:\n\u201cChattel Mortgage With Power oe Sale.\n\u201cThis indenture, made this 23d day of February, 1925, between the Shain Lumber Company, owned by W. F. Shain, party of the first part, and W. J.

Said lands land findings being used by party of the first part to saw and manufacture lumber and saw materials and for the purpose of receiving lumber, lumber materials for manufacture and shipment. Said party of first part has on said lands 2 rip-saws, 2 bolting machines, 4 saws, 1 cut-off saw, 5-horse power motor electric, all belts, 1 gum-saw; materials about 10,000 feet of walnut and oak and linn timber, and all other tools, implements, lumber and property on said lands. Party of the first part is to operate said plant, to make new improvements, to add new machinery and new tools and new timber material, but all the aforesaid are to be included in this mortgage; and party of the second part may advance additional money, and all of the aforesaid property is hereby mortgaged to secure payment of same.

This contract to be placed in the Farmers\u2019 & Merchants\u2019 Bank of Harrison, Arkansas, in escrow, either party to have a copy.\n\u201cShain Lumber Co.,\n\u201cW. F. Shain, employer.\n\u201cC. P. Myers, employee.\u201d\n\u201cThis February 23, 1925.\u201d\nAfter the execution of the mortgage and contract, and prior to the institution of this suit by appellee against appellant for an accounting, on the theory that they were partners, the business was continued under the management of Charles P. Myers, during which time appellant furnished appellee $17,108.12, upon which appellee paid appellant $17,169.25, which liquidated the principal advanced, with interest thereon, leaving unpaid the money loaned on book account by appellant to appellee up to February 23, 1925, the day the mortgage and contract were executed. \u25a0\nIn the course of the trial of the cause appellant\u2019s attorneys admitted that the note for $10,000 mentioned in the mortgage was never executed. At a later date in the trial they attempted to prove that the note was executed and lost, but the court refused to allow them to do so, because the trial had proceeded on the theory of an open account, and under that theory a master had been appointed to state an account, and, pursuant to the appointment, had filed a final report. At the time of the execution of the mortgage and contract the only indebtedness owed by appellee to appellant was the book account of $5,382.56.\nThe trial court found that appellee never executed a note for $10,000 to appellant on the 23d day of February, 1925, and adjudged that said mortgage did not secure the indebtedness due appellant by appellee at the time on account. He also adjudged that, because the mortgage became due one day after date, it did not secure advances made after the maturity of said mortgage.\nAppellant contends that the trial court incorrectly interpreted the purpose and intent of the mortgage. It is unnecessary to determine the correctness of the construction placed upon the mortgage by the trial court, to the effect that it did not secure advances after the maturity of the mortgage, since all the advances made after maturity were paid during the operation of the business and before this suit was instituted. The payment of the advances eliminated that question.\nWe cannot agree with the trial court\u2019s construction of the mortgage, that it was not intended to and did not secure the book account which appellee owed appellant at the time of the execution of the mortgage and contract. The mortgage recites that it was executed to secure a note of $10,000 of even date, which seenis not to have been executed, and does not refer specifically to the book account. Certainly the mortgage and contract were executed to secure an indebtedness. According to the interpretation of the trial court, it was executed without any purpose or intent to secure any indebtedness, its execution being an idle ceremony. The only existing indebtedness at the time was the book account. The defeasance clause in the mortgage indicates very clearly that the purpose of its execution was to secure an indebtedness then existing. There can be no question that the purpose and intent was to execute a note for $10,000 to secure an indebtedness for that amount. As the only indebtedness then existing was the book account, it is quite apparent that the note was intended to include that sum, and a reading of the mortgage, in connection with the contract providing for a continuation of the business, indicates very clearly that the $10,000 note which was to be executed should also embrace future advances. The mortgage provided that, during the continuation of the business, all machinery and equipment which should be purchased was to be included in the mortgage as security for the indebtedness.\nAppellee cites and relies upon the case of First National Bank of Corning v. Corning Bank & Trust Company, 168 Ark. 17, 268 S. W. 606, as decisive of its contention that the book account was not sufficiently identified in the mortgage to be secured thereby. In the case cited the mortgage described an $80.02 note of even date therewith, and did not mention two notes executed prior thereto. The mortgage contained a defeasance clause which recited that, oh payment of the note, together with all other indebtedness which may be due, the mortgage should be void. The court ruled that the defeasance clause related to \u00a1and secured only indebtedness created by additional advances and not to the indebtedness evidenced by the prior notes. In the case cited the $80.02 note was actually executed and was of even date with the mortgage, and the prior notes were not mentioned. Future advances were mentioned. The distinction between that case and this is that no note was executed in the instant case. There was no note to be secured specifically mentioned as in the case cited. In the instant case an indebtedness was to be secured which was to be covered in a $10,000 note. The only indebtedness existing at the time was a book account, and necessarily wias the indebtedness which was to be covered by or embraced in the note. This court ruled in the case of Carnall v. Duval, 22 Ark. 136, that: \u201cIt is no objection to the validity of a mortgage, if given to secure an existing debt, that such debt is not evidenced by a note or bond, nor that a specified time is not limited for its becoming absolute, or for its foreclosure.\u201d\nOur interpretation of the mortgage, when read in connection with the contract, is that one of the intentions was to secure the only existing indebtedness between the parties at the time, and that all of the assets of appellee were pledged to secure said indebtedness.\nOn account of the error indicated the decree of the court dismissing appellant\u2019s cross-complaint asking for a foreclosure of its mortgage will be reversed, and the cause is remanded with directions to the trial court to foreclose the mortgage for the payment of the indebtedness existing between the parties at the time said mortgage was executed, together with interest thereon.",

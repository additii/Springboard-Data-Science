        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b61 The city of Yakima claims the protection of statutes that were designed to protect the rights of those who engage in First Amendment protected communicative activity. U.S. Const, amend. I. Those statutes \u2014 Washington\u2019s \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d laws \u2014 protect speakers against frivolous, speech-chilling lawsuits. We hold that a governmental entity like Yakima cannot take advantage of the anti-SLAPP statutes at least where, as here, the challenged lawsuit is not based on the government\u2019s own communicative activity. We reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to dismiss as moot Yakima\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s decision to deny Yakima\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. Instead, we hold that the case is ripe for review and reinstate the trial court\u2019s decision to deny Yakima\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nI. A Brief History of Anti-SLAPP Laws in Washington State\n\u00b62 A SLAPP suit is designed to discourage a speaker from voicing his or her opinion. See Segaline v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 169 Wn.2d 467, 473, 238 P.3d 1107 (2010). A commonly used example of such suits is a defamation suit, where the plaintiff brings the suit to silence the defendant through the stress and expense of litigating, and not because the plaintiff has a legitimate claim of defamation. Other state legislatures have recognized the potential threat to free speech \u2014 especially the free speech of those lacking financial resources \u2014 posed by such lawsuits and have enacted laws to discourage them.\n\u00b63 Washington\u2019s first laws of this sort were enacted in 1989. That year, the legislature passed RCW 4.24.500-.520. Laws of 1989, ch. 234, \u00a7 1. Those new enactments, however, addressed the SLAPP problem indirectly: they offered protection only to \u201cindividuals who make good-faith reports to appropriate governmental bodies.\u201d RCW 4.24.500. Thus, although commentators sometimes called them Washington\u2019s \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statutes, \u201cthe [1989] legislation more closely resembles a whistleblower immunity statute.\u201d\n\u00b64 In 2002, the legislature amended RCW 4.24.510. It added a strong policy statement against SLAPP litigation and large statutory damages for a SLAPP litigation target who successfully asserts the statutory defense. Laws of 2002, ch. 232, \u00a7 2. And in 2010, the legislature passed RCW 4.24.525; that new law expanded statutory anti-SLAPP protections beyond suits based on reports to government bodies to include \u201cany claim, however characterized, that is based on an action involving public participation and petition \u201d RCW 4.24.525(2). That statute also establishes procedures independent from those contained in RCW 4.24-.500-.520 for bringing and resolving a motion to strike SLAPP suits and claims, as well as for obtaining damages, costs, and fees. See generally RCW 4.24.525.\nII. Michael Henne\u2019s Suit against the City of Yakima\n\u00b65 In 2011, Michael Henne, a Yakima police officer, filed an employment-related lawsuit against his employer, the city of Yakima. Several other officers had filed complaints about Henne\u2019s behavior, resulting in internal investigations of Henne. Henne\u2019s lawsuit alleged that those other officers\u2019 complaints lodged against him formed a pattern of harassment and retaliation that amounted to a hostile workplace. He sued Yakima for negligent hiring, training, and supervision of its employees, which, he asserted, perpetuated a hostile work environment and entitled him to damages.\n\u00b66 Yakima responded to Henne\u2019s complaint not with an answer but with a motion to strike under RCW 4.24.525, the 2010 anti-SLAPP statute. Yakima\u2019s motion asserted that because Henne\u2019s claims were based on coworker complaints and the city\u2019s resulting internal investigations, the new, broader anti-SLAPP statute applied to those claims. In other words, Yakima claimed the protection of the anti-SLAPP suit law because it received controversial communications from others; Yakima made no communications of its own.\n\u00b67 Henne filed a response to the anti-SLAPP motion along with a motion to amend his complaint. Henne argued that his suit was \u201cnot, as characterized by the Defendant, a complaint about the YPD [Yakima Police Department] internal investigations (the heart of the Defendant\u2019s anti-SLAPP allegations), but rather the improper acts of omission and commission by city employees that negatively impacted the life and employment of the Plaintiff.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 130. Henne asked the court to permit him to amend his complaint to clarify the basis for his claims and to deny Yakima\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion.\n\u00b68 The trial court denied Yakima\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. It found that \u201cif this statute can be used to recover penalties and attorney fees from an individual who\u2019s petitioning the government for redress of grievances, that\u2019s exactly the opposite of the purpose of the statute.\u201d CP at 321. It also granted Henne\u2019s motion to amend. Id.\n\u00b69 Yakima appealed under the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s expedited appeal provision, RCW 4.24.525(5)(d). At the Court of Appeals, Henne argued that Yakima was not a \u201cperson\u201d as defined in the 2010 anti-SLAPP statute, RCW 4.24.525, and therefore could not bring an anti-SLAPP motion in the first place. Yakima contended that governmental entities are among those who may claim the statute\u2019s protection. The Court of Appeals held that Yakima was a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP law and could therefore file an anti-SLAPP motion, but it also held that Henne\u2019s amendment to his complaint rendered Yakima\u2019s appeal moot due to the \u201cremoval of the allegations relating to the City\u2019s internal investigations of Officer Henne.\u201d Henne v. City of Yakima, 177 Wn. App. 583, 588, 313 P.3d 1188 (2013). It therefore dismissed the appeal. Id. at 585. Yakima sought review from this court, and we granted it. 179 Wn.2d 1022, 320 P.3d 718 (2014).\nANALYSIS\nI. Standard of Review\n\u00b610 This court reviews questions of statutory interpretation de novo. State v. Wentz, 149 Wn.2d 342, 346, 68 P.3d 282 (2003). In interpreting statutes, we strive to discern and implement the legislature\u2019s intent. State v. J.P., 149 Wn.2d 444, 450, 69 P.3d 318 (2003). Where the plain language of a statute is unambiguous and \u201cthe legislative intent is apparent, ... we will not construe the statute otherwise.\u201d Id. (citing State v. Wilson, 125 Wn.2d 212, 217, 883 P.2d 320 (1994)). However, plain meaning may be gleaned \u201cfrom all that the Legislature has said in the statute and related statutes which disclose legislative intent about the provision in question.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 11, 43 P.3d 4 (2002).\nII. A Governmental Entity Cannot Be a Moving Party under RCW 4.24.525 If It Is Not the Speaker\n\u00b611 Henne argues that Yakima lacked standing to file an anti-SLAPP motion because Yakima is not a \u201cperson\u201d under RCW 4.24.525. Henne notes that in a previous case this court determined that \u201ca government agency is not a \u2018person\u2019 under RCW 4.24.510.\u201d Segaline, 169 Wn.2d at 473. Therefore, we continued, the Department of Labor and Industries could not take advantage of \u201cthe RCW 4.24.510 immunity\u201d that was designed \u201cto protect the exercise of individuals\u2019 First Amendment rights . . . and rights under article I, section 5 of the Washington State Constitution.\u201d Id. (citing RCW 4.24.510, Historical and Statutory Notes). Henne argues that if a governmental entity is not a person under our anti-SLAPP immunity statutes (RCW 4.24.500-.520), then it cannot ever be a person entitled to sue under the broader 2010 anti-SLAPP statute (RCW 4.24.525).\n\u00b612 Yakima responds that the new RCW 4.24.525 differs significantly from RCW 4.24.510 because the older statute does not define \u201cperson,\u201d while the newer statute does. That new definition states, \u201c \u2018Person\u2019 means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture, or any other legal or commercial entity.\u201d RCW 4.24.525(l)(e). Yakima argues that it is a municipal corporation, or at the very least a legal entity, and therefore government entities will always fit the plain language definition of \u201cperson\u201d under the statute. Yakima\u2019s statutory interpretation argument does not consider the portion of that newer anti-SLAPP statute that explicitly distinguishes between the governmental entity and a \u201cmoving party\u201d who can bring an anti-SLAPP suit. RCW 4.24.525(4)(e). Nor does it consider the portions of that newer anti-SLAPP statute stating that it protects the \u201cright of free speech\u201d and \u201cthe constitutional right of petition,\u201d RCW 4.24.525(2)(e) \u2014 rights that the constitution grants to individuals against the government and not to the government against individuals.\n\u00b613 But we need not reach that broad question of whether Yakima can ever be a moving party under RCW 4.24.525, because there is a more narrow, preliminary question presented here. That question is whether the party being sued \u2014 here, Yakima \u2014 engaged in any communicative activity that the statute protects. As discussed below, the answer to that question is no.\na. RCW4.24.525 Protects Speakers Engaged in Communicative Activity\n\u00b614 The legislature enacted Washington\u2019s first anti-SLAPP laws, RCW 4.24.500-.520, because it \u201cwas concerned with civil lawsuits that were being used to intimidate citizens from exercising their First Amendment rights and rights under article I, section 5 of the Washington State Constitution.\u201d Segaline, 169 Wn.2d at 473.\n\u00b615 Similarly, the legislature expanded our antiSLAPP laws in RCW 4.24.525 because it was \u201cconcerned about lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.\u201d Laws of 2010, ch. 118, \u00a7 1(a) (legislative findings and declaration of intent). The legislature continued, \u201cSuch lawsuits, called \u2018Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation\u2019 or \u2018SLAPPs,\u2019 are typically dismissed as groundless or unconstitutional, but often not before the defendants are put to great expense, harassment, and interruption of their productive activities.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1(b). The legislature further explained, \u201cThe costs associated with defending such suits can deter individuals and entities from fully exercising their constitutional rights to petition the government and to speak out on public issues.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1(c) (emphasis added). Thus, the legislature made clear that the purpose of RCW 4.24.525 was to prevent frivolous SLAPP suits from deterring individuals and entities from exercising their constitutional speech rights \u2014 that is, their communicative activity.\n\u00b616 The statute\u2019s plain language reflects the legislature\u2019s stated purpose. It applies to \u201cany claim, however characterized, that is based on an action involving public participation and petition.\u201d RCW 4.24.525(2). An \u201caction involving public participation and petition\u201d is defined as (1) \u201c[a]ny oral statement made, or written statement or other document submitted\u201d in various circumstances, RCW 4.24-.525(2)(a)-(d), and as (2) \u201c[a]ny other lawful conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with an issue of public concern, or in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition,\u201d RCW 4.24.525(2)(e). The statute thus provides protection for a person engaged in some communicative activity \u2014 \u201cma[king]\u201d an oral statement, \u201csubmitting]\u201d a written statement or document, or engaging in other \u201clawful conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech.\u201d RCW 4.24.525(2).\nb. No Provision in RCW 4.24.525 Permits a Nonspeaker To Assert the Rights of a Speaker\n\u00b617 Yakima argues that a claim can be \u201cbased on\u201d communicative activity even if it is not directed against the speaker, i.e., the person engaged in that communicative activity. Thus, Yakima contends, the statute\u2019s protections apply to it, even though it only received communications and did not make any communications of its own.\n\u00b618 We disagree. Such an interpretation stands in stark contrast to the legislature\u2019s concern that SLAPP suits \u201ccan deter individuals and entities from fully exercising their constitutional rights ... to speak out.\u201d Laws of 2010, ch. 118, \u00a7 1(c).\n\u00b619 Moreover, the statute itself makes clear that it does not apply to protect someone other than the speaker whose communicative activity forms the basis of the claim. RCW 4.24.525(l)(c) explains that a \u201c \u2018[mjoving party\u2019 means a person on whose behalf the motion described in subsection (4) of this section is filed seeking dismissal of a claim.\u201d We may therefore frame the question in this case as whether Yakima may be a \u201cmoving party\u201d on whose behalf an anti-SLAPP motion may be filed.\n\u00b620 RCW 4.24.525(4)(e) provides guidance on how to answer that question. It states, \u201cThe attorney general\u2019s office or any government body to which the moving party\u2019s [communicative] acts were directed may intervene to defend or otherwise support the moving party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute thus expressly distinguishes the \u201cmoving party\u201d from the \u201cgovernment body to which the moving party\u2019s acts were directed.\u201d Under the statute, Yakima would be free to intervene to \u201cdefend or otherwise support\u201d the officers who submitted reports to the city, had Henne sued those officers. Certainly the officers themselves, had they been sued, would have standing to challenge the lawsuit under RCW 4.24.525. But the statute does not contemplate that the government body to which speech is directed may itself be a \u201cmoving party.\u201d Instead, it recognizes that the speaker is the \u201cmoving party\u201d and the governmental entity to which the speech is directed is not the \u201cmoving party.\u201d Because Yakima is the government entity to which the speech at issue in this case was directed, and not the speaker, it cannot take advantage of RCW 4.24.525\u2019s anti-SLAPP protections for speakers.\nc. California Law Does Not Control Our Interpretation of RCW 4.24.525\n\u00b621 Yakima urges us to follow California\u2019s law by holding that governmental entities can take advantage of anti-SLAPP laws. Yakima is correct that RCW 4.24.525 is based in part on California\u2019s similar law. As a result, commentators have noted, Washington \u201ccourts have begun using California law to interpret the Washington [anti-SLAPP] Act.\u201d Wyrwich, supra, at 672.\n\u00b622 But despite some similarities, the laws also have significant differences. Id. at 682 (noting that the Washington statute \u201cdiffers in several respects\u201d from the California statute). Most relevant to this case, the California anti-SLAPP statute states that it \u201cshall be construed broadly.\u201d Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 425.16(a). Our legislative findings, on the other hand, state, \u201cThis act shall be applied and construed liberally to effectuate its general purpose of protecting participants in public controversies from an abusive use of the courts.\u201d Laws op 2010, ch. 118, \u00a7 3 (emphasis added). Our legislature thus phrased its findings more narrowly than California\u2019s, emphasizing that the protection extends to \u201cparticipants\u201d \u2014 the actors who speak out on public affairs.\n\u00b623 Moreover, California\u2019s case law does not address the question at issue here; that is, whether the government can take advantage of the anti-SLAPP statute when it was not even the speaker who exercised speech rights. To be sure, some California cases have found that a defendant governmental entity may bring an anti-SLAPP motion under California\u2019s statute. E.g., Bradbury v. Superior Court, 49 Cal. App. 4th 1108, 1117, 57 Cal. Rptr. 2d 207 (1996) (\u201cThe anti-SLAPP suit statute is designed to protect the speech interests of private citizens, the public, and governmental speakers.\u201d). And some California cases have found that a defendant governmental agency may rely on California\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute even where it appears from the facts of the case that the governmental agency received, rather than made, communications. E.g., Hansen v. Cal. Dep\u2019t of Corn & Rehab., 171 Cal. App. 4th 1537, 1544-45, 90 Cal. Rptr. 3d 381 (2008).\n\u00b624 But in no California case did the court ever expressly consider whether a silent governmental defendant could take advantage of an anti-SLAPP statute designed to protect the defendant\u2019s speech. And even if California had considered the question and decided that its statute \u2014 a statute \u201cdesigned to protect the speech interests of . . . governmental speakers,\u201d Bradbury, 49 Cal. App. 4th at 1117 (emphasis added) \u2014 also protected governmental non-speakers, such a conclusion would not be persuasive to our interpretation of our own statute given the difference in legislative findings discussed above.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b625 Given the plain language of RCW 4.24.525 and the legislative findings enacted in Laws of 2010, chapter 118, section 1, we hold that a governmental entity lacks standing to bring an anti-SLAPP motion under RCW 4.24.525 where the governmental entity has not engaged in the communicative activity on which the suit is based. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals to dismiss the appeal. We reinstate the trial court\u2019s orders denying the anti-SLAPP motion and granting the motion to amend. Since Yakima does not prevail, it is not entitled to attorney fees.\nMadsen, C.J., and Owens, Stephens, Wiggins, and Gonz\u00e1lez, JJ., concur.\nA \u201cSLAPP\u201d is a \u201c \u2018Strategic Lawsuit! ] Against Public Participation.\u2019 \u201d Laws of 2010, ch. 118, \u00a7 1(b).\nSee Tom Wyrwich, A Cure for a \u201cPublic Concern\u201d: Washington\u2019s New Anti-SLAPP Law, 86 Wash. L. Rev. 663, 664 (2011).\nMichael E. Johnston, A Better SLAPP Trap: Washington State\u2019s Enhanced Statutory Protection for Targets of \u201cStrategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation,\u201d 38 Gonz. L. Rev. 263, 282 (2003).\nI agree with Justice Fairhurst\u2019s concurrence (at 460) that Henne\u2019s amended complaint did not clearly eliminate all the claims that Yakima targeted in its anti-SLAPP motion. Hence, the question of whether Yakima could take advantage of the 2010 anti-SLAPP statute is squarely before us. And the question of whether an amended complaint that deletes all allegedly objectionable SLAPP claims is not.\nYakima and Henne also argue about whether the Court of Appeals erred when it held that Henne\u2019s amendments to his complaint cured any possible SLAPP problem. But as discussed above, supra note 4, Yakima had the same complaints about the amended complaint. Whether voluntary amendment to delete objectionable claims moots an anti-SLAPP motion is thus an issue left for another day.\nSee United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 480, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2010) (\u201c[T]he First Amendment protects against the government.\u201d); Women Strike for Peace v. Morton, 153 U.S. App. D.C. 198, 472 F.2d 1273, 1280 (1972) (\u201cThe First Amendment was not designed to protect the voice of government or government-approved speech. The First Amendment in this country protects the voice of the people, even against government.\u201d).\nFor this reason, we reject Yakima\u2019s argument that its employees are its agents, and its agents\u2019 actions of submitting reports may thus be considered Yakima\u2019s actions. Yakima cannot avoid the fact that the statute distinguishes between the speaker and the receiver of speech.",

        "text": "Fairhurst, J.\n\u00b626 (concurring in the result) \u2014 The majority correctly concludes that the trial court properly denied the city of Yakima\u2019s special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP motion). As Michael Henne argued to the trial court, he did not bring a SLAPP claim. It was Yakima\u2019s burden to show that Henne\u2019s complaint contained SLAPP claims, and the record shows it failed to do so as a matter of law. I concur.\nI. We should hold Yakima is a \u201cperson\u201d under the anti-SLAPP statute\n\u00b627 Whether Yakima is a \u201cperson\u201d here is a matter of statutory construction dependent on the statutory language. RCW 4.24.525(l)(e) defines a \u201c \u2018person\u2019 \u201d in plain, broad language as \u201can individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture, or any other legal or commercial entity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Yakima is a municipal corporation and clearly a legal entity, so it is a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of RCW 4.24.525(1)(e). Our decision in Segaline v. Department of Labor & Industries, 169 Wn.2d 467, 238 P.3d 1107 (2010), is not controlling on this issue. That case addressed a different statute, RCW 4.24.510, that did not define the word \u201cperson\u201d and used that word ambiguously. Id. at 473. Yakima\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion was not brought under RCW 4.24.510.\nII. We should not reach the issue of mootness\n\u00b628 We should not reach the question of whether Henne\u2019s voluntarily amending his complaint rendered Yakima\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion moot. In this case, Yakima contends that if the trial court had granted its motion, its decision would \u201ccarry through to the amended pleading,\u201d which Yakima asserts did not clearly eliminate all the alleged SLAPP claims. Wash. Supreme Court oral argument, Henne v. City of Yakima, No. 89674-7 (May 29, 2014), at 42 min., 34 sec., audio recording by TVW, Washington State\u2019s Public Affairs Network, http:// www.tvw.org. We are not presented with a case where the amended complaint definitely did remove all alleged SLAPP claims and should therefore not reach the issue of whether such an amended complaint would moot a pending anti-SLAPP motion.\nIII. The trial court properly denied Yakima\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion because Yakima failed to meet its initial burden\n\u00b629 The majority reaches the correct conclusion. Henne argued to the trial court that Yakima\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion must fail, in part, because Henne did not make any SLAPP claims. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 129-30. The record amply supports the conclusion that Henne was correct on that point. Yakima\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion thus fails as a matter of law.\n\u00b630 It is apparent from the face of Henne\u2019s complaint that while some of his alleged injuries are connected to internal employee complaints, Henne asserts his injuries were caused by how Yakima responded to the complaints in its capacity as an employer. That is the basis of the challenged claims. CP at 13 (Henne\u2019s complaint, alleging his damages are \u201c[a]s a direct and proximate result of [Yakima\u2019s] acts\u201d and seeking relief in the form of \u201cenjoining [Yakima] from perpetuating the discrimination, harassment and hostile work environment\u201d created by other employees), 130 (Henne\u2019s response to Yakima\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion: \u201cPlaintiff does not allege that complaints should not be investigated. On the contrary, he is concerned that complaints are not always followed-up in a professional and impartial manner.\u201d).\n\u00b631 It is clear that the actions forming the basis of Henne\u2019s claims do not meet any of the five definitions of \u201caction involving public participation and petition\u201d in RCW 4.24.525(2). Four of the statutory definitions refer to \u201c[a]ny oral statement made, or written statement or other document submitted\u201d in various types of proceedings. RCW 4.24.525(2)(a)-(d). None of Henne\u2019s claims against Yakima can fall within these first four definitions because they are based on Yakima\u2019s conduct, not its statements. The final definition of \u201caction involving public participation and petition\u201d does refer to conduct, but it also does not apply because Yakima\u2019s alleged conduct was not \u201clawful conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with an issue of public concern, or in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition.\u201d RCW 4.24.525(2)(e). Even if Yakima had in fact responded properly to internal complaints, such that Henne\u2019s allegations would ultimately prove meritless, Yakima\u2019s conduct was responsive to, not in furtherance of, protected speech.\n\u00b632 At most, Yakima\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion shows that Henne\u2019s complaint should have been more artfully worded. It cannot be contended that the substantial penalties in the anti-SLAPP statute were intended to prevent mere unartful pleadings. Yakima failed to meet its initial burden of showing Henne brought any SLAPP claims against it.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b633 I agree with the majority that the trial court properly denied Yakima\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. Because I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s analysis, I concur in the result.\nJohnson and Yu, JJ., concur with Fairhurst, J.\nStrategic lawsuit against public participation.\nI agree with the majority that we should reject Yakima\u2019s argument that its employees\u2019 internal complaints should be considered Yakima\u2019s own statements under agency principles.\nWhile Yakima is correct that informally contacting the other party is not a prerequisite to filing an anti-SLAPP motion, it is good practice to ensure that the motion, which carries potentially severe consequences for both the moving and responding parties under ROW 4.24.525(6)(a)-(b), is based on something more substantial than misinterpretations of unartful pleadings.",

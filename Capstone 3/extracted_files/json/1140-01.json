In keeping with the order, the clerk of this court entered a judgment for $2,592, using as his guide the amount shown by the receiver\u2019s report in the record. The judgment rendered in the trial court was not for a specific sum. Our attention has been called to the fact that the judgment was not for a specific amount but for a portion of the assets in the hands of the receiver, and that the receiver\u2019s report appearing in the record was not his final report but, on the contrary, was his first report, which did not show all legal disbursements. In view of this fact it was error to enter a judgment here for a specific sum on the supersedeas bond, but tbe same should have fixed the liability on the bond, and the ease should have been remanded with direction that the amount thereof be ascertained by the trial court \u25a0after allowing* the receiver such amounts as have been paid out >by him on order o'f the trial court.",

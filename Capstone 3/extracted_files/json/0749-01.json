        "text": "[As amended by order of the Supreme Court October 19, 2015.]\nStephens, J.\n\u00b6 1 In 1991, a jury convicted Jonathan Lee Gentry of the aggravated first degree murder of 12-year-old Cassie Holden and sentenced him to death. This court affirmed his conviction in 1995 on direct appeal and twice denied postconviction relief, in 1999 and in 2014. State v. Gentry, 125 Wn.2d 570, 888 P.2d 1105, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 843 (1995); In re Pers. Restraint of Gentry, 137 Wn.2d 378, 972 P.2d 1250 (1999); In re Pers. Restraint of Gentry, 179 Wn.2d 614, 316 P.3d 1020 (2014). In 2011, Gentry filed a motion in Kitsap County Superior Court, seeking postcon-viction DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) testing, which the trial court granted. Among the items to be tested was a bloodstained shoelace that had been introduced into evidence at trial.\n\u00b62 After the DNA report on the shoelace came back matching the victim\u2019s blood profile, the State moved to end further DNA testing. By that time, the judge who granted the original motion had retired, and the case was assigned to Judge Jennifer Forbes. Gentry sent a letter to Judge Forbes indicating she may have a potential conflict of interest. During the motion hearing, Gentry asked Judge Forbes to recuse herself, observing that she had worked in the prosecutor\u2019s office during the time of Gentry\u2019s collateral appeals and that her husband had worked for the local police department during the investigation of the crime. Judge Forbes declined to recuse herself, also denying a subsequent written motion for recusal.\n\u00b63 Judge Forbes granted the State\u2019s motion to deny further DNA testing, ruling that Gentry could not meet the substantive standard of RCW 10.73.170, which requires a convicted person to show the likelihood that DNA evidence would demonstrate innocence on a more probable than not basis. She concluded that the statute does not impose a presumption that further DNA testing will be favorable and exculpatory and held that even with such a presumption, Gentry could not show probable innocence in light of the new inculpatory DNA test on the shoelace. Gentry timely appealed directly to this court.\n\u00b64 We affirm the trial court. Gentry failed to preserve his argument that the trial judge should have treated his recusal request as an affidavit of prejudice. There is no reversible error in the trial judge\u2019s refusal to recuse herself. And, while the judge\u2019s conclusion that RCW 10.73.170 does not impose a favorable presumption of exculpatory DNA test results is clearly wrong in light of our recent decision in State v. Crumpton, 181 Wn.2d 252, 255, 332 P.3d 448 (2014), the ultimate holding denying further DNA testing is sustainable. We find that a trial court may consider new DNA test results in deciding whether to allow further DNA testing. We hold that Judge Forbes acted within her discretion in determining that Gentry could not demonstrate probable innocence in light of the result of the DNA test on the shoelace, even assuming the remaining DNA evidence would be favorable to him.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n1. Background\n\u00b65 In 1991, Gentry was convicted of first degree aggravated murder and sentenced to death for the 1988 murder of Cassie Holden in Kitsap County. This court affirmed his conviction and remanded the case for issuance of a death warrant. Gentry, 125 Wn.2d at 658. The key facts are summarized in this court\u2019s decision on Gentry\u2019s direct appeal:\nIn early June 1988, the 12-year-old victim lived with her father and stepmother in Pocatello, Idaho. On June 11, 1988, she traveled to Kitsap County, Washington, to spend the summer with her mother at her mother\u2019s home near Bremerton. On June 13, 1988, at approximately 4:30 p.m., the young victim went for a walk. She was expected home at 6 p.m. for dinner, but never returned.\nHer body was found early June 15, 1988, behind a large log at the bottom of a path running from a trail through a wooded area adjacent to Rolling Hills Golf Course, near Bremerton, Washington. The victim\u2019s eyeglasses, earring and a bouquet of flowers were found approximately 148 feet up the footpath on and near the main trail.\nThe victim appeared to have been sexually assaulted, as her jeans and underpants were pulled down and her T-shirt and bra pulled up. Her blue sweatshirt had been removed from one arm and pulled up, partially covering her face. She had been struck in the head approximately 8 to 15 times, suffering 10 \u201csignificant\u201d injuries.\nKitsap County sheriff deputies investigated the murder scene and determined that a trail of blood was splattered from the main trail, down the footpath about 148 feet to where the body was found. They found a 2.2-pound rock that had blue fibers crushed into it. The fibers matched the fibers in the victim\u2019s sweatshirt. The rock also had red spots on it that appeared to be blood. The rock was believed to be the murder weapon.\nThe autopsy showed that the victim had been killed by one of the blows to her head. The results of the autopsy could not show the order in which the blows were received or which blow actually killed the victim. The autopsy did not conclusively show that the young victim had been raped.\nDuring the autopsy several loose hairs were removed from the victim\u2019s body. An examination of the hairs showed that most of them were consistent with the victim\u2019s own hairs. Two of the hair fragments were recovered from her T-shirt and were Negroid hairs. A coarse brown hair, believed to be a pubic hair from a Caucasian, was found on the victim\u2019s left thigh and a red pigmented hair was found on one of her shoes. The Negroid hair was later determined to be genetically consistent with the Defendant\u2019s brother\u2019s arm hair. Defendant\u2019s brother was not in Kitsap County at the time of the murder. Evidence was produced to show that the Defendant, who lived with his brother\u2019s family, wore his brother\u2019s clothes on occasion. There was no identification connected with the Caucasian hair.\nThe investigation eventually focused on the Defendant. A search of his residence was conducted and clothing samples, including a pair of shoes, were seized. Examination of the shoes indicated that blood had been wiped from the shoes. Spots of blood were found on the shoelaces and those bloodstains were the subject of a number of scientific tests. These [tests matched the blood to Holden\u2019s type; 0.18% percent of the population would have had this type of blood], . . . [T]esting was also conducted on a hair found in the victim\u2019s T-shirt, which yielded a [blood type that] is not the same as the Defendant\u2019s type, but does match his brother\u2019s type.\nOther evidence linking Defendant to the murder included the testimony of three persons who reported seeing a man matching Defendant\u2019s description near the place of the murder and around the time of the murder, and three former jail mates of the Defendant who testified that the Defendant admitted to them he had killed someone.\nId. at 579-81. This court rejected two subsequent personal restraint petitions.\n2. Facts Relating to Postconviction DNA Test\n\u00b66 On February 3, 2011, Gentry filed a motion for postconviction DNA testing. Gentry argued that DNA testing has advanced since the time of his trial and now allows for more accurate testing as well as testing of items that were previously difficult or impossible to test. Gentry requested (1) comparative DNA testing of hairs found on Holden\u2019s body, T-shirt, and thigh with members of Holden\u2019s and Gentry\u2019s families and other African-Americans and (2) testing of the blood found on Gentry\u2019s shoes and shoelaces. Gentry argued that if the DNA of one of the hairs belonged to someone other than himself or to an individual with no legitimate reason to be in close contact with Holden, there may exist a new basis to doubt his guilt. And if the DNA of the untested blood belonged to someone other than Holden, questions may exist about the evidence on which the prosecution relied.\n\u00b67 The State did not object to Gentry\u2019s motion but reserved the right to later object to the relevance and admissibility of the results. On July 25, 2011, the court granted the motion. The court ordered about 58 items to be subject to DNA testing pursuant to RCW 10.73.170 (DNA testing requests) by the Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory (crime lab).\n\u00b68 On September 7, 2011, the crime lab sent the court a preliminary letter indicating its ability to perform the testing. The crime lab said it had the capacity to perform the DNA testing but indicated that the items most likely to yield probative DNA test results are those that had been previously examined during the original trial. It therefore recommended obtaining the DNA extracts held by Forensic Science Associates, run by Edward Blake. Blake declined to provide Gentry the DNA extracts for testing because he argued it was his work product. According to Gentry, the prosecutor never attempted to obtain the DNA extracts for testing despite Blake\u2019s indication that he would return them upon request by the prosecutor.\n\u00b69 On May 18, 2012, the court granted Gentry\u2019s motion to release the left shoelace to a defense expert to conduct microscopic examinations. The expert issued a report raising concerns about the handling of the shoelaces during their initial testing and concluding that the characteristics of the bloodstains \u201clack the necessary features for concluding that they were the result of blood spatter.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 573.\n\u00b610 On July 16, 2013, the crime lab completed DNA testing of the shoelace and submitted a copy of its results to the court. The crime lab found that the DNA profile obtained from the bloodstains on the shoelace matched the DNA profile of Holden. It reported that \u201c[t]he estimated probability of selecting an unrelated individual at random from the U.S. population with a matching profile is 1 in 110 trillion.\u201d CP at 520.\n\u00b611 On the same day, the State filed a motion to deny further postconviction DNA testing in light of the initial DNA test results. The State argued that under State v. Riofta, 166 Wn.2d 358, 209 P.3d 467 (2009), postconviction DNA testing is permitted only when the \u201c \u2018exculpatory results would, in combination with the other evidence, raise a reasonable probability the petitioner was not the perpetrator.\u2019 \u201d CP at 506 (quoting Riofta, 166 Wn.2d at 367-68). Thus, the State said, the \u201codds are 1 in 110 trillion that the blood on Gentry\u2019s shoe was Cassie Holden\u2019s. There is now no possibility that the State has convicted the wrong man.\u201d CP at 507. Gentry opposed the motion, arguing that numerous additional items remain untested and that the defense expert raised questions about the integrity of the handling of the shoelaces.\n\u00b612 On October 28, 2013, the court entered a written order granting the State\u2019s motion to deny further postcon-viction DNA testing.\n3. Facts Relating to Recusal Request\n\u00b613 On July 18, 2013, the State filed a note for the motion docket setting the motion to deny further postconviction DNA testing for a hearing on September 20, 2013. The note indicated that the matter would be set before Judge Forbes. Four days before the hearing, Gentry sent a letter to Judge Forbes, which stated, in relevant part:\nI understand that this case has recently been assigned to you for a hearing on a State\u2019s Motion now set for September 20, 2013. This is a capital case that was being actively litigated by the Kitsap County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office from 1996 to 1999, a period during which I understand you were a Deputy Prosecuting Attorney in that office. I have not seen any indication that you were directly involved in the case, but it was and is a prominent one and involves claims (still pending in the courts)[] of prosecutorial misconduct.\nBecause that appears to create a conflict and obviously implicates the appearance of fairness, I felt I should alert you to this prior to filing any motion for reassignment.\nSuppl. CP at 695.\n\u00b614 At the hearing, Judge Forbes responded to Gentry\u2019s letter and declined to recuse herself:\nWell, as I indicated before, I hear a number of cases out of the prosecutor\u2019s office on a daily basis involving people that I have worked with who are the prosecutors.\nI guess if you have a little more information about who it would be that might have the finger pointed at them, I might rethink my position on that. But I don\u2019t feel that my hearing this case on that issue presents an appearance-of-fairness question.\nI also worked as a criminal defense attorney. I have handled matters as a defense attorney against this prosecutor\u2019s office. I have, you know, actively litigated cases against the prosecution. I was a member of [Washington Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers]. I have a more varied background than just being a prosecutor. And I haven\u2019t worked in the prosecutor\u2019s office since 2006.1 wasn\u2019t in the criminal division since 2002,1 believe. So it\u2019s been a while. And so at this point, I feel comfortable and I\u2019m distant enough. I had no contact with this case when I was in the prosecutor\u2019s office. I think I saw the name on a box on a shelf, maybe at best, would be the most contact I had.\nI know nothing about this case. I don\u2019t really even know the fact pattern about this case. I had no involvement in this case when I was in the prosecutor\u2019s office. I recall no discussions about this case when I was in the prosecutor\u2019s office.\nI don\u2019t know [former trial prosecutor] Irene Asai ... [or former prosecutor] Danny Clem. ... I have met [former trial prosecutor Brian] Moran. I worked with him for a little while, but I never worked a case with him. He was always in a different division.\nAt this point, there\u2019s nothing presented that makes me concerned about my ability to proceed on this case at this time, but I\u2019m happy to revisit that if you want to comb through your files a little bit and present information to me. If it is somebody that I knew and I feel that I have a predisposition to believe one way or another about who they are as a person and that is an issue of substance in this case, I would agree and I would remove myself from the case, but I don\u2019t have that in front of me.\nVerbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (No. 89620-8) (Sept. 20, 2013) at 5-6, 8.\n\u00b615 Judge Forbes also indicated that her husband was a Bremerton police officer during the time of the investigation:\nHe was not actively involved in this case. He worked for the Bremerton Police Department at the time.... [H]e indicated to me that he . . . worked as a backup to the sheriff\u2019s office on crime scene containment, wrote no reports, to his recollection, and did not testify, was not a person who was actively involved in this case. In my opinion, that doesn\u2019t create an issue for me because he was not involved and I do not believe he will be a witness in the case.\nId. at 6.\n\u00b616 Judge Forbes declined to recuse herself but indicated she would reconsider her decision if Gentry provided more information. Id. at 9. She then proceeded to the merits of the State\u2019s motion to deny further postconviction DNA testing.\n\u00b617 After the hearing, Gentry filed a written motion to recuse Judge Forbes. The motion did not allege any new facts regarding Judge Forbes\u2019s or her husband\u2019s participation in or knowledge of Gentry\u2019s case. Judge Forbes entered a written order denying Gentry\u2019s motion. She said, \u201cThe arguments presented in this motion are substantially similar to those made orally on September 20,2013\u201d and treated Gentry\u2019s motion as a motion for reconsideration. CP at 671.\n\u00b618 Gentry timely appealed to this court.\nANALYSIS\n1. Gentry Failed To Preserve His Claim That Judge Forbes Should Have Treated His Request To Recuse as an Affidavit of Prejudice under RCW 4.12.040\n\u00b619 A party has the right to disqualify a trial judge for prejudice, without substantiating the claim of prejudice, if the statutory requirements of RCW 4.12.050(1) are met. State v. Chamberlin, 161 Wn.2d 30, 41, 162 P.3d 389 (2007). RCW 4.12.040(1) states, \u201cNo judge of a superior court . . . shall sit to hear or try any action or proceeding when it shall be established ... that said judge is prejudiced against any party or attorney.\u201d In order to establish prejudice, a party must file a motion supported by an affidavit indicating that the party \u201ccannot\u201d or \u201cbelieves\u201d that it cannot \u201chave a fair and impartial trial before such judge.\u201d RCW 4.12.050(1).\n\u00b620 Gentry argues he was entitled to a different judge upon request under RCW 4.12.040 and the court, therefore, had no discretion to deny his motion. Gentry contends that the court erred in failing to treat his letter and motion as an affidavit of prejudice, which requires automatic recusal under RCW 4.12.040(1) and .050(1).\n\u00b621 The State counters that Gentry failed to preserve this claim of error, and we agree. At no point to the trial court did Gentry suggest he was bringing an affidavit of prejudice. Gentry did not even hint that the trial judge was obligated to recuse under RCW 4.12.040(1), either in his initial letter, during the hearing, or in his subsequent written motion for recusal. The general rule is that appellate courts will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. State v. Kirkman, 159 Wn.2d 918, 926, 155 P.3d 125 (2007). A limited exception is that a claim of error may be raised for the first time on appeal if it is a manifest error affecting a constitutional right. Id.; RAP 2.5(a)(3). This is not such a case. The right to peremptory removal of a judge without substantiating a claim of actual prejudice is not of constitutional dimension, but statutory, flowing from RCW 4.12.040. See In re Welfare of McGee, 36 Wn. App. 660, 661, 679 P.2d 933 (1984); In re Marriage of Lemon, 59 Wn. App. 568, 572, 799 P.2d 748 (1990), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 118 Wn.2d 422, 823 P.2d 1100 (1992).\n\u00b622 Though Gentry now faults the trial judge for not sua sponte treating his recusal request as an affidavit of prejudice, his actions in the trial court did not apprise the judge that he was seeking her removal before she made the discretionary decision before her. His recusal request was not equivalent to an affidavit of prejudice. RCW 4.12.050(1) requires a showing by motion, supported by an affidavit, that a party cannot or believes he cannot have a fair and impartial trial. While Gentry is correct that courts do not read this requirement in a hypertechnical way, the cases on which he relies involve motions that met the statute in substance. See Garvey v. Skamser, 69 Wash. 259, 124 P. 688 (1912) (finding sufficient an affidavit that indicated a party believes the judge to be prejudiced); State v. Ryncarz, 64 Wn. App. 902, 903, 826 P.2d 1101 (1992) (finding that \u201cform should not prevail over substance\u201d when a clerk or judge could have easily remedied defendant\u2019s failure to notarize his affidavit of prejudice).\n\u00b623 Gentry\u2019s recusal request, in contrast, focused on the appearance of fairness and strongly suggested the judge should recuse as a discretionary matter. See Suppl. CP at 695 (letter from Gentry\u2019s counsel stating, \u201cI have not seen any indication you were directly involved in the case, but it was and is a prominent one. . . . Because that appears to create a conflict and obviously implicates the appearance of fairness, I felt I should alert you to this\u201d); VRP (No. 89620-8) (Sept. 20, 2013) at 5 (Gentry\u2019s counsel stated during the hearing, \u201c[I]t has nothing to do with Your Honor personally, but it does have to do, I think, with the professional association and the appearance of fairness.\u201d).\n\u00b624 We hold that Gentry failed to preserve his claim of error that the trial judge was required to recuse under RCW 4.12.040(1).\n2. The Trial Judge Did Not Abuse Her Discretion in Declining To Recuse\n\u00b625 As an alternative to his argument under RCW 4.12.040(1), Gentry argues that Judge Forbes abused her discretion. See State v. Davis, 175 Wn.2d 287, 308, 290 P.3d 43 (2012) (recusal decision reviewed for abuse of discretion). An abuse of discretion is found when a trial judge\u2019s decision is \u201c \u2018manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons.\u2019 \u201d Wilson v. Horsley, 137 Wn.2d 500, 505, 974 P.2d 316 (1999) (quoting State ex rel. Carroll v. Junker, 79 Wn.2d 12, 26, 482 P.2d 775 (1971)).\n\u00b626 The apperance of fairness doctrine provides that \u201cjudges should disqualify themselves in a proceeding in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Sherman v. State, 128 Wn.2d 164, 188, 905 P.2d 355 (1995) (citing former Code of Judicial Conduct (CJC) Canon 3 (Q). In determining whether recusal is warranted, actual prejudice is not the standard. \u201c[A] mere suspicion of partiality\u201d may be enough to warrant recusal because \u201cthe effect on the public\u2019s confidence in our judicial system can be debilitating.\u201d Id. at 205. The test for determining whether a judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned is an objective test that assumes that \u201c \u2018a reasonable person knows and understands all the relevant facts.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 206 (quoting In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., 861 F.2d 1307, 1313 (2d Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1102 (1989)). A specific CJC canon describes disqualification for former government employees. CJC Canon 2.11(A)(6)(a), (b). Judges who are former government employees should disqualify themselves when they \u201cserved in governmental employment, and in such capacity participated personally and substantially as a public official concerning the proceeding.\u201d CJC Canon 2.11(A)(6)(b).\n\u00b627 Gentry argues that the appearance of fairness doctrine requires recusal by the trial judge because she worked as a prosecutor while Gentry\u2019s collateral appeals were pending, and because her husband worked for the Brem-erton Police Department during the investigation. However, the trial judge indicated she had no involvement in the case during the trial or appellate proceedings, and she has not been employed in the criminal division of the prosecutor\u2019s office since 2002. VRP (No. 89620-8) (Sept. 20, 2013) at 6. Her husband worked as a backup to the sheriff\u2019s office during the investigation and helped contain the crime scene but wrote no reports, did not testify in the case, and is now retired from the police force. Id. Besides highlighting the trial judge\u2019s prior affiliation with the prosecutor\u2019s office and her husband\u2019s work, Gentry provides no further evidence to suggest that the trial judge had any involvement in the prior proceedings or interest in the outcome of the hearing. Gentry thus fails to establish a violation of the appearance of fairness doctrine. Gentry further fails to establish that the judge had any personal or substantial involvement as a public official in the proceeding that warrants disqualification under CJC Canon 2.11(A)(6)(b).\n\u00b628 The cases cited by Gentry involve judges who should have recused themselves because of their direct involvement in cases. Gentry cites no authority supporting his argument that judges should recuse themselves merely because of their associations when they had no involvement in the case. The trial judge\u2019s decision not to recuse herself w as not \u201c \u2018manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons.\u2019 \u201d Wilson, 137 Wn.2d at 505 (quoting Carroll, 79 Wn.2d at 26). The trial judge indicated during the hearing that she would have been happy to reconsider her decision if Gentry would have provided additional information. However, Gentry\u2019s written motion to recuse did not incorporate any new facts that would put in question the trial judge\u2019s impartiality or appearance of impartiality. For these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining Gentry\u2019s request for recusal.\n3. The Trial Court Erred in Concluding That RCW 10.73-.170 Does Not Require a Presumption That DNA Testing Will Be Favorable to the Convicted Person\n\u00b629 We now turn to the issues presented by the State\u2019s motion to end further postconviction DNA testing. Gentry has two main objections: one relating to the standard the trial court applied and a second objecting to the trial court\u2019s consideration of new DNA test results as a basis to cut off further DNA testing.\n\u00b630 RCW 10.73.170 allows a person convicted of a felony currently serving a term of imprisonment to file a motion requesting DNA testing. The statute includes both procedural and substantive components. The State concedes that Gentry met his procedural burden, so these requirements will not be discussed further. At issue before us is the substantive portion of the statute, which requires the convicted person to show \u201cthe likelihood that the DNA evidence would demonstrate innocence on a more probable than not basis.\u201d RCW 10.73.170(3). The trial court found that Gentry could not meet this standard and therefore was not entitled to further DNA testing. CP at 676 (Conclusion of Law V).\n\u00b631 We review a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for postconviction DNA testing for abuse of discretion. Riofta, 166 Wn.2d at 370. A trial court abuses its direction if its decision rested on facts unsupported in the record or was reached by applying the wrong legal standard. State v. Rafay, 167 Wn.2d 644, 655, 222 P.3d 86 (2009).\n\u00b632 The trial court concluded Gentry \u201cfailed to show a \u2018reasonable probability of his innocence\u2019 \u201d in light of the inculpatory DNA test results. CP at 676 (Conclusion of Law V (quoting RCW 10.73.170(3))). The court rejected Gentry\u2019s claim that the statute presumes further DNA testing would be favorable and exculpatory, entering the following conclusion of law:\nThat any claim that the Court must presume that further DNA testing would be both favorable and exculpatory, is essentially the same argument that was put forth by the dissenting justices in Riofta [, 166 Wn.2d at 376 (C. Johnson, J., dissenting)]. The majority opinion in Riofta, however, rejected this view and held that \u201cRCW 10.73.170(3) asks a defendant to show a reasonable probability of his innocence before requiring State resources to be expended on a test.\u201d\nId. at 676 (Conclusion of Law VI) (quoting Riofta, 166 Wn.2d at 369-70).\n\u00b633 This court recently held in Crumpton, 181 Wn.2d at 255, that under RCW 10.73.170(3) \u201ca court should presume DNA evidence would be favorable to the convicted individual when determining if it is likely the evidence would prove his or her innocence.\u201d Neither of the parties discuss Crumpton because it was decided after they submitted their briefs. Gentry submitted a statement of additional authority in light of Crumpton, supporting his argument that the trial court applied the incorrect standard in granting the State\u2019s motion. The State did not submit its own statement of additional authority.\n\u00b634 In light of this court\u2019s decision in Crumpton, the trial court erred in relying on its reading of Riofta to reject a favorable presumption. See CP at 676 (Conclusion of Law VI). Crumpton provides that \u201ca court should evaluate the likelihood of innocence based on a favorable test result,\u201d not whether a single piece of evidence is strong or weak. 181 Wn.2d at 262. We therefore find that insofar as the trial court applied the wrong legal standard, it abused its discretion.\n4. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying Further DNA Testing\n\u00b635 The trial court\u2019s erroneous conclusion that RCW 10.73.170 does not require a favorable presumption resulted in no reversible error. The trial court alternatively held that \u201ceven if the Court were to apply the standard rejected in Conclusion [of Law VI], in light of the results of the testing of the shoelace, Gentry would still be unable to meet the \u2018onerous\u2019 substantive standard of Subsection (3).\u201d CP at 676-77 (Conclusion of Law VII). Thus, the court\u2019s decision ultimately rests on the correct legal standard.\n\u00b636 The key question, then, concerns whether it is proper for a trial court to consider \u201cnewly discovered\u201d postconviction DNA evidence alongside the trial evidence and the presumably favorable untested DNA evidence. The statute is silent on this issue, and our cases to date have not presented this situation. In past cases, we have been faced only with circumstances where a court considers probable innocence in light of the trial evidence and presumably favorable untested DNA evidence. See Riofta, 166 Wn.2d at 358; State v. Thompson, 173 Wn.2d 865, 271 P.3d 204 (2012); Crumpton, 181 Wn.2d at 265. While Riofta said that courts must view \u201call of the evidence presented at trial or newly discovered, favorable DNA test results,\u201d 166 Wn.2d at 367 (emphasis added), it did not involve the issue here: whether a court can or should consider new DNA test results as they come in when determining whether to allow further testing. Or must a court ignore any new results and consider only the evidence admitted during trial and presumably favorable DNA test results?\n\u00b637 Gentry argues that allowing consideration of new DNA evidence before all the testing is completed results in de novo review of a granted order under RCW 10.73.170. Gentry says such a rule would defeat the purpose of RCW 10.73.170 by making DNA testing orders subject to constant reconsideration and revision. However, Gentry does not cite any authority for the proposition that a court cannot modify a previous order when new evidence is discovered and a party moves for relief. Further, RCW 10.73.170 contains no language prohibiting a trial court from modifying an order granting postconviction DNA testing.\n\u00b638 We interpret RCW 10.73.170 in a way that balances the interests of fairness and finality. DNA testing of multiple items will almost always result in evidence coming in piece by piece, and it does not seem unreasonable to test the most significant items first to see whether further testing is necessary.\n\u00b639 We conclude that trial judges do have the discretion to consider all relevant evidence in deciding a question under RCW 10.73.170. Such a rule is fair to both parties and supports finality. We find nothing in the statutory scheme that prohibits a trial court from cutting off further testing once it has new evidence that makes it impossible for a convicted person to meet the statutory burden of showing \u201cthe likelihood that the DNA evidence would demonstrate innocence on a more probable than not basis.\u201d RCW 10.73.170(3).\n\u00b640 The issue remains as to whether Judge Forbes abused her discretion in concluding that even with a favorable presumption as to the yet untested DNA evidence, Gentry cannot show a reasonable probability that he is innocent. This inquiry requires considering the evidence at trial, the results of the new DNA test from the left shoelace, and the favorable presumption that the remaining DNA testing would exculpate Gentry.\n\u00b641 The evidence at trial establishing Gentry\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt included DNA testing of blood found on the shoelaces seized from Gentry\u2019s home, which did not eliminate the victim, Cassie Holden, as the source of the blood. Our decision upholding Gentry\u2019s conviction noted that the bloodstained shoes and laces were a key piece of inculpatory evidence. See Gentry, 125 Wn.2d at 580-81, 604. The recent DNA test of the left shoelace confirmed the presence of the victim\u2019s blood to a high degree of certainty. CP at 520. Remaining evidence to be tested includes bloodstains on Gentry\u2019s shoes and hairs found on Holden\u2019s body. See CP at 487-91 (listing the items that are subject to DNA testing).\n\u00b642 It seems unlikely that further testing of the hairs will aid Gentry\u2019s actual innocence claim. Even assuming the further testing shows the hairs did not belong to Gentry, evidence at trial showed that many sources could have deposited the hairs. VRP (No. 58415-0) (May 17, 1991) at 209 (testimony that on the day of the murder, at least one African-American child was playing at the victim\u2019s home); 208 (testimony that on the day of the murder, the victim spoke with a young girl who was being supervised by an African-American babysitter); VRP (No. 58415-0) (May 15, 1991) at 3820, 2826 (testimony that the victim\u2019s brother sometimes played with three African-American friends). However, the presence of another person\u2019s hair on Holden\u2019s body does not mean that Gentry is innocent. See Riofta, 166 Wn.2d at 370-71 (noting that the presence of another person\u2019s DNA evidence on a hat found at the crime scene is not evidence that someone other than the defendant committed the crime).\n\u00b643 Further testing of the blood found on the shoes presents a closer question, however. Assuming such testing is favorable to Gentry requires assuming the results do not identify Cassie Holden as the source of the blood. Thus, the court would have blood evidence on the left shoelace that matches Holden\u2019s DNA profile to a high degree of certainty alongside blood evidence on the shoes that does not match. The question is whether this evidence, considered in conjunction with the trial evidence and the further \u201cevidence\u201d that the DNA hair test results do not match Gentry\u2019s DNA profile, demonstrates Gentry\u2019s innocence on a more probable than not basis. More precisely, the question is whether the trial court abused its discretion in concluding it does not. While reasonable judges could disagree and some might allow further testing of at least the remaining blood evidence, Judge Forbes\u2019s decision falls within the range of acceptable decisions and was not an abuse of discretion under ROW 10.73.170.\n\u00b644 While the trial court embraced an incorrect legal standard contrary to our holding in Crumpton, the order denying further DNA testing alternatively rested on application of the correct legal standard. We read RCW 10.73.170 as allowing trial courts to consider all evidence, including newly discovered DNA test results, when considering a motion to deny further DNA testing, and conclude that the trial judge here acted within her sound discretion.\nAfter modification, further review denied October 21, 2015.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b645 We affirm the trial court. Gentry\u2019s request that Judge Forbes recuse herself was not an affidavit of prejudice, and the judge did not abuse her discretion in declining to recuse. The trial judge also acted within her discretion in granting the State\u2019s motion to deny further DNA testing. Though the court recited an incorrect legal standard, the order also rested on application of the correct standard and the sustainable conclusion that further DNA testing would not demonstrate Gentry\u2019s innocence on a more probable than not basis.\nMadsen, C.J.; Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Wiggins, and Yu, JJ.; and Johanson and Maxa, JJ. Pro Tem., concur.\nOral arguments for In re Personal Restraint of Gentry, 179 Wn.2d 614, were held on June 25, 2013, a few weeks before this letter was written.\nAs a preliminary matter, Gentry argues that the State\u2019s motion was essentially a motion for reconsideration, subject to Kitsap County Local Civil Rule 59 (new trial, reconsideration, and amendment of judgments). This local rule requires motions for reconsideration be filed within 10 days of entry of an order, in which case, if the rule applied here, the State\u2019s motion would be time barred. However, the State\u2019s motion was not a motion for reconsideration because it was based on the result of new DNA testing and could probably be regarded as falling under CrR 7.8(b)(2), which authorizes the trial court to relieve a party from a final order when new evidence is discovered. The State\u2019s motion was as timely as it could have been, as it was filed on the same day the crime lab released its results.\nThe trial court\u2019s conclusions of law are misnumbered after the first conclusion of law V. The second conclusion of law \u201cIV,\u201d CP at 676, should be numbered \u201c[VI],\u201d and the second conclusion of law \u201cV\u201d should be numbered \u201c[VII] .\u2019\u2019This opinion will reference the conclusions of law as they should have been numbered.",

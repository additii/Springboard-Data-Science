        "text": "Fairhurst, J.\n\u00b6 1 T.A.W. is an \u201cIndian child\u201d under the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1963, as well as the Washington State Indian Child Welfare Act (WICWA), chapter 13.38 RCW. T.A.W.\u2019s biological father, C.W., is non-Indian, and T.A.W.\u2019s mother, C.B., is Indian and an enrolled member of the Shoalwater Bay Tribe. C.B. and T.A.W.\u2019s stepfather, R.B., successfully petitioned the trial court to terminate C.W.\u2019s parental rights and to allow R.B. to adopt T.A.W. In reaching its decision, the trial court found that ICWA applied to the termination proceedings and that ICWA\u2019s requirements were met beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court did not require C.B. and R.B. to prove that active efforts were undertaken to remedy C.W.\u2019s parental deficiencies prior to terminating his parental rights and made no finding to that effect. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding (1) ICWA and WICWA protect non-Indian and Indian parents alike, (2) the trial court erred by not making an active efforts finding, (3) the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl,_U.S._, 133 S. Ct. 2552, 2557, 186 L. Ed. 2d 729 (2013), was factually distinguishable, and (4) WICWA has no abandonment exception. In re Adoption of TAW., 188 Wn. App. 799, 354 P.3d 46 (2015), review granted, 184 Wn.2d 1040 (2016). C.B. and R.B. appealed. We now affirm the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court so that it may reconsider the termination petition in light of these holdings.\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nA. Factual background\n\u00b62 In December 2007, when T.A.W. was born, C.B. and C.W. were married and living together. C.W. was present at T.A.W.\u2019s birth and signed the paternity affidavit confirming that he is T.A.W.\u2019s father. Though the parties dispute the exact duration, C.W., C.B., and T.A.W. resided together between four months to one year following T.A.W.\u2019s birth. At some point during this period, the parties shared a home on the Shoalwater Bay Tribe reservation. C.W. and C.B. dispute how much of the parenting responsibilities C.W. contributed, but C.W. testified that he cared for T.A.W. while C.B. worked. C.B. eventually asked C.W. to leave the family home because of C.W.\u2019s addiction to methamphetamine.\n\u00b63 After C.W. left, he continued to abuse methamphetamine. C.W. voluntarily enrolled in inpatient drug treatment in 2009 but was unable to maintain his sobriety.\n\u00b64 C.B. filed for dissolution of marriage in April 2009 following an incident where C.W. attempted to take T.A.W. from C.B.\u2019s home. When C.B. refused permission, C.W. punched a wall in C.B.\u2019s home while T.A.W. was present. As part of the dissolution proceedings, the court granted C.B. a temporary restraining order (TRO) that prevented C.W. from contacting her. The TRO permitted only supervised visits between C.W. and T.A.W. until C.W. completed drug treatment. However, C.W. did not attempt to visit T.A.W. during the dissolution proceedings.\n\u00b65 Following the dissolution, C.B.\u2019s mother drove C.B. and T.A.W. to C.W.\u2019s mother\u2019s house for visitations on at least two occasions. Aside from those two occurrences, C.B.\u2019s mother claimed she was unable to facilitate any additional visitations because C.W. no longer resided in the area. C.W. testified that his drug addiction prevented him from maintaining his visitations with T.A.W.\n\u00b66 In July 2009, law enforcement arrested C.W. for violating the TRO after C.W. went to C.B.\u2019s house to reconcile and attempted to enter the premises without permission. Following that incident, the court granted C.B.\u2019s petition to cease all of C.W.\u2019s visitations with T.A.W. pending C.W.\u2019s completion of drug treatment.\n\u00b67 In September 2009, the court entered a final parenting plan that permitted supervised visitation between C.W. and T.A.W. Nevertheless, with the exception of two short releases in 2010 and 2012, C.W. has spent the majority of the past seven years in prison. C.W. last saw T.A.W. before he went to prison near the end of 2009.\n\u00b68 After C.W.\u2019s release in 2012, C.B. obtained a domestic violence protection order from the Shoalwater Bay Tribal Court. In October of that year, the Shoalwater Bay Tribal Court modified the protection order to permit C.W. to petition for rehearing if he completed at least six months of domestic violence perpetrator classes. During the same period, C.B. petitioned the superior court for modification of the parenting plan based on C.W.\u2019s recent release from prison, allegations of C.W.\u2019s suspected involvement in an unsolved murder, and the fact that the protection order was still in place preventing C.W. from contacting C.B. Based on these assertions, the court modified the parenting plan. As modified, the parenting plan prohibited all visitations between C.W. and T.A.W.\n\u00b69 In April 2013, C.W. was sentenced to another 43 months in prison with an expected release date in September 2015. C.W. remained incarcerated during the termination trial.\nB. Procedural history\n\u00b610 In June 2013, C.B. married R.B. C.B. and R.B. filed a petition for termination of parental rights and adoption later that month, which C.W. answered pro se. R.B. and C.B. obtained a court ordered home study pursuant to RCW 26.33.200. The placement evaluator visited R.B. and C.B.\u2019s home, viewed their interactions with T.A.W., performed a criminal background check on R.B., and spoke to R.B.\u2019s references. The placement report recommended that the court terminate C.W.\u2019s parental rights and permit R.B. to adopt T.A.W.\n\u00b611 The termination trial was held in March 2014 in Pacific County Superior Court. The trial court found that T.A.W. was an Indian child and that ICWA applied to the proceedings. The trial court also found beyond a reasonable doubt that the elements of ICWA were met. The trial court then found by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that C.W. abandoned T.A.W. and granted R.B. and C.B.\u2019s termination and adoption petition. C.W. appealed the trial court\u2019s orders.\n\u00b612 The Court of Appeals granted accelerated review under RAP 18.13A. Id. at 799. On appeal, C.W. invoked for the first time the protections of ICWA and WICWA and argued that R.B. and C.B. failed to provide him with active efforts to remedy his parental deficiencies before the trial court terminated his parental rights. R.B. and C.B. asserted that in light of Adoptive Couple, 133 S. Ct. at 2557, ICWA and WICWA did not apply to parents who abandoned their children. R.B. and C.B. alternatively argued that ICWA and WICWA do not operate to protect the rights of non-Indian parents like C.W.\n\u00b613 Division Two of the Court of Appeals unanimously held that both 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d) of ICWA and RCW 13.38.130(1) of WICWA should have applied to the termination trial. T.A.W., 188 Wn. App. at 810. The Court of Appeals considered the plain language of the active efforts provisions of ICWA and WICWA and the underlying policy of each statutory scheme. Id. at 808-12. The court reasoned that those provisions require the petitioning party to prove, prior to the termination of parental rights, that active efforts have been made to remedy the parental deficiencies justifying the termination and that the efforts have proved to be unsuccessful. Id. at 806-07. The Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of the trial court, holding instead that ICWA and WICWA apply in all cases where (1) an Indian child (2) is involved in a child custody proceeding, without regard for the Indian status of the parents. Id. at 810. This conclusion was based partially on language found in other dependency and adoption statutes indicating that if an Indian child is involved, ICWA shall apply. Id. Finally, the Court of Appeals held it was not bound by the ruling in Adoptive Couple because that case was factually dissimilar and because WICWA does not contain the abandonment exception that the Supreme Court recognized as existing in ICWA. Id. at 815-16.\n\u00b614 R.B. and C.B. appealed the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling. Our Supreme Court commissioner granted discretionary review.\nII. ISSUES\n\u00b6 15 A. Does ICWA or WICWA apply to the termination of parental rights of a non-Indian biological parent?\n\u00b616 B. Does ICWA or WICWA apply to stepparent adoptions?\n\u00b617 C. Do ICWA\u2019s or WICWA\u2019s active efforts provisions apply to privately initiated terminations when the child will remain with the Indian parent?\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. ICWA and WICWA apply to the termination of parental rights of a non-Indian biological father\n\u00b618 As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the protections of ICWA or WICWA apply to C.W., T.A.W.\u2019s non-Indian biological father. The Court of Appeals held that neither act conditioned applicability on a parent\u2019s Indian status. Id. at 810. R.B. and C.B. advance that because C.W. is non-Indian and because, in their view, the divorce between C.B. and C.W. broke up the Indian family, ICWA and WICWA do not apply to the termination proceedings. Specifically, R.B. and C.B. argue that the Court of Appeals erroneously interpreted the acts and, as a result, mistakenly placed a burden on them to prove they had provided active efforts to C.W. before his rights were terminated. R.B. and C.B.\u2019s position ignores the express dictates of ICWA and WICWA. We hold that the plain language of ICWA and WICWA apply to and protect the parental rights of a non-Indian parent of an Indian child.\n1. Standard of review\n\u00b619 The active efforts provisions and the abandonment exception to ICWA need be considered only if either ICWA or WICWA applies to the present case. Accordingly, the primary question we must answer is whether ICWA or WICWA applies to the termination of a non-Indian\u2019s parental rights.\n\u00b620 Statutory interpretation is a question of law that we review de novo. State v. Sanchez, 177 Wn.2d 835, 842, 306 P.3d 935 (2013) (citing Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 9, 43 P.3d 4 (2002)). The purpose of our inquiry is to determine legislative intent and interpret the statutory provisions to carry out its intent. Id.\n\u00b621 Within our statutory interpretation process, we first consider the statute\u2019s plain language. State v. Armendariz, 160 Wn.2d 106, 110, 156 P.3d 201 (2007) (citing State v. J.P., 149 Wn.2d 444, 450, 69 P.3d 318 (2003)). \u201cIf the plain language is subject to only one interpretation, our inquiry ends because plain language does not require construction.\u201d HomeStreet, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 166 Wn.2d 444, 451, 210 P.3d 297 (2009) (citing Armendariz, 160 Wn.2d at 110; State v. Thornton, 119 Wn.2d 578, 580, 835 P.2d 216 (1992)). If the statutory language is both plain and unambiguous, the meaning we give the statute must be derived from the statutory language itself. Id. (citing Wash. State Human Rights Comm\u2019n v. Cheney Sch. Dist. No. 30, 97 Wn.2d 118, 121, 641 P.2d 163 (1982)). To ascertain the statute\u2019s plain meaning, we may examine (1) the entirety of the statute in which the disputed provision is found, (2) related statutes, or (3) other provisions within the same act. Campbell & Gwinn, 146 Wn.2d at 10. If the statute at issue, or a related statute, incorporates a relevant statement of purpose, our reading of the statute should be consistent with that purpose. See Nationscapital Mortg. Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Fin. Insts., 133 Wn. App. 723, 736, 137 P.3d 78 (2006).\n\u00b622 Like statutory interpretation, whether ICWA and WICWA apply is a question of law that we also review de novo. In re Custody of C.C.M., 149 Wn. App. 184, 194, 202 P.3d 971 (2009) (citing In re Dependency of A.L.W., 108 Wn. App. 664, 669, 32 P.3d 297 (2001)).\n\u00b623 As we have in the past, we recognize that \u201c \u2018courts undertake a grave responsibility when they deprive parents of the care, custody and control of their natural children.\u2019 \u201d In re Pawling, 101 Wn.2d 392, 399, 679 P.2d 916 (1984) (quoting In re Welfare of Sego, 82 Wn.2d 736, 738, 513 P.2d 831 (1973)). A parent\u2019s right to the care, custody, and control of his child \u201cis perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized.\u201d Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 147 L. Ed. 2d 49 (2000) (plurality opinion); see also In re Welfare of Sumey, 94 Wn.2d 757, 762, 621 P.2d 108 (1980). When an Indian child is at issue, ICWA and WICWA impose more exacting requirements than a typical termination proceeding. Because understanding the context in which the contested provisions are found is necessary to our plain language analysis and because the purposes on which each act is predicated must guide our interpretation, we begin by consulting the background and overview of each act.\n2. Purposes of ICWA and WICWA and concurrent interpretation\n\u00b624 Congress enacted ICWA in 1979 to address \u201c \u2018the consequences to Indian children, Indian families, and Indian tribes of abusive child welfare practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of Indian children from their families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement, usually in non-Indian homes.\u2019 \u201d Adoptive Couple, 133 S. Ct. at 2557 (quoting Miss. Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30, 32, 109 S. Ct. 1597, 104 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1989)). Congressional action was prompted by the \u201c \u2018alarmingly high percentage of Indian families . . . broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies,\u2019 \u201d which Congress described as the \u201c \u2018wholesale removal of Indian children from their homes.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901(4); Miss. Band of Choctaw, 490 U.S. at 32). ICWA provides heightened protections in order\nto protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture, and by providing for assistance to Indian tribes in the operation of child and family service programs.\n25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902.\n\u00b625 Among other requirements, ICWA demands a higher burden of proof before the trial court may terminate the relationship between an Indian child and his parent. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f).\n\u00b626 Importantly, after its protections are triggered, ICWA states:\nAny party seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law shah satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\n25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d) (emphasis added). ICWA, however, does not define \u201cactive efforts,\u201d nor does it indicate the requisite amount of services required before the termination of parental rights may occur.\n\u00b627 In 2011, Washington joined several other states by enacting its own version of ICWA. Like ICWA, WICWA requires that parties seeking the involuntary termination of parental rights to an Indian child \u201csatisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d RCW 13.38.130(1). Unlike ICWA, however, WICWA provides a definition for \u201cactive efforts.\u201d RCW 13.38.040(1).\n\u00b628 As part of its express intent, WICWA states that it \u201cis a step in clarifying existing laws and codifying existing policies and practices,\u201d but that it is \u201cnot [to] be construed to reject or eliminate current policies and practices that are not included in its provisions.\u201d RCW 13.38.030. In addition to the analogous, and in some provisions identical, statutory language found in both acts, several of WICWA\u2019s provisions explain that compliance with the requirements of WICWA equates to compliance with ICWA. See, e.g., RCW 13.38.040(2) (defining \u201cbest interests of the Indian child\u201d), .030 (legislative intent is that the same resources should serve as persuasive authority for interpreting both ICWA and WICWA), .070 (adopting federal standards for determination of Indian status), .140 (compliance with both acts for emergency removal of children).\n\u00b629 ICWA, by its express language, permits states to expand the protections that it provides. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1921 (declaring that when ICWA applies, it will yield to state laws that provide \u201ca higher standard of protection to the rights of the parent or Indian custodian of an Indian child\u201d). WICWA contains a similar provision indicating that it seeks to provide minimum requirements to child custody proceedings but that nothing in its provisions should be read as preventing higher standards of protection. See RCW 13.38.030. WICWA also clarifies that it is not meant to \u201caffect, impair, or limit rights or remedies\u201d available under ICWA. RCW 13.38.190(2).\n\u00b630 Considering these provisions, our legislature\u2019s desire to import much of the language of ICWA into WICWA, and WICWA\u2019s aim of clarifying existing law, our belief is that the acts should be read as coextensive barring specific differences in their statutory language. See In re W.B.,55 Cal. 4th 30, 54, 281 P.3d 906, 144 Cal. Rptr. 3d 843 (2012). In this way, and consistent with ICWA\u2019s unambiguous directive, the acts will be interpreted as analogous and conterminous unless one provides greater protection, in which case the more protective act will supplant the less protective act. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1921.\n3. ICWA and WICWA application\n\u00b631 As defined by ICWA, an \u201cIndian child\u201d is \u201cany unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4). ICWA defines \u201cparent\u201d as \u201cany biological parent or parents of an Indian child or any Indian person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child, including adoptions under tribal law or custom.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(9). As unambiguously set forth in its provisions, ICWA must be applied to all \u201cchild custody proceeding[s],\u201d which it defines to include \u201c\u2018foster care placement,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018preadoptive placement,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018adoptive placement,\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018termination of parental rights\u2019 \u201d to an Indian child. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(1). ICWA expressly exempts two types of proceedings\u2014delinquency proceedings and custody determinations following divorce when one parent retains custody of the Indian child. Id. Reading these provisions together, the heightened protections of ICWA are triggered if (1) the child at issue is an Indian child and (2) the proceedings are child custody proceedings that are not subject to either of the two express exemptions. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(1), (4); see also William N. Smith & Richard T. Okrent, The Washington State Indian Child Welfare Act: Putting the Policy Back into the Law, 2 Am. Indian L.J. 146, 148 (2013) (citing 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(4), 1911(b)).\n\u00b632 The requirements of ICWA and WICWA are analogous in many of these respects. WICWA\u2019s definition of \u201cIndian child\u201d is nearly identical to ICWA\u2019s definition. See RCW 13.38.040(7) (\u201c \u2018Indian child\u2019 means an unmarried and unemancipated Indian person who is under eighteen years of age and is either: (a) A member of an Indian tribe; or (b) eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.\u201d). Under WICWA, \u201cparent\u201d is defined as \u201ca biological parent or parents of an Indian child or a person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child, including adoptions made under tribal law or custom.\u201d RCW 13.38.040(13). The express language of WICWA states that it \u201cshall apply in all child custody proceedings.\u201d RCW 13.38.020 (emphasis added). WICWA also defines \u201cchild custody proceeding\u201d to include foster care placement, termination of parental rights, preadoptive placement, and adoptive placement. RCW 13-.38.040(3). Like ICWA, WICWA exempts custody determinations stemming from delinquency proceedings and custody determinations following divorce where one parent retains custody. Id.\n\u00b633 The plain language of both acts emphasizes that application is predicated on an Indian child\u2019s involvement in a child custody proceeding without reference to the Indian status of the parents. A reasonable reading of the plain and unambiguous language indicates that both ICWA and WICWA condition applicability not on the Indian status of the parents, but rather on the Indian status of the child.\n\u00b634 The conclusion that both acts apply regardless of the parents\u2019 statuses is further supported by their definitional sections. Congress and our legislature took great care to qualify several different parties as \u201cIndian.\u201d See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4) (\u201c \u2018Indian child\u2019 \u201d), (5) (\u201c \u2018Indian child\u2019s tribe\u2019 \u201d), (6) (\u201c \u2018Indian custodian\u2019 \u201d), (7) (\u201c \u2018Indian organization\u2019 \u201d), (8) (\u201c\u2018Indian tribe\u2019\u201d); see also RCW 13.38.040(6)-(II). This qualification, however, was not used to modify \u201cparent\u201d under ICWA, nor does the definition of \u201cparent\u201d as \u201cany biological parent or parents of an Indian child\u201d permit application of ICWA to differ based on the parents\u2019 Indian statuses. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(9) (emphasis added); see also RCW 13.38.040(13).\n\u00b635 As part of our plain language analysis, we should also consider the stated purposes of both ICWA and WICWA. The stated purposes confirm our interpretation. Indeed, Congress\u2019 and our legislature\u2019s purposes evidence that the provisions of their respective statutes depend not on the status of either parent but instead on the status of the child. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902 (\u201cThe Congress hereby declares that it is the policy of this Nation to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families.\u201d (emphasis added)); RCW 13.38.030 (same); see also 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901(3) (Congressional findings indicate \u201cthat there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children and that the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, in protecting Indian children who are members of or are eligible for membership in an Indian tribe.\u201d (emphasis added)). Both acts signal an intent to protect Indian children and tribal relationships, but neither premises applicability on the Indian status of the parents.\n\u00b636 Finally, we have the benefit of an additional source that confirms our current interpretation\u2014one that was not made available until after oral arguments in this case\u2014the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) rule regarding ICWA proceedings in state courts. See Indian Child Welfare Act Proceedings, 81 Fed. Reg. 38,778 (June 14, 2016) (to be codified at 25 C.F.R. pt. 23). The stated purpose of this rule is to \u201caddress! ] requirements for State courts in ensuring implementation of ICWA in Indian child-welfare proceedings.\u201d Id. at 38,778. Though the rules do not come into effect until December 12,2016, they are nevertheless informative. Regarding the definition of \u201cIndian family\u201d for the purposes of the active efforts provisions, the BIA\u2019s commentary states, \u201cThe term \u2018Indian family\u2019 is also found in 25 U.S.C. 1912(d)..., and it is clear from context that this means the Indian child\u2019s family.\u201d Id. at 38,798 (emphasis added). Again, this evidences that whether a family meets the requirements of an Indian family\u2014and is therefore subject to the active efforts requirement at issue in this case\u2014is not premised on the Indian status of the parents but is instead based on whether the child is an Indian child.\n\u00b637 For these reasons, we hold that whether the parent whose rights are being terminated is non-Indian is immaterial to a finding that ICWA and WICWA apply. If the child at issue is an Indian child and that child is involved in a child custody proceeding, ICWA and WICWA shall apply.\n4. ICWA and WICWA application to the present proceedings\n\u00b638 R.B. and C.B. also argue that the present action is not a child custody proceeding, which they contend should preclude application of ICWA and WICWA. We disagree.\n\u00b639 Both ICWA and WICWA define \u201cchild custody proceeding\u201d to include the \u201c \u2018termination of parental rights,\u2019 \u201d which includes \u201cany action resulting in the termination of the parent-child relationship.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(1)(ii) (emphasis added); RCW 13.38.040(3)(b). There is no dispute that the proceeding at issue had as its purpose the termination of C.W.\u2019s parental rights to T.A.W. This, in conjunction with the undisputed fact that T.A.W. is an Indian child, is sufficient to trigger both ICWA\u2019s and WICWA\u2019s heightened protections. If this were not enough, the concurrent purpose of the trial proceeding was to enter an adoption decree that would permit R.B. to adopt T.A.W. The acts define \u201cchild custody proceeding\u201d to include \u201c \u2018adoptive placement,\u2019 \u201d which they deem \u201cthe permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption, including any action resulting in a final decree of adoption.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(1)(iv) (emphasis added); RCW 13.38.040(3)(d). This too requires application of ICWA and WICWA.\n\u00b640 Although R.B. and C.B. argue that ICWA and WICWA protect only Indian parents, the language of both acts plainly and unambiguously necessitates their application in the present case. This is so because (1) T.A.W. is an Indian child and (2) the termination proceedings clearly met the definition of \u201cchild custody proceeding.\u201d The Court of Appeals did not err in making this determination.\nB. ICWA and WICWA apply in stepparent adoption cases\n\u00b641 R.B. and C.B. next suggest that ICWA and WICWA are inapplicable to stepparent adoptions when the parental rights being terminated belong to a non-Indian. As explained in the preceding section, neither ICWA nor WICWA condition applicability on parents\u2019 Indian statuses. Still, whether the acts were meant to apply to stepparent adoption is a question that this court has yet to address. We hold that ICWA and WICWA apply in stepparent adoption cases.\n\u00b642 The plain language of ICWA and WICWA is telling of the applicability to stepparent adoptions. As previously stated, ICWA and WICWA both apply to child custody proceedings, which include all termination and adoption proceedings. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(1)(ii), (iv); RCW 13.38-.040(3)(b), (d). Neither scheme limits application to state-initiated terminations or adoptions.\n\u00b643 In the present case, R.B.\u2019s adoption of T.A.W. cannot proceed unless C.W.\u2019s parental rights are first terminated. As explained above, the current action is a child custody proceeding within the meaning of both acts under the termination and adoption provisions. Stepparent adoptions like the one at issue, however, do not fall into either of the expressly stated exceptions to ICWA or WICWA\u2014that is, it is not a delinquency proceeding or custody determination made during a divorce in which one parent retains custody. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(1); RCW 13.38.040. Further, neither statutory scheme exempts custody disputes within an extended family, nor do they condition coverage based on the identity of the postadoption parent. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(1)(iv); RCW 13.38.040(3)(d).\n\u00b644 The plain language of ICWA and WICWA provides no exception to coverage if adoption is sought by a stepparent. Legislative history from both ICWA and WICWA confirms our reading. The legislative histories of both acts lack any discussion of stepparent adoptions. However, \u201c[w]e presume that the legislature enacts laws \u2018with full knowledge of existing laws.\u2019 \u201d Maziar v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 183 Wn.2d 84, 88, 349 P.3d 826 (2015) (quoting Thurston County v. Gorton, 85 Wn.2d 133, 138, 530 P.2d 309 (1975)); see also Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp.,_U.S._, 134 S. Ct. 736, 742, 187 L. Ed. 2d 654 (2014) (\u201c[W]e presume that \u2018Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.\u2019 \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Hall v. United States, 566 U.S. 506, 516, 132 S. Ct. 1882, 182 L. Ed. 2d 840 (2012))).\n\u00b645 Washington has had a stepparent adoption statute since 1979, which long predates the passage of WICWA. See former RCW 26.32.056 (1979). Many other states also have stepparent adoption statutes predating Congress\u2019 passage of ICWA. See In re N.B., 199 P.3d 16, 19 (Colo. App. 2007) (collecting statutes and cases addressing stepparent adoption).\n\u00b646 Given Congress\u2019 and our legislature\u2019s presumed awareness of stepparent adoptions when they enacted ICWA and WICWA, had they wished to except stepparent adoption from coverage they would have explicitly done so. Congress and our legislature made only two exceptions to when the protections of ICWA and WICWA would otherwise be invoked. Absent express legislative intent to the contrary, we refuse to create any additional exceptions. See Anthis v. Copland, 173 Wn.2d 752, 765, 270 P.3d 574 (2012) (citing State v. Taylor, 97 Wn.2d 724, 728-29, 649 P.2d 633 (1982)). We hold that ICWA and WICWA apply to stepparent adoptions.\nC. The active efforts provision of ICWA and WICWA apply to privately initiated terminations when the child will remain with the Indian parent\n\u00b647 Despite our holding that ICWA and WICWA apply to the present case, R.B. and C.B. assert that the active efforts provisions of ICWA and WICWA do not apply for two reasons. First, they claim that the active efforts provisions were intended to apply to only state-initiated terminations. Second, they argue that the active efforts provisions should not apply when the child will not be removed from an Indian parent. We reject both arguments.\n1. The active efforts provisions apply to both state and privately initiated terminations\n\u00b648 Both ICWA and WICWA require that \u201cactive efforts\u201d be undertaken to remedy and rehabilitate the parents of Indian children before their parental rights may be terminated. R.B. and C.B. believe that to require a private party to assume active efforts would be \u201cnonsensical\u201d and \u201cabsurd.\u201d Pet. for Review at 7, 12. In R.B. and C.B.\u2019s view, the active efforts requirements are concerned with only state-initiated proceedings.\n\u00b649 As the first step in statutory interpretation, we turn initially to the plain language of the statutes. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d) states:\nAny party seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\nSimilarly, RCW 13.38.130(1) reads:\nA party seeking to effect an involuntary foster care placement of or the involuntary termination of parental rights to an Indian child shah satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\n\u00b650 The plain language of ICWA requires any party seeking to terminate parental rights to an Indian child to produce sufficient evidence to satisfy that active efforts have been made. Congress used the word \u201cany\u201d to modify \u201cparty,\u201d and \u201cWashington courts have consistently interpreted the word \u2018any\u2019 to mean \u2018every\u2019 and \u2018all.\u2019 \u201d Stahl v. Delicor of Puget Sound, Inc., 148 Wn.2d 876, 884-85, 64 P.3d 10 (2003) (citing State v. Tili, 139 Wn.2d 107, 115, 985 P.2d 365 (1999)). Thus, under ICWA, we hold that any party, including a parent seeking to involuntarily terminate the parental rights of the other parent, must comply with the active efforts requirements articulated in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d). ICWA offers no exceptions for privately initiated actions.\n\u00b651 The language of RCW 13.38.130(1) is less telling, but WICWA\u2019s definition of \u201cactive efforts\u201d leads us to the same conclusion. Subsection (a) of the definition clarifies that the active efforts provision applies to any foster care placement or termination proceeding in which \u201cthe department[] or a supervising agency\u201d is statutorily or contractually obligated to provide or procure services. RCW 13.38.040(1)(a). Subsection (b) applies the same active efforts requirements to any adoption or termination proceeding initiated by a party that is not contractually or statutorily obligated to provide services to the parents. RCW 13.38.040(1)(b).\n\u00b652 Since RCW 13.38.040(1) provides requirements for both state and nonstate entities, the legislature clearly contemplated WICWA\u2019s active efforts provision would apply to more than just state-initiated termination and adoption proceedings. This directly refutes R.B. and C.B.\u2019s argument that the legislature meant for the active efforts provision to apply to only state-initiated terminations. We therefore hold WICWA applies to privately initiated terminations.\n\u00b653 Because this is a termination proceeding and R.B. and C.B. were not contractually or statutorily required to directly provide or procure services to C.W., R.B. and C.B. fall within the RCW 13.38.040(1)(b) definition. This being so, under the plain language of both ICWA and WICWA, R.B. and C.B. were not exempt and were required to show that C.W. received active efforts before his parental rights were terminated. The trial court made no finding as to active efforts made by R.B. and C.B.; thus, R.B. and C.B. must prove on remand that active efforts have been provided to C.W. prior to the termination of his parental rights.\n2. The existing Indian family doctrine does not except this case from ICWA or WICWA coverage\n\u00b654 Although R.B. and C.B. maintain the active efforts provisions do not apply to privately initiated terminations, in the alternative they claim that even if ICWA and WICWA would normally apply to the present case, they are exempt because C.W. is non-Indian. This, they claim, is determinative of the acts\u2019 application because the termination of C.W.\u2019s parental rights would not result in the \u201cbreakup of the Indian family\u201d as is required under the \u201cactive efforts\u201d provisions found in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d) and RCW 13.38-.130(1). R.B. and C.B. assert that since they are both native, they constitute the \u201cIndian family\u201d that would remain intact if C.W.\u2019s parental rights were terminated.\na) The plain language of ICWA and WICWA unambiguously confirms that \u201cbreakup of the Indian family\u201d refers to the termination of a biological parent\u2019s parental rights to an \u201cIndian child\u201d regardless of that parent\u2019s Indian status\n\u00b655 Though both acts refer to the \u201cbreakup of the Indian family\u201d in their active efforts provisions, neither defines \u201cIndian family\u201d or contains the phrase \u201cexisting.\u201d See In re Baby Boy C., 27 A.D.3d 34, 48, 805 N.Y.S.2d 313 (2005). However, \u201c[t]o determine the plain meaning of an undefined term, we may look to the dictionary.\u201d Home-Street, 166 Wn.2d at 451 (citing Garrison v. Wash. State Nursing Bd., 87 Wn.2d 195, 196, 550 P.2d 7 (1976)). \u201c[T]he definition of\u2018family\u2019 necessarily depends on the field of law in which the word is used, the purpose intended to be accomplished by its use, and facts and circumstances in each case.\u201d Claymore v. Serr, 405 N.W.2d 650, 654 (S.D. 1987) (citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 543 (5th ed. 1983)). \u201cMost commonly [\u2018family\u2019] refers to a group of persons consisting of parents and children; immediate kindred, constituting the fundamental social unit in civilized society.\u201d Id.\n\u00b656 Both ICWA and WICWA provide definitions for \u201cextended family member\u201d that include \u201cthe Indian child\u2019s grandparent, aunt or uncle, brother or sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, niece or nephew, first or second cousin, or stepparent.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(2); RCW 13.38.040(8). Because the \u201cextended family member\u201d definition encompasses many of those outside the immediate family, it is likely that Congress and our legislature intended \u201cIndian family\u201d to include only the nuclear family with the \u201cIndian child\u201d at the center. We therefore hold that \u201cIndian family,\u201d in the context of the active efforts provisions, refers to the relationship between the Indian child and his parents.\n\u00b657 This conclusion is supported by the BIA guidelines and confirmed by the BIA\u2019s recently issued commentary concerning ICWA proceedings in state courts. The BIA guidelines state that \u201c \u2018breakup of the Indian family\u2019 \u201d refers to a situation where a parent is unable or unwilling to raise the Indian child in a healthy manner emotionally or physically. Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 44 Fed. Reg. 67,584,67,592, Guideline D.2 cmt. (Nov. 26, 1979). The guidelines therefore affirm that \u201cIndian family\u201d refers to the relationship between the Indian child and his parents. The BIA\u2019s recent commentary also unambiguously confirms our view, stating:\nComment: A commenter suggested clarifying . . . that the active-efforts requirements apply to parents of an Indian child, not simply to Indian parents.\nResponse: ICWA applies when an Indian child is the subject of a child-custody proceeding, and the active-efforts requirement of 25 U.S.C. 1912(d) applies to the foster-care placement or termination of parental rights to an Indian child. The child\u2019s family is an \u201cIndian family\u201d because the child meets the definition of an \u201cIndian child.\u201d As such, active efforts are required to prevent the breakup of the Indian child\u2019s family, regardless of whether individual members of the family are themselves Indian.\nIndian Child Welfare Proceedings, 81 Fed. Reg. 38,778, 38,815 (June 14, 2016).\n\u00b658 Again, none of these sources premise application on the parent\u2019s Indian status. We therefore hold that \u201cbreakup of the Indian family\u201d refers to a situation, such as the one at present, in which a party seeks to terminate a biological parent\u2019s rights to an Indian child.\nb) WICWA overruled the existing Indian family exception\n\u00b659 In addition to the argument that \u201cIndian family\u201d does not refer to non-Indian parents\u2019 relationships to their Indian children, R.B. and C.B. maintain that the existing Indian family exception exempts the present case from ICWA and WICWA coverage. We disagree and hold that the existing Indian family exception was legislatively overruled by the enactment of WICWA.\n\u00b660 \u201c \u2018The existing Indian family exception is\u2019 a court made doctrine that exempts \u2018application of the ICWA\u2019 in those cases where the Indian child\u2019s family has not \u2018maintained a significant social, cultural, or political relationship with [their] tribe.\u2019 \u201d Shawn L. Murphy, The Supreme Court\u2019s Revitalization of the Dying \u201cExisting Indian Family\u201d Exception, 46 McGeorge L. Rev. 629, 636 (2014) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Barbara Atwood, Flashpoints under the Indian Child Welfare Act: Toward a New Understanding of State Court Resistance, 51 Emory L.J. 587, 625 (2002)).\n\u00b661 We initially embraced the existing Indian family exception in In re Adoption of Crews, 118 Wn.2d 561, 825 P.2d 305 (1992). There, we explained,\n[T]here is no allegation by [the biological mother] or the [Indian child\u2019s tribe] that, if custody were returned to [the biological mother], [the child] would grow up in an Indian environment. To the contrary, [the biological mother] has shown no substantive interest in her Indian heritage in the past and has given no indication this will change in the future.\nWhile [the child] may be an \u201cIndian child\u201d based on the [tribal constitution], we do not find an existing Indian family unit or environment from which [the child] was removed or to which he would be returned. To apply ICWA in this specific situation would not further the policies and purposes of ICWA.\nId. at 569.\n\u00b662 The legislature\u2019s recent enactment of WICWA requires that we reconsider our adoption of the existing Indian family exception.\n\u00b663 Under our above interpretation of ICWA and WICWA, if a case (1) meets the definition of a \u201cchild custody proceeding\u201d and (2) involves an Indian child, both acts shall apply. ICWA and WICWA recognize only two exceptions to coverage\u2014delinquency proceedings and custody disputes following divorce where one parent retains custody of the Indian child. Our interpretation therefore overrules Crews to the extent that it embraced the existing Indian family exception because it recognizes no additional exceptions to coverage outside of the two expressly stated in ICWA and WICWA.\n3. Adoptive Couple does not preclude application of ICWA or WICWA\n\u00b664 Next, R.B. and C.B. claim that if ICWA is applicable to the present case, then this court is bound by the Adoptive Couple decision and must apply the abandonment exception to ICWA. R.B. and C.B. argue that the facts of their case are analogous to those considered by the Supreme Court in Adoptive Couple, meriting our application of ICWA\u2019s abandonment exception to the present case. The Court of Appeals\u2019 holding as it related to Adoptive Couple was twofold: first, the court found that the two cases are factually dissimilar; second, the court reasoned that the Adoptive Couple decision interpreted only the federal ICWA and was therefore not binding on the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of WICWA. We agree.\n\u00b665 In Adoptive Couple, the Court held that the State could involuntarily terminate the parental rights of a biological Indian father who had abandoned his Indian child without triggering ICWA\u2019s protections. 133 S. Ct. at 2552. In that case, the father, a member of the Cherokee Nation, refused to support the child and voluntarily relinquished his parental rights in lieu of paying child support. Id. at 2558. The biological mother had no Indian ties, and after learning that the father would not support the child, the mother placed the child up for adoption. Id. It was undisputed that the biological father made no attempt to support the child or to assume any parental duties during the first four months of the child\u2019s life. Id. The day after receiving the adoption notice, the father contacted an attorney, who immediately requested a stay of the adoption proceedings. Id. at 2558-59.\n\u00b666 The South Carolina Family Court, invoking 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f), ruled that the adoptive couple had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the child would suffer serious emotional or physical damage if the biological father had custody. Id. at 2559. The adoptive couple was forced to hand over the child to the biological father, whom she had never met, when she was 27 months old. Id. The South Carolina Supreme Court upheld this determination. Id.\n\u00b667 The Supreme Court reversed the South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s decision. In so doing, the Court reasoned that ICWA, by its text, was aimed at the unwarranted removal of Indian children from Indian families. Id. at 2561. Thus, the Court concluded, when \u201cthe adoption of an Indian child is voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent with sole custodial rights, the ICWA\u2019s primary goal of preventing the unwarranted removal of Indian children and the dissolution of Indian families is not implicated.\u201d Id. Because the biological father never had legal or physical custody of the child, he could not invoke the protections of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f). Id. at 2562. The Court relied on the state parentage laws of Oklahoma (where the biological parents were domiciled) and South Carolina (where the adoption took place) to determine that the biological father never had legal custody of the child prior to the family court\u2019s ruling. Id.\n\u00b668 The Court also held that ICWA\u2019s active efforts provision did not apply under the facts of the case because the father abandoned the child prior to her birth and never had legal or physical custody of the child. For these reasons, there was no relationship to \u201cbreak up\u201d because the \u201cbreakup\u201d of the relationship had long since occurred. Id.\n\u00b669 The facts of Adoptive Couple are distinguishable from those in the current case, and the distinctions necessitate a different outcome. Under Washington law, because C.B. and C.W. were married at the time T.A.W. was born, C.W. was presumed to be his father. RCW 26.26.116(1)(a). This has never been disputed. Pursuant to the Court\u2019s analysis in Adoptive Couple, RCW 26.26.116(1)(a) establishes that C.W. had legal custody of T.A.W. because he was T.A.W.\u2019s father from birth. Additionally, it remains undisputed that for at least four months following T.A.W.\u2019s birth, C.W. lived with C.B. and shared parental responsibility for T.A.W. This establishes, consistent with Adoptive Couple, that C.W. had actual physical custody of T.A.W. for a time. Even following C.B. and C.W.\u2019s divorce, C.W. retained visitation rights with T.A.W. Finally, C.W. has never voluntarily relinquished his parental rights to T.A.W. and has never evidenced an intent to do so. In fact, C.W. attempted to reestablish visitation following his second release from prison. These facts are plainly distinct from those considered in Adoptive Couple. Unlike Adoptive Couple, there is still an \u201cIndian family\u201d to be broken up should C.W.\u2019s rights be terminated.\n\u00b670 Also, because of the abandonment exception, ICWA supports an independent interpretation and application of WICWA in the present case. As previously explained, once its protections are triggered, WICWA excepts only delinquency proceedings and custody determinations following divorce where one parent retains custody\u2014there is no additional exception for abandonment under WICWA. Our interpretation of WICWA therefore provides additional protection to the parents of Indian children by preventing termination when tribal culture would otherwise permit the long-term absence of parents. See Dustin C. Jones, Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl: The Creation of Second-Class Native American Parents under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, 32 Law & Ineq. 421, 423 (2014) (explaining that the Court\u2019s decision creates an additional exception that disregards Indian customs and values). ICWA provides:\nIn any case where State or Federal law applicable to a child custody proceeding under State or Federal law provides a higher standard of protection to the rights of the parent or Indian custodian of an Indian child than the rights provided under this subchapter, the State or Federal court shall apply the State or Federal standard.\n25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1921; see also D.J. v. P.C., 36 P.3d 663, 672 (Alaska 2001). We hold that because WICWA provides greater protection to C.W., a \u201cparent\u201d under both ICWA and WICWA, the Court of Appeals did not err by applying only WICWA and rejecting R.B. and C.B.\u2019s claim that C.W. abandoned T.A.W. under ICWA.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\u00b671 We hold that (1) ICWA and WICWA protect the rights of non-Indian parents and Indian parents alike, (2) ICWA and WICWA apply to stepparent adoptions, (3) ICWA and WICWA require private parties initiating terminations to prove that active efforts have been provided to any parent of an Indian child, regardless of their Indian status, before a termination may occur, and (4) WICWA does not contain an abandonment exception. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court so that it may reconsider the termination petition in light of these holdings.\nJohnson, Owens, Stephens, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, Gordon McCloud, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nWith the understanding that \u201cIndian\u201d may not be preferred when referencing Native Americans, American Indians, indigenous peoples, or First Nations, we use the term throughout this opinion only because it is the expression adopted by both ICWA and WICWA. We intend no disrespect.\nT.A.W. is also an enrolled member of the Shoalwater Bay Tribe.\nR.B. is Native American, but the record indicates that he has no formal tribal membership.\nRCW 26.33.200(1) requires a postplacement report \u201cto determine the nature and adequacy of the placement and to determine if the placement is in the best interest of the child.\u2019\u2019\nRAP 18.13A grants accelerated review for orders terminating parental rights.\nThe Court of Appeals held C.W. could properly raise the active efforts argument on appeal, despite his failure to do so at trial, pursuant to RAP 2.5(a)(2), because it applied when \u201cproof of particular facts at trial is required to sustain a claim.\u2019\u2019 T.A.W., 188 Wn. App. at 807-08. R.B. and C.B. do not challenge that holding.\nAccording to ICWA:\nNo termination of parental rights may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\n25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f).\nSee, e.g., Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 232B.1-232B.14 (Iowa Indian Child Welfare Act); Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 712B.1-712B.41 (Michigan Indian Family Preservation Act); Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 260.751-260.835 (Minnesota Indian Family Preservation Act); Neb. Rev.

Pet. for Review at 11. Instead, they contend the divorce between C.B. and C.W. caused the breakup, and because custody disputes stemming from divorce are not covered by ICWA or WICWA, it follows that ICWA and WICWA do not apply. R.B. and C.B. are correct that ICWA does not cover custody determinations springing from divorce proceedings where one of the parents retains custody of the Indian child. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(1); RCW 13.38.040(3). However, R.B. and C.B. mischaracterize the nature of the proceedings below. Involuntary adoptive proceedings, like the one at issue, do not spring forth from divorce, but are instead independent statutory proceedings. In re Adoption of R.L.A., 2006 OK CIV APP 138, 147 P.3d 306, 308. In a divorce, the parties are the husband and wife attempting to dissolve their marriage, not a spouse who later becomes a stepparent. Id. A reading of the definitional sections of ICWA and WICWA confirms this view. Stepparents are not included in the definition of \u201cparent,\u201d but are instead found in the \u201cextended family member\u201d term. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(2); RCW 13.38.040(8). The \u201cdivorce proceeding\u201d exceptions of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(1) and RCW 13.38.040(3) pertain only to \u201cparents\u201d under the acts. By their plain language, the divorce exception cannot apply to a proceeding in which a stepparent is a party. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(1); RCW 13.38.040(3). Because the proceedings at issue include R.B., T.A.W.\u2019s stepparent, the divorce proceeding exception is not applicable.\nIn the ruling granting review, Commissioner Pierce recognized that the Court of Appeals grounded its conclusion that ICWA applies in all termination cases involving an Indian child largely on amendments made to the Juvenile Court Act in Cases Relating to Dependency of a Child and the Termination of a Parent and Child Relationship, chapter 13.34 RCW, in 2004. Specifically, the Court of Appeals stated, \u201cThis statute unequivocally provides that under Washington law, ICWA applies to all termination cases in which the child is an Indian. RCW 13.34.040(3) does not condition the application of ICWA on whether the parent also is an Indian.\u2019\u2019 T.A.W., 188 Wn. App. at 810. The commissioner\u2019s ruling considered the argument that the legislature\u2019s purpose in amending these provisions\u2014to provide only adequate notice in ICWA eligible cases\u2014may impact our plain language statutory analysis. If this in fact is true, the commissioner reasoned, we would be justified in revisiting the extent of the Court of Appeals\u2019 broad ruling. See Ruling Granting Review, In re Adoption of TAW.,No. 92127-0, at 6 (Wash. Jan. 14, 2016). Although R.B. and C.B. now attempt to adopt that argument, neither party raised it prior to arriving at this court. Further, even if the Court of Appeals\u2019 reading of the amendments may overstate the purpose of those amendments as envisioned by the legislature, any doubt as to the broad reach of ICWA in cases involving Indian children was resolved with the passage of WICWA, which clarifies its provisions shall apply in all \u201cchild custody proceedings.\u2019\u2019 RCW 13.38.020. Because of (1) the nature of the proceedings (termination and adoption) and (2) T.A.W.\u2019s status as an Indian child, ICWA and WICWA apply in this case. See also Jean K. v. Jeremy M., No. 1CA-JV 15-0135, 2015 WL 4748010, at *1, 2015 Ariz. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1014, at *1-3 (Ariz. Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2015) (unpublished) (holding that biological mother could assert ICWA protections when the record contained no evidence that she was a member of an Indian tribe).\nSeveral other states considering the applicability of ICWA to stepparent adoptions have come to the same conclusion. See, e.g., N.B., 199 P.3d at 19; In re Crystal K., 226 Cal. App. 3d 655, 662-66, 276 Cal. Rptr. 619 (1990);R.L.A., 147 P.3d at 308-09; State ex rel. D.A.C., 933 P.2d 993, 997-1001 (Utah Ct. App. 1997).\nWICWA, RCW 13.38.040(1), in relevant part defines \u201cactive efforts\u2019\u2019:\n(a) In any foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding of an Indian child under chapter 13.34 RCW and this chapter where the department or a supervising agency as defined in RCW 74.13.020 has a statutory or contractual duty to provide services to, or procure services for, the parent or parents or Indian custodian, or is providing services to a parent or parents or Indian custodian pursuant to a disposition order entered pursuant to RCW 13.34.130, the department or supervising agency shall make timely and diligent efforts to provide or procure such services, including engaging the parent or parents or Indian custodian in reasonably available and culturally appropriate preventive, remedial, or rehabilitative services. This shall include those services offered by tribes and Indian organizations whenever possible. At a minimum \u201cactive efforts\u2019\u2019 shall include:\n(iii) In any termination of parental rights proceeding regarding an Indian child under chapter 13.34 RCW in which the department or supervising agency provided services to the parent, parents, or Indian custodian, a showing to the court that the department or supervising agency social workers actively worked with the parent, parents, or Indian custodian to engage them in remedial services and rehabilitation programs ordered by the court or identified in the department or supervising agency\u2019s individual service and safety plan beyond simply providing referrals to such services.\n(b) In any foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding in which the petitioner does not otherwise have a statutory or contractual duty to directly provide services to, or procure services for, the parent or Indian custodian, \u201cactive efforts\u2019\u2019 means a documented, concerted, and good faith effort to facilitate the parent\u2019s or Indian custodian\u2019s receipt of and engagement in services capable of meeting the criteria set out in (a) of this subsection.\nUnder WICWA,\n\u201c[department\u2019\u2019 means the department of social and health services and any of its divisions. \u201cDepartment\u2019\u2019 also includes supervising agencies as defined in RCW 74.13.020(12) with which the department entered into a contract to provide services, care, placement, case management, contract monitoring, or supervision to children subject to a petition filed under chapter 13.34 or 26.33 RCW.\nRCW 13.38.040(5) (reviser\u2019s note omitted).\nBecause the trial court made no findings as to the active efforts provided to C.W., the adequacy of the efforts made is a question not before this court. The dissent criticizes us for not giving deference to the discretion vested in the trial court, dissent at 862-63, but the trial court must exercise its discretion before deference can be given. Also, it is incorrect for the dissent to imply more is expected of the mother, id. at 868; rather, more is expected of the trial judge so that on review we can ensure that the requirements of ICWA and WICWA were met.\nUnder 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(2),\n\u201cextended family member\u2019\u2019 shall be as defined by the law or custom of the Indian child\u2019s tribe or, in the absence of such law or custom, shall be a person who has reached the age of eighteen and who is the Indian child\u2019s grandparent, aunt or uncle, brother or sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, niece or nephew, first or second cousin, or stepparent.\nUnder RCW 13.38.040(8),\n\u201cextended family member\u2019\u2019 means an individual, defined by the law or custom of the child\u2019s tribe, as a relative of the child. If the child\u2019s tribe does not identify such individuals by law or custom, the term means an adult who is the Indian child\u2019s grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother, sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, niece, nephew, first or second cousin, or stepparent, even following termination of the marriage.\nCourts considering this question have likewise interpreted \u201cIndian family\u2019\u2019 to mean the parents of an Indian child or the child\u2019s Indian guardian. Crystal K., 226 Cal. App. 3d at 667 (\u201c[25 U.S.C.] section 1912(d) is simply directed at \u2018attemptfs] to preserve the parent-child relationship.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 (second alteration in original) (quoting In re Pima County Juvenile Action No. S-903, 130 Ariz. 202, 208, 635 P.2d 187 (Ct. App. 1981))); State ex rel C.D. v. State, 2008 UT App. 477, \u00b6 30, 200 P.3d 194 (\u201c[T]he State must demonstrate that active efforts have been made with respect to the specific parent or Indian custodian from whom the Indian children are being removed or provide evidence that such efforts would be futile.\u2019\u2019).\nThe BIA\u2019s recent commentary confirms this is the correct view: \u201c[T]here is not an \u2018existing Indian family\u2019 exception to ICWA.\u201d 81 Fed. Reg. at 38,815.\nR.B. and C.B. argue that if we deem that ICWA and WICWA apply to their case, then such application would be unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. They raised this argument for the first time in their petition for review; thus, we will not address it. See Crystal Ridge Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. City of Bothell, 182 Wn.2d 665, 678, 343 P.3d 746 (2015) (\u201cThis court generally does not consider issues, even constitutional ones, raised first in a petition for review.\u2019\u2019 (citing State v. Benn, 161 Wn.2d 256, 262 n.1, 165 P.3d 1232 (2007))). Moreover, R.B. and C.B. provide no support for this argument besides dictum from Adoptive Couple. See Pet. for Review at 13. We note several courts have already rejected these arguments because the disparate treatment afforded Indians under ICWA is not race based, but is instead based on their political status in a sovereign government.

Majority at 854. While I agree that these statutes apply here, in my view, the majority\u2019s reading of these provisions gives insufficient deference to the discretion vested in the trial court by the WICWA to assess such efforts in the context of the facts of the case presented. In my view, under the particular circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are adequate and its termination order should be affirmed. Accordingly, I dissent.\nAnalysis\n\u00b673 When construing a statute, our goal is to carry out the intent of the legislature. Seven Gables Corp. v. MGM/UA Entm\u2019t Co., 106 Wn.2d 1, 6, 721 P.2d 1 (1986). We recently explained the appropriate analysis in BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP v. Fulbright, as follows:\n\u201c[W]e strive to ascertain the intention of the legislature by first examining a statute\u2019s plain meaning.\u201d G-P Gypsum Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 169 Wn.2d 304, 309, 237 P.3d 256 (2010) (citing Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 9-10, 43 P.3d 4 (2002)). To glean the meaning of words in a statute, we do not look at those words alone, but \u201c \u2018 \u201call [of] the terms and provisions of the act in relation to the subject of the legislation, the nature of the act, [and] the general object to be accomplished and consequences that would, result from construing the particular statute in one way or another.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Burns v. City of Seattle, 161 Wn.2d 129, 146, 164 P.3d 475 (2007) (quoting State v. Krall, 125 Wn.2d 146, 148, 881 P.2d 1040 (1994) (quoting State v. Huntzinger, 92 Wn.2d 128, 133, 594 P.2d 917 (1979))).\n180 Wn.2d 754, 766, 328 P.3d 895 (2014) (emphasis added) (alterations in original).\n\u00b674 RCW 13.38.130(1) provides, \u201cA party seeking ... the involuntary termination of parental rights to an Indian child shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The WICWA defines \u201cactive efforts\u201d in RCW 13.38.040(1) and states in relevant part:\nIn any . . . termination of parental rights proceeding in which the petitioner does not otherwise have a statutory or contractual duty to directly provide services to, or procure services for, the parent..., \u201cactive efforts\u201d means a documented, concerted, and good faith effort to facilitate the parent\u2019s ... receipt of and engagement in services capable of meeting the criteria set out in (a) of this subsection.\nRCW 13.38.040(1)(b).\n\u00b675 In my view, the trial court\u2019s findings adequately encompass these inquiries. Relevant here, the trial court found that within less than six months after T.A.W.\u2019s December 23, 2007 birth, C.W. was addicted to methamphetamine. In the spring of 2009, C.W. engaged in domestic violence against C.B., and C.B. obtained a temporary protection order and filed for dissolution. During the year preceding these events, \u201c[C.W.] had extremely limited contact with [T.A.W.]. Any contact between the father and the child was initiated by [C.B.] or [C.W.\u2019s] mother, not by any effort of [C.W.].\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 91. The trial court found that \u201c[t]he father has not had face-to-face contact with the child since August 2009, and this failure is the sole responsibility of the father.\u201d Id. The trial court found that \u201c[C.B.] made a good faith effort to establish and maintain a relationship between [C.W.] and the child, and this effort was rejected by [C.W.].\u201dM. Noting that C.W. has been in and out of prison since 2010, the court found that during that time period, C.W. made little or no effort to contact T.A.W. while he was incarcerated and when he was not incarcerated. The court found that from the summer of 2010, C.W. did not communicate with T.A.W. in any way that demonstrated love or affection for the child, that C.W. was \u201ccurrently unfit to parent [T.A.W.],\u201d that C.W. was \u201ccurrently incapable of providing a safe environment for [T.A.W.],\u201d that it is in T.A.W.\u2019s best interest that C.W.\u2019s parental rights be terminated, and that T.A.W. is presently in a \u201cstable home\u201d with C.B. and his stepfather and has bonded with the stepfather. Id. at 92. All of these findings find support in the trial transcript. Yet the majority chooses to discount these findings because the trial court did not expressly label them as addressing C.B.\u2019s \u201cactive efforts\u201d prior to seeking termination of C.W.\u2019s parental rights. Majority at 854 n.16. In my view, the \u201cactive efforts\u201d inquiry is not a talismanic incantation\u2014instead, as discussed below, the judge\u2019s findings fully support the requirements intended by the legislature. That is enough.\n\u00b676 I find persuasive an Iowa appellate court decision addressing a comparable state statute. In In re Interest of C.A.V., the Iowa court held, \u201cThe \u2018active efforts\u2019 requirement must be construed in the context of the existing circumstances.\u201d 787 N.W.2d 96, 104 (Iowa Ct. App. 2010). In C.A.V., like the present case, the mother of an Indian child \u201cencouraged [the father] to participate in his daughter\u2019s life by facilitating visits before his incarceration and by inviting continued contact during his prison stay.\u201d Id. at 103. The mother\u2019s \u201cefforts to preserve the parent-child relationship were not successful because [the father] decided not to communicate with [the child].\u201d Id. When the mother sought termination of the Indian child\u2019s biological father\u2019s parental rights, the Iowa court held that because resources enumerated in the state Indian child welfare statute were not available to the mother, \u201cher duty under the statute was satisfied.\u201d Id. In other words, the mother did all that she could do to facilitate the father\u2019s relationship with the Indian child; those efforts did not include the provision of agency or institutional resources and services that she did not have access to or that were otherwise unavailable. That is the circumstance and the appropriate result here also. Like C.A.V., the mother here facilitated the development of the father\u2019s relationship with the Indian child, but those efforts were unsuccessful. The mother testified concerning her efforts and other efforts to assist C.W., but she could not personally provide institutional resources.\n\u00b677 Further, when the Pacific County Superior Court entered its September 21, 2014 findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order of termination, a domestic violence protection order that prohibited C.W. from having any contact with C.B. or T.A.W. was still in place. Once the no contact order was in place, the existence of that order made any efforts by C.B. to facilitate C.W.\u2019s participation in rehabilitative services (drug treatment) or visitation impracticable. Thus, in my view, considering the \u201cactive efforts\u201d inquiry in the context of the existing circumstances, under the facts of this case any obligation C.B. had to provide \u201cactive efforts\u201d under the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1963, or WICWA was satisfied.\n\u00b678 This approach is in accord with the legislative purpose behind the ICWA and the WICWA. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902 (noting the national policy to protect best interests of Indian children and the stability of Indian tribes); RCW 13.38.030 (noting State\u2019s commitment to protecting tribal relations and best interests of Indian children). As the Iowa decision discussed above opined, \u201cWhile the [state] ICWA focuses on preserving Indian culture, it does not do so at the expense of a child\u2019s right to security and stability.\u201d C.A.V., 787 N.W.2d at 104. Again, I agree. The best interests of the child remains the touchstone even in this termination proceeding.\n\u00b679 In applying the statutes here, we are to keep in mind the \u201c \u2018object to be accomplished\u2019 \u201d by the legislation and the \u201c \u2018consequences that would result\u2019 \u201d from construing the statute one way or another. BAC Home Loans, 180 Wn.2d at 766 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Burns, 161 Wn.2d at 146). Here, the trial court\u2019s orders terminating C.W.\u2019s parental rights and entering an adoption decree serve the legislative dual purposes of protecting tribal relations and the best interests of the Indian child. As a result of the orders, Indian child T.A.W. is in an Indian home with his Indian natural mother and with an Indian stepfather with whom T.A.W. has bonded. As discussed above, in my view, the trial court\u2019s findings sufficiently cover any \u201cactive efforts\u201d inquiry and the majority\u2019s remand for further findings concerning \u201cactive efforts\u201d is not necessary.\n\u00b680 Implicit in the majority\u2019s decision is that more is required of the mother than was performed here. As discussed above, I disagree with that premise particularly in this case, where a protection order forbade contact of any type between the father and the mother and child. The correct approach is to leave the assessment of active efforts to the sound discretion of the trial judge, as both the ICWA and the WICWA direct, in light of the circumstances of the case.\nConclusion\n\u00b681 Both the ICWA and the WICWA vest discretion in the trial court to assess active efforts. In doing so, in my view, the trial court will take into account the particular circumstances of each case and will remain cognizant of the best interests of the Indian child. In my view, the trial court here did so. Remand for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s termination decision is not warranted on this basis. Accordingly, I dissent.\nSimilarly, the federal Indian Child Welfare Act provides, \u201cAny party seeking . . . termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u2019\u2019 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d) (emphasis added).\nSubsection (1)(a) of the noted statute addresses the Department of Social and Health Services\u2019 provision, pursuant to statute or contract, of \u201creasonably available and culturally appropriate preventive, remedial, or rehabilitative services\u2019\u2019 to the parent of an Indian child in a proceeding concerning placement, dependency, or termination of parental rights. RCW 13.38.040(1)(a).\nThe Iowa statute at issue provides in relevant part:\nA party seeking . . . termination of parental rights over an Indian child shall provide evidence to the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\nIowa Code \u00a7 232B.5(19); In re Interest of C.A.V., 787 N.W.2d 96, 103 (Iowa Ct. App. 2010). The Iowa statute further requires that \u201cactive efforts\u2019\u2019 be \u201cvigorous and concerted.\u2019\u2019 Iowa Code \u00a7 232B.5(19).\nC.B. testified that her tribe helped C.W. get into drug treatment, and that when she and C.W. first separated she took T.A.W. to C.W.\u2019s mother\u2019s house to visit with C.W. C.B. also later made a book containing photographs of T.A.W. from 2007 to 2011 and sent it to C.W. C.B. testified that she did so \u201c[b]ecause at the time I thought he wanted to be a dad.\u201d Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Mar. 31, 2014) at 60.\nThe protection order was issued by the Shoalwater Bay Tribal Court on September 12, 2012 and expressly ran through September 12, 2015. It prohibited \u201cany contact whatsoever, in person or though others, by phone, mail, e-mail, answering machine, or any means whatsoever, directly or indirectly,\u201d thereby ensuring that C.W. had no contact with C.B. and T.A.W. Ex. 10, at 2. In October 2012, C.W. moved the tribal court to modify the no contact order, but the resulting order directed that \u201cdefendant shall attend DV [domestic violence] prevention classes\u201d and that \u201cupon at least 6 months of DV classes/program defendant may petition [the tribal] court for rehearing on this matter.\u201d Ex. 12 (emphasis added). The October 2012 order did not alter the effect of the tribal court\u2019s September 2012 no contact order, and there is no evidence that C.W. met the prerequisite for revisiting the no contact order.\nSee In re Interest of D.S., 806 N.W.2d 458, 465 (Iowa Ct. App. 2011) (paramount concern in termination proceedings is the best interests of the child, and remains so even where ICWA applies); see also id. at 474 (in determining best interests, primary considerations are the child\u2019s safety, the best placement for furthering the long-term nurturing and growth of the child, and the physical, mental, and emotional condition and needs of the child); see also In re Interest of Pawling, 101 Wn.2d 392, 399, 679 P.2d 916 (1984) (in termination proceeding where rights of the parent and welfare of the child conflict, the best interests of the child must prevail).\nNotably, the problem that the ICWA was intended to address\u2014\u201cabusive child welfare practices\u2019\u2019 that removed Indian children from their homes and placed them in non-Indian homes\u2014is not present here.

        "text": "[As amended by order of the Supreme Court September 1, 2016.]\nYu, J.\n\u00b61 The question in this case is whether a third party\u2014here, a step-grandfather with no legally established relationship to his step-grandson\u2014can petition for visitation rights through a custody proceeding pursuant to chapter 26.10 RCW or under some equitable doctrine. Stated simply, does a right to third-party visitation exist under Washington law? We hold that it does not.\n\u00b62 Washington\u2019s third-party visitation statutes were invalidated as facially unconstitutional because they infringed on a parent\u2019s fundamental liberty interests. Unless and until the legislature amends chapter 26.10 RCW, there is no statutory basis for third-party visitation. Furthermore, we decline to recognize a right to petition for third-party visitation in equity. We therefore reverse and remand for dismissal and consideration of the award of attorney fees.\nFactual and Procedural History\n\u00b63 M.W.\u2019s parents died in a tragic car accident on August 9, 2008, just days before his first birthday. At that time, M.W. was in the physical custody of petitioners Greg and Linda Minium, M.W.\u2019s maternal grandparents. Approximately one month after the accident, the Miniums filed a petition in Cowlitz County Superior Court for nonparental custody of M.W. pursuant to RCW 26.10.030(1). Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 3-7. The petition named Patti Shmilenko, M.W.\u2019s paternal grandmother, as the sole respondent. Id. at 3. John Shmilenko, Mrs. Shmilenko\u2019s husband and M.W.\u2019s step-grandfather, was not named as a party. Mr. Shmil-enko did not attempt to intervene.\n\u00b64 In March 2010, the Miniums and Mrs. Shmilenko agreed to the entry of a nonparental custody decree establishing the Miniums as M.W.\u2019s legal custodians and granting visitation rights to Mrs. Shmilenko according to an agreed residential schedule. Id. at 15-20, 21-31. The findings of fact and conclusions of law, custody decree, and residential schedule were all entered as agreed orders, with no independent fact-finding by the trial court. Id. at 8-12, 15-18, 21-29. The residential schedule specified that the parties would review the visitation schedule when M.W. entered school. Id. at 22. The record is silent as to why Mr. Shmilenko was not included in the court\u2019s orders despite residing in the same household as his wife, but all of the orders explicitly provide for visitation with \u201cPatti Shmi-lenko.\u201d E.g., id. at 11, 16, 22-24. Mr. Shmilenko has maintained a relationship with M.W. through his wife\u2019s visitation rights.\n\u00b65 When M.W. reached school age three years later, the parties could not agree on a modified residential schedule. Mrs. Shmilenko subsequently petitioned the superior court to modify the original custody decree and residential schedule, naming both herself and her husband as \u201crequesting parties.\u201d Id. at 35 (capitalization omitted). Mrs. Shmilenko also moved for a temporary amended residential schedule. Id. at 49-52. In response, the Miniums asked the court to terminate Mrs. Shmilenko\u2019s visitation rights, contending that her court-ordered, third-party visitation was unconstitutional and that she also was not entitled to visitation under the equitable doctrine of de facto parentage. Id. at 54-59. In the alternative, the Miniums asked the court to order the parties to participate in mediation. Id. at 59.\n\u00b66 The court entered a temporary order on October 7, 2013, amending M.W.\u2019s residential schedule and allowing Mrs. Shmilenko to continue to exercise her own visitation rights pursuant to the parties\u2019 prior agreed order. Id. at 62-64. In the temporary order, the court did not rule on the Miniums\u2019 argument that third-party visitation is unconstitutional; it also crossed out a reference to Mr. Shmilenko as a \u201crequesting party\u201d and provided for visitation with Mrs. Shmilenko only. Id. at 63. Ultimately, the court entered a final order ensuring that Mrs. Shmilenko would continue to have midweek visits with M.W. during the school year, as well as other visitations during certain weekends, holidays, and vacations Id. at 250-51. The Miniums do not challenge the court\u2019s orders as to Mrs. Shmilenko\u2019s visitation rights. Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Opening Br. at 6 n.2.\n\u00b67 At the same time that Mrs. Shmilenko petitioned to modify the original custody decree, she also filed a motion pursuant to CR 21 to join her husband as an additional party to the underlying nonparental custody proceeding. CP at 44-46. The court denied that motion on October 28,2013, but indicated that Mr. Shmilenko would be permitted to state the factual basis for bringing his own third-party custody or de facto parentage action and, if he did bring such an action, it would be consolidated with Mrs. Shmilenko\u2019s petition to modify the custody decree. Id. at 66. The court also specifically interlineated a provision that Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s \u201caction would have to stand on its own merits.\u201d Id.\n\u00b68 A few weeks later, on November 14, 2013, Mr. Shmilenko proceeded to file his own nonparental \u201ccustody\u201d petition under a new cause number and requested that his petition be consolidated with the existing nonparental custody proceeding. Id. at 156-61. In his petition, Mr. Shmilenko did not request custody or decision-making authority with respect to M.W. Rather, he requested that the previously entered residential schedule be modified to explicitly give him visitation rights with M.W., stating that he had \u201cmaintained a grandparent-grandchild relationship with [M.W.],\u201d and asserting that it was \u201cin [M.W.] \u2019s best interest that JOHN SHMILENKO have established visitation that will continue even in the event PATTI SHMI-LENKO no longer is able to exercise visitation.\u201d Id. at 159-60. There is no indication in Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s petition that his wife\u2019s visitation rights were in jeopardy. The Miniums opposed the requested relief and argued that the petition should \u201cbe dismissed due to lack of adequate cause and as unconstitutional pursuant to ROW 26.10.160(3) and supporting case law.\u201d Id. at 166.\n\u00b69 The court heard oral argument regarding Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s petition on January 13, 2014, and concluded that there was no legal basis under chapter 26.10 RCW for the proceeding. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Jan. 13, 2014) at 14. Rather than dismiss the action at that point, the court allowed the matter to proceed under a de facto parentage framework and directed Mr. Shmilenko to file an amended petition. Id. at 15, 18. The court entered a written order and scheduled another hearing for February 24, 2014. CP at 108.\n\u00b610 At the February 24 hearing, the parties and the court all acknowledged the difficulty of trying to fit the facts of the present case into existing statutes or common law doctrine. In his arguments to the court regarding adequate cause, Mr. Shmilenko admitted that the de facto parent analysis was a \u201crough fit for this case,\u201d but nevertheless asserted that his amended petition reserved the right to seek visitation pursuant to the court\u2019s general equitable powers, even if he did not meet the specific requirements to establish de facto parentage. VRP (Feb. 24, 2014) at 5. Meanwhile, the Miniums contended that it would be impossible for Mr. Shmilenko to establish de facto parentage because \u201cJohn and Patti Shmilenko have always referred to themselves, both of them, in their relationship with [M.W.], as grandparent[al] in nature.\u201d Id. at 13. The court ultimately ruled that in light of the preexisting custody decree, a finding of adequate cause was necessary and proceeded to analyze the request for visitation under the four elements needed to establish de facto parentage. See id. at 27-28. The court ruled that the threshold requirement for a de facto parent claim\u2014that the natural or legal parent consented to and fostered a parent-like relationship between the child and the moving party\u2014did not apply because M.W.\u2019s biological parents were deceased and \u201cnobody here amounts to a natural or legal parent.\u201d Id. at 27.\n\u00b611 The court then found that allegations made in Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s petition were sufficient to establish adequate cause on the remaining three elements. Id. at 28. Specifically, the court ruled that because M.W. had overnight visits with the Shmilenkos, Mr. Shmilenko had sufficiently established that \u201c [t] he child and the moving party live together in the same household.\u201d Id. at 27. The court further found that even though the Miniums were M.W.\u2019s primary caregivers, Mr. Shmilenko sufficiently alleged that he was \u201cstill assuming aspects of parenthood\u201d and, therefore, established adequate cause for the requirement that \u201c[t]he moving party assumed obligations of parenthood without expectation of financial compensation.\u201d Id. Finally, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to establish adequate cause to believe that Mr. Shmilenko \u201chas been in a parental role for a length of time sufficient to establish with the child a bonded, dependent relationship parental in nature.\u201d Id. at 28. The court cautioned that it was ruling on adequate cause only, which would allow the de facto parentage action to move forward, but the factual allegations were \u201cobviously still to be tested.\u201d Id. Acknowledging that it was \u201cswimming well away from any established channel markers, legally,\u201d the court stated it would certify the issue for immediate interlocutory appeal. Id.\n\u00b612 On March 10, 2014, the court entered a written order formalizing its adequate cause ruling:\n2.4 DE FACTO PARENT STATUS\nThere is adequate cause to proceed with the De Facto Parent [claim] based on the following findings:\na. [M.W.] has no living parents that are able to consent to and foster a parent-like relationship as provided in Section 2.5;\nb. Respondent JOHN SHMILENKO and the child have lived together in the same household during all visitations as provided in Section 2.5.\nc. Respondent JOHN SHMILENKO has assumed the obligations of parenthood without expectation of financial compensation as provided in Section 2.5.\nd. Respondent JOHN SHMILENKO has fully and completely undertaken a permanent, unequivocal, committed and responsible parental role in the child\u2019s life as provided in Section 2.5.\n2.5 ADEQUATE CAUSE FINDING.\na. The Court finds that there is not adequate cause for Respondent JOHN SHMILENKO to move forward with a nonparental custody petition under RCW 26.10.\nb. The Court finds that Respondent JOHN SHMILENKO has established adequate cause to proceed under the equitable remedies of the court as a de facto parent and grants leave to allow the Respondent JOHN SHMI-LENKO to amend his nonparental custody petition to include a request for custody/visitation under the court\u2019s equitable powers.\nCP at 144-45. The court certified its ruling for immediate review under RAP 2.3(b)(4). Id. at 147. The Miniums sought discretionary review by this court, id. at 148, and the commissioner granted direct review pursuant to RAP 4.2(a)(3) and (4).\n\u00b613 The Miniums challenge Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s claim for visitation rights, asserting that there is no statutory basis for his petition because the third-party visitation statutes were held facially unconstitutional. Mr. Shmilenko contends that provisions in the statute governing nonparental custody proceedings, specifically RCW 26.10.030 and .040, provide an independent statutory basis for third-party visitation that does not come within the sweep of this court\u2019s precedent. In the alternative, Mr. Shmilenko asserts that if there is no statutory basis for third-party visitation, he may request relief under the court\u2019s equitable powers.\nAnalysis\n\u00b614 This court has repeatedly held that absent a valid statute, there is no right to third-party visitation under our existing laws. We invalidated Title 26 RCW\u2019s third-party visitation provisions, RCW 26.10.160(3) and RCW 26.09.240, as facially unconstitutional in In re Custody of Smith, 137 Wn.2d 1, 969 P.2d 21 (1998), aff\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 147 L. Ed. 2d 49 (2000) (plurality opinion), and In re Parentage of C.A.M.A., 154 Wn.2d 52, 109 P.3d 405 (2005). We determined that the sweeping scope of the third-party visitation provisions, which enabled any party to petition for third-party visitation rights at any time, \u201cimpermissibly interfere [d] with a parent\u2019s fundamental interest in the \u2018care, custody and companionship of the child.\u2019\u201d Smith, 137 Wn.2d at 21 (quoting In re Welfare of Sumey, 94 Wn.2d 757, 762, 621 P.2d 108 (1980)). We reaffirmed this holding in In re Parentage of L.B.:\n[O]ur recent decision in In re Parentage of C.A.M.A[.] makes clear that Washington\u2019s current third party visitation statutes are unconstitutional and inoperative and thus unavailable as an alternative ground on which to seek visitation.\n. . . [F]ollowing this court\u2019s holding in C.A.MA., it is clear that Washington\u2019s third party visitation statutes, RCW 26.09-.240 and RCW 26.10.160(3), are facially unconstitutional. The effect of holding a statute facially unconstitutional \u201cis to render the statute totally inoperative.\u201d City of Redmond v. Moore, 151 Wn.2d 664, 669, 91 P.3d 875 (2004). As such, based on our holdings in Smith and C.A.M.A., until the legislature amends the relevant statutes, there exists no statutory right to third party visitation in Washington.\n155 Wn.2d 679, 713-15, 122 P.3d 161 (2005) (emphasis added).\n\u00b615 In the intervening time since L.B., the legislature has abstained from amending the third-party visitation statutes to cure the constitutional defects. Despite our unwavering pronouncements and the legislature\u2019s refusal to amend the statute, we are now asked to determine whether a statutory right to third-party visitation may exist elsewhere in chapter 26.10 RCW. In the alternative, we are asked to use our equitable powers to create a third-party visitation right in the absence of a statutory remedy.\n\u00b616 We take this opportunity to reaffirm our previous holdings that there is no statutory basis for third-party visitation under our laws. Furthermore, we defer to the legislature\u2019s abstention from reinstating a statutory basis for third-party visitation, and we do not find a compelling reason now to create such a right under our equitable powers.\nA. Statutory Claim\n\u00b617 Recognizing that Washington\u2019s third-party visitation statutes have been invalidated, Mr. Shmilenko asserts that RCW 26.10.030 and .040 still provide a statutory basis for him to seek court-ordered visitation with M.W.\n\u00b618 RCW 26.10.030 sets forth the procedure for commencing a child custody proceeding:\n(1). . . [A] child custody proceeding is commenced in the superior court by a person other than a parent, by filing a petition seeking custody of the child in the county where the child is permanently resident or where the child is found, but only if the child is not in the physical custody of one of its parents or if the petitioner alleges that neither parent is a suitable custodian. . . .\n(2) Notice of a child custody proceeding shall be given to the child\u2019s parent, guardian and custodian, who may appear and be heard and may file a responsive pleading. The court may, upon a showing of good cause, permit the intervention of other interested parties.\n(3) The petitioner shall include in the petition the names of any adult members of the petitioner\u2019s household.\n\u00b619 RCW 26.10.040 states in relevant part:\n(1) In entering an order under this chapter, the court shall consider, approve, or make provision for:\n(a) Child custody, visitation, and the support of any child entitled to support.\n\u00b620 Mr. Shmilenko argues that \u201cRCW 26.10.030, as supplemented by RCW 26.10.040(l)(a), allows a trial court to award third party visitation where, as here, the child is in the custody of a non-natural parent.\u201d Br. of Resp\u2019t at 13. Not only does this interpretation seek to revive a right that we have determined no longer exists under our laws, it is contrary to the purpose and intent of the statute and inconsistent with the plain and unambiguous language of the provisions.\n1. The plain language of chapter 26.10 RCW does not provide a statutory basis for third-party visitation\n\u00b621 Mr. Shmilenko contends that together, RCW 26.10.030 and .040 provide an independent right to petition for third-party visitation. However, his analysis looks at the two provisions only in relation to one another, rather than considering both provisions within the context of chapter 26.10 RCW as a whole\u2014as the canons of statutory interpretation demand. See Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 10, 43 P.3d 4 (2002) (plain meaning can be determined by examining \u201cthe statute in which the provision at issue is found, as well as related statutes or other provisions of the same act in which the provision is found\u201d).\n\u00b622 By its own terms, chapter 26.10 RCW as a whole is concerned, first and foremost, with custody determinations. RCW 26.10.010 states that \u201c[i]t is the intent of the legislature to reenact and continue the law relating to third-party actions involving custody of minor children.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This clear and explicit statement of intent should guide analysis of the statute as a whole. See Oliver v. Harborview Med. Ctr., 94 Wn.2d 559, 565, 618 P.2d 76 (1980) (legislative declarations of policy \u201c \u2018serve as an important guide in determining the intended effect of the operative sections\u2019\u201d (quoting Hearst Corp. v. Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d 123, 128, 580 P.2d 246 (1978))).\n\u00b623 In the context of this clear legislative intent, Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s interpretation of RCW 26.10.030 and .040 is contrary to the plain language of the statute. RCW 26.10-.030 governs the commencement of nonparental custody proceedings and makes no mention of visitation for a third party. Conceding that RCW 26.10.030 refers only to custody, Mr. Shmilenko argues that RCW 26.10.040 \u201cmandates\u201d a broader definition of custody that includes \u201cvisitation by noncustodial third parties.\u201d Br. of Resp\u2019t at 10. However, RCW 26.10.040 plainly considers visitation only within the context of custody proceedings. The provision states that \u201cthe court shall consider, approve, or make provisions for: (a) [c]hild custody, visitation, and the support of any child entitled to support,\u201d RCW 26.10.040(l)(a) (emphasis added), enumerating visitation as one of the rights and responsibilities that a court is required to address when making a child custody determination. The mere mention of visitation in RCW 26.10.040 does not create an independent right to third-party visitation, and such an interpretation ignores the statute\u2019s plain language. Use of the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d requires that visitation be determined alongside custody. See Tesoro Ref. & Mktg. Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 164 Wn.2d 310, 319, 190 P.3d 28 (2008) (plurality opinion). In other words, RCW 26.10.040 dictates what a court must consider when making a custody determination, not what rights parties may petition for under the statute. Thus, RCW 26.10.040 cannot be reasonably construed to serve as a statutory basis for seeking third-party visitation outside of a custody proceeding.\n\u00b624 To support his statutory claim, Mr. Shmilenko points to the fact that none of the cases addressing the constitutionality of third-party visitation statutes touch on the validity of third-party visitation under RCW 26.10.030 or .040. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 11-13 (citing L.B., 155 Wn.2d 679; C.A.M.A., 154 Wn.2d 52; Smith, 137 Wn.2d 1). However, RCW 26.09.240 and RCW 26.10.160, were the only statutes in Title 26 RCW that expressly created a right to third-party visitation. Third-party visitation as it pertains to RCW 26.10.030 and .040 was not addressed in our previous cases because no such right is enumerated in either of these provisions. Judicial silence on the matter is not evidence to the contrary.\n\u00b625 It bears repeating that what our cases do say\u2014and say unequivocally\u2014is \u201cuntil the legislature amends the relevant statutes, there exists no statutory right to third party visitation in Washington.\u201d L.B., 155 Wn.2d at 714-15. While Mr. Shmilenko asserts this precedent is not controlling here because the cases dealt only with the third-party visitation statutes, the analysis above shows that there is no other statute that could provide an independent basis for third-party visitation. It is the province of the legislature\u2014 not this court\u2014to create such rights.\n2. Policy considerations\n\u00b626 When it affirmed the unconstitutionality of Washington\u2019s third-party visitation provisions, the United States Supreme Court observed that the language of RCW 26.10-.160(3) was \u201cbreathtakingly broad.\u201d Troxel, 530 U.S. at 67. The provision allowed \u201c[a]ny person\u201d to petition for court-ordered visitation with a child at \u201cany time.\u201d RCW 26.10-.160(3), invalidated by Smith, 137 Wn.2d 1. Reading a right to petition for third-party visitation into chapter 26.10 RCW, as Mr. Shmilenko urges, would have troubling and far-reaching consequences. Neither RCW 26.10.030 nor .040 would provide any protections against unwarranted intrusion or standards for determining when granting visitation is appropriate.\n\u00b627 First, RCW 26.10.040 provides no limitation on who would be able to petition for third-party visitation rights. The way in which Mr. Shmilenko interprets RCW 26.10.040 would allow any third-party to petition for visitation rights with a child. This is precisely the \u201cbreathtakingly broad\u201d scope that we were concerned with in Smith. Troxel, 530 U.S. at 67. We observed that the third-party visitation provisions\nlack other safeguards to prevent stable families from defending in court against frivolous petitions for visitation. Most notably the statutes do not require the petitioner to establish that he or she has a substantial relationship with the child. . . . Also, the statutes do not require the court to take into consideration such factors as the parents\u2019 reasons for restricting visitation with the petitioner or any allegations of past physical or mental abuse by petitioner when making a visitation determination.\nSmith, 137 Wn.2d at 20-21. That a natural or legal parent\u2019s rights are not involved here does not change the fact that nothing in the statute would prevent a distant or estranged relative, a complete stranger, or any other third party, for that matter, from petitioning for visitation.\n\u00b628 Further, there are no standards to guide courts in deciding whether to grant visitation. Recognizing a right to third-party visitation in the absence of a statute that sets forth protective requirements or standards would make our state an outlier, even among the jurisdictions that explicitly provide for third-party visitation. See Jeff Atkinson, Shifts in the Law Regarding the Rights of Third Parties to Seek Visitation and Custody of Children, 47 Fam. L.Q. 1, 3 (2013). A recent survey found:\nMost third-party visitation statutes list factors a court should consider when deciding whether to grant visitation. Common factors include: the amount and quality of contact between the child and the third party; the quality of the child\u2019s relationship with the parents; the effect of the relationship (or absence of relationship) between the child and the third party; the preferences of the child; the mental and physical health of all individuals involved; and a history of or threat of domestic violence or child abuse.\nId. Of the jurisdictions with operating third-party visitation statutes, a strong majority enumerate factors that must be addressed to determine whether visitation should be granted. See id., App. I at 18-24.\n\u00b629 Third-party visitation under RCW 26.10.030 and .040 would give no deference to the wishes of legal custodians like the Miniums. While they are not M.W.\u2019s legal parents, the Miniums have broad discretion to determine M.W.\u2019s upbringing as his legal custodians, see RCW 26.10-.170 (\u201cExcept as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing at the time of the custody decree, the custodian may determine the child\u2019s upbringing.\u201d), and have been granted sole decision-making authority with regard to M.W. CP at 27. We continue to recognize that \u201c[t]he family entity is the core element upon which modern civilization is founded. Traditionally, the integrity of the family unit has been zealously guarded by the courts. The safeguarding of familial bonds is an innate concomitant of the protective status accorded the family as a societal institution.\u201d Smith, 137 Wn.2d at 15. There is no reason that a child, like M.W., should lose the integrity and stability of his family structure solely because he is already in the unfortunate position of having lost his biological parents.\nB. Equitable Claim\n\u00b630 In the absence of a statutory remedy, Mr. Shmilenko asserts that we should provide him with a remedy in equity, invoking the equitable power that we exercised in L.B. to recognize the de facto parent doctrine. While we do not question the current viability of the de facto parent doctrine, it has no applicability in the present case.\n\u00b631 In L.B., we adopted a stringent test for establishing de facto parentage and stated that \u201cattaining such recognition should be no easy task.\u201d 155 Wn.2d at 712. To establish standing as a de facto parent, the following criteria must be satisfied:\n\u201c(1) the natural or legal parent consented to and fostered the parent-like relationship, (2) the petitioner and the child lived together in the same household, (3) the petitioner assumed obligations of parenthood without expectation of financial compensation, and (4) the petitioner has been in a parental role for a length of time sufficient to have established with the child a bonded, dependent relationship, parental in nature.\u201d\nId. at 708 (quoting In re Parentage of L.B., 121 Wn. App. 460, 487, 89 P.3d 271 (2004)). We further stated that \u201crecognition of a de facto parent is \u2018limited to those adults who have fully and completely undertaken a permanent, unequivocal, committed, and responsible parental role in the child\u2019s life.\u2019\u201d Id. (second emphasis added) (quoting C.E.W. v. D.E.W., 2004 ME 43, 845 A.2d 1146, 1152).\n\u00b632 Mr. Shmilenko would not be able to meet these strict requirements. Mr. Shmilenko himself characterizes his relationship with M.W. as one that is \u201c \u2018grandparent-like,\u2019 \u201d Br. of Resp\u2019t at 9, so it cannot be said that he has assumed the obligations of parenthood or established a bonded, dependent relationship that is parental in nature.\n\u00b633 Moreover, the fact that de facto parents stand \u201cin parity with biological and adoptive parents in our state,\u201d L.B., 155 Wn.2d at 710, illustrates the unsuitability of the de facto parent doctrine in this case. Amicus Legal Voice points out that if Mr. Shmilenko were to establish de facto parent status, he would become M.W.\u2019s only legal parent, with constitutionally protected rights superior to M.W.\u2019s legal custodians, the Miniums. Br. of Amicus Curiae Legal Voice at 11. This is an extraordinary remedy for a party who seeks only visitation rights.\n\u00b634 Mr. Shmilenko conceded at oral argument that he never wanted to establish himself as M.W.\u2019s de facto parent and was requesting only visitation rights. Wash. Supreme Court oral argument, In re Custody of M.W., No. 90072-8 (June 25, 2015), at 32 min., 40 sec., audio recording by TVW, Washington State\u2019s Public Affairs Network, http://www .tvw.org. The de facto parent claim was advanced only at the behest of the trial court. Admitting that the de facto parent doctrine is \u201ca rough fit for the case at bar,\u201d Br. of Resp\u2019t at 17, Mr. Shmilenko asks this court to recognize a right to third-party visitation under its equitable powers. The circumstances in this case do not warrant the fashioning of such an extraordinary remedy by this court.\n\u00b635 Mr. Shmilenko claims that here, as in L.B., he is without an adequate statutory remedy. We find this analogy unpersuasive. In L.B., the parties were in a same-sex domestic partnership when the child was conceived and had been raising the child together in a \u201ccoparenting\u201d arrangement. L.B., 155 Wn.2d at 682. When the child, L.B., was six years old, the parties \u201cended their relationship and an acrimonious spate of litigation over access to L.B. ensued.\u201d Id. One of the coparents was neither biologically nor legally related to L.B., and there was no statutory basis under which she could petition for parental rights. We therefore considered \u201cwhether, in the absence of a statutory remedy, the equitable power of our courts in domestic matters permits a remedy outside of the statutory scheme or, conversely, whether our state\u2019s relevant statutes provide the exclusive means of obtaining parental rights and responsibilities.\u201d Id. at 688.\n\u00b636 In determining whether it was appropriate to exercise our equitable powers in L.B., we observed that\nWashington courts have consistently invoked their equity powers and common law responsibility to respond to the needs of children and families in the face of changing realities. We have often done so in spite of legislative enactments that may have spoken to the area of the law, but did so incompletely.\nId. at 689. Recognizing that \u201cinevitably, in the field of familial relations, factual scenarios arise, which even after a strict statutory analysis remain unresolved, leaving deserving parties without any appropriate remedy,\u201d id. at 687, we adopted the de facto parent doctrine \u201cto fill the interstices that our current legislative enactment fails to cover,\u201d id. at 707. Mr. Shmilenko contends his situation similarly warrants an equitable remedy.\n\u00b637 However, the legislature had been \u201cconspicuously silent when it [came] to the rights of children like L.B., who are born into nontraditional families, including any interests they may have in maintaining their relationships with the members of the family unit in which they are raised.\u201d Id. at 694. The third-party visitation Mr. Shmilenko seeks is different\u2014it is a scenario that the legislature did expressly contemplate when it enacted third-party visitation statutes. As discussed above, those statutes were held facially unconstitutional 17 years ago. We have explicitly held that \u201cuntil the legislature amends the relevant statutes, there exists no statutory right to third party visitation in Washington.\u201d Id. at 714-15. And, presumably aware of our case law, the legislature has declined to amend the relevant statutes. Cf. City of Federal Way v. Koenig, 167 Wn.2d 341, 348, 217 P.3d 1172 (2009). This is not just a case of simple legislative silence, but of clear legislative abstention.\n\u00b638 We do not doubt or question the quality of Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s relationship with his step-grandson, but it is not the province of this court to step in and fashion a remedy where the legislature has clearly abstained from doing so. If third-party visitation is to be recognized in this state, it should be through the legislative process. Cf. Buchanan v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, 94 Wn.2d 508, 511, 617 P.2d 1004 (1980) (\u201cThe legislature, within constitutional constraints, is the body to make the policy decisions on this matter. The failure of the legislature to amend the statute in the 17 years since [our] decision was rendered convinces us that it was and is the policy of the legislature to concur in that result.\u201d). Consequently, we hold that Mr. Shmilenko does not have an equitable claim for third-party visitation.\nC. Attorney Fees\n\u00b639 The Miniums seek attorney fees under RCW 26.10.080, which authorizes this court to award attorney fees to a party for \u201cmaintaining or defending any proceeding under this chapter.\u201d Mr. Shmilenko argues against an award of attorney fees on the ground that his statutory claim for visitation was the only proceeding maintained under chapter 26.10 RCW, which was dismissed by the trial court. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 23. However, this argument ignores that Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s nonparental custody petition was consolidated with the underlying custody proceeding originally maintained by the Miniums, CP at 87-88, which was brought pursuant to RCW 26.10.030(1). Moreover, Mr. Shmilenko does not limit his briefing to the possibility of an equitable remedy\u2014he plainly urges this court to find a statutory basis for third-party visitation within chapter 26.10 RCW. See Br. of Resp\u2019t at 10-14. Consequently, there is an existing proceeding under chapter 26.10 RCW on which an award for attorney fees could be made.\n\u00b640 Our authority to award attorney fees is discretionary, and RCW 26.10.080 requires that the court \u201cbalance the needs of the party requesting fees against the other parties\u2019 ability to pay.\u201d In re Custody of Brown, 153 Wn.2d 646, 656, 105 P.3d 991 (2005). The Miniums have submitted a financial declaration consistent with RAP 18.1(c) asserting that due to the cost of defending against Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s de facto parent claim, their expenses now exceed their income by more than $2,000. Fin. Decl. of Pet\u2019rs at 4. Though claiming that the cost of litigation has been \u201cfinancially debilitating,\u201d Mr. Shmilenko refuses to disclose his financial information, John Shmilenko\u2019s Resp. to Fin. Decl. of Pet\u2019rs at 5, in violation of RAP 18.1(c). Without a financial declaration from Mr. Shmilenko, this court is unable to balance the financial needs of the parties as required by RCW 26.10.080. We therefore hold that the Miniums are entitled to attorney fees in the amount determined appropriate by the trial court on remand \u201cafter considering the financial resources of all parties.\u201d RCW 26.10.080.\nConclusion\n\u00b641 The ways in which modern families can be arranged are myriad. It is not uncommon for children to be in the care of relatives who may not be their legal parents\u2014these families are no less deserving of protection from unwanted intrusion. Allowing any third party to petition for visitation poses a serious threat to the stability of these nontraditional families. We sympathize with Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s desire to ensure a continued relationship with his step-grandson, but he is not M.W.\u2019s legal parent, guardian, or custodian. While he may care about his step-grandson very much, the statute, by design, limits the parties who can interfere in such an intimate part of a child\u2019s life. This result may seem harsh in the instant case, but Mr. Shmilenko seeks a right that does not exist under our laws.\n\u00b642 There is no statutory right to third-party visitation under our laws, and we decline to exercise our equitable powers to create such a right. Consequently, we reverse and remand for dismissal of Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s petition and the determination of attorney fees.\nJohnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, and Gordon McCloud, JJ., concur.\nM.W.\u2019s biological paternal grandfather, Richard Miller, also was not named in the petition. M.W. has an ongoing relationship with Mr. Miller pursuant to an informal agreement with the Miniums, Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Opening Br. at 4, which is not at issue in this case.\nThe four-part test for de facto parentage was established in In re Parentage of L.B., 155 Wn.2d 679, 708, 122 P.3d 161 (2005), and is discussed further below.\nThe Miniums assert that by failing to appeal the dismissal of his nonparental custody petition, Mr. Shmilenko waived his right to bring a statutory claim. Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Reply Br. at 2. However, the commissioner explicitly raised the statutory issue upon granting discretionary review, and the Miniums did not move to modify this ruling. Thus, the statutory issue is properly before us.\nThe fact that an individual is pursuing court-ordered, third-party visitation over the objection of the child\u2019s legal custodians, rather than the child\u2019s deceased parents, cannot be the basis for reinstating a cause of action that we have previously held facially unconstitutional.\nMr. Shmilenko farther contends that our cases are not controlling here because this case does not implicate the liberty interests of natural or legal parents. While this is true, the fact that a parent\u2019s liberty interests are not involved in this case does not change the analysis. The third-party visitation statutes have been struck down as facially unconstitutional, and therefore no such right exists regardless of the parties or interests involved. See Moore, 151 Wn.2d at 669 (\u201cThe remedy for holding a statute facially unconstitutional is to render the statute totally inoperative.\u2019\u2019).\nWhile the dissent is correct that RCW 26.10.030(2) limits intervention in custody proceedings to an \u201c \u2018interested party,\u2019 \u201d dissent at 830, the fact still remains that there is no statutory provision that would prevent any potentially interested party from seeking to intervene in the first place. We do not doubt the ability of judges to evaluate the appropriateness of intervention, but the statute as written provides no mechanism for protecting families from having to defend against unwarranted intervention at the outset. Furthermore, by characterizing the issue as a procedural matter, the dissent does not take into account the fact that there is no right to third-party visitation in Washington. Mr. Shmilenko seeks a right that has no statutory basis, and the dissent would recognize a remedy where none exists.\nThe dissent\u2019s assertion that M.W. will \u201close his family structure with his paternal grandparents, the Shmilenkos,\u2019\u2019 dissent at 831, is not supported by the facts. As previously noted, Mr. Shmilenko has sustained a relationship with M.W. through his wife\u2019s visitation rights pursuant to a prior agreed order with the Miniums. Only Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s right to petition for court-ordered visitation with M.W. is at issue here, and there is no indication that Mrs. Shmilenko\u2019s visitation rights will be curtailed.\nWe decided L.B. prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage in this state.\nThe Miniums moved to strike Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s response to their financial declaration as untimely, and Mr. Shmilenko moved to enlarge the time to file his response. The court passed those motions to the merits, and now denies the Miniums\u2019 motion and grants Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s.",

I write separately to emphasize that in my view because Mr. Shmilenko was not a party in the original custody proceeding that yielded the original order entered on March 23, 2010 establishing custody and visitation rights concerning M.W., Mr. Shmilenko may not subsequently intervene to modify that order to seek visitation.\n\u00b644 M.W.\u2019s maternal grandparents, Greg and Linda Minium, filed the noted petition for nonparental custody in Cowlitz County Superior Court, naming only M.W.\u2019s paternal grandmother, Patti Shmilenko, as the sole respondent. John Shmilenko was not named as a party, and he did not attempt to intervene. The Miniums brought the petition under RCW 26.10.030, which authorizes \u201ca child custody proceeding\u201d regarding a child \u201cnot in the physical custody of one of its parents\u201d to be \u201ccommenced in the superior court by a person other than a parent! ] by filing a petition seeking custody of the child\u201d in the county where the child resides or is found. RCW 26.10.030(1).

Further, RCW 26.10.040 provides in relevant part that when entering an order resulting from such proceeding, \u201cthe court shall consider, approve, or make provision for . . . [c]hild custody, visitation, and the support of [the] child.\u201d RCW 26.10-.040(l)(a). Accordingly, under these provisions, Mr. Shmil-enko\u2019s procedural opportunity to intervene was at the original RCW 26.10.030 custody proceeding, but he did not seek to do so. There is no statutory basis for Mr. Shmilenko, who is a nonparty to the 2010 custody decree, to intervene in a subsequent proceeding concerning modification of the original custody order.\n\u00b645 As for Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s consolidated RCW 26.10-.030(1) nonparent custody petition, which sought only visitation and not custody, I agree with the dissent\u2019s concession that \u201cone can commence a proceeding under RCW 26.10.030 only to seek custody, not visitation.\u201d Dissent at 825. I also agree with the majority that Mr. Shmilenko \u201cdoes not have an equitable claim for third-party visitation.\u201d Majority at 822. However, Mr. Shmilenko could have, but did not, intervene in the original proceedings solely for the purpose of requesting visitation. Because he did not, I concur that John Shmilenko\u2019s petition must be dismissed.\nModification of the 2010 custody decree and residential schedule was sought by Patti Shmilenko in 2013 under CR 4.1, RCW 26.09.181, .260, and .270, and RCW 26.26.130(7)(b), none of which provide for intervention in a modification proceeding by a nonparty.",

But I cannot agree when the majority prohibits anyone from intervening in a pending custody action in order to seek only visitation with the child instead of custody of the child. The unambiguous language of RCW 26.10.030 plainly allows intervention without limiting the purpose of the intervenor, whether for custody or visitation. Nor can I agree with the majority\u2019s reliance on assertions in cases that never cite or discuss RCW 26.10.030 and .040 to support the conclusion that these two sections cannot be interpreted to allow visitation to a third party.\nANALYSIS\n\u00b647 \u201cOur fundamental purpose in construing statutes is to ascertain and carry out the intent of the legislature.\u201d In re Marriage of Schneider, 173 Wn.2d 353, 363, 268 P.3d 215 (2011). \u201cWe determine legislative intent from the plain language enacted by the legislature, considering the text of the provision in question, the context of the statute in which the provision is found, related provisions, amendments to the provisions, and the statutory scheme as a whole.\u201d W. Plaza, LLC v. Tison, 184 Wn.2d 702, 708, 364 P.3d 76 (2015) (citing Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 9-12, 43 P.3d 4 (2002)). The plain language of RCW 26.10.030 and .040 provides that trial courts may allow interested parties to intervene in a pending custody petition to seek visitation with a child who has no living parents upon a showing of good cause.\n\u00b648 I begin with the language of the statutes. RCW 26.10.030 defines who may intervene in existing child custody proceedings:\n(1). . . [A] child custody proceeding is commenced in the superior court by a person other than a parent! ] by filing a petition seeking custody of the child in the county where the child is permanently resident or where the child is found, but only if the child is not in the physical custody of one of its parents or if the petitioner alleges that neither parent is a suitable custodian. . . .\n(2) Notice of a child custody proceeding shall be given to the child\u2019s parent, guardian and custodian, who may appear and be heard and may file a responsive pleading. The court may, upon a showing of good cause, permit the intervention of other interested, parties.\n(3) The petitioner shall include in the petition the names of any adult members of the petitioner\u2019s household.\n(Emphasis added.) When a statute is clear on its face, we look only to the wording of the statute. Ass\u2019n of Wash. Spirits & Wine Distribs. v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd., 182 Wn.2d 342, 351, 340 P.3d 849 (2015). Under the plain language of RCW 26.10.030(2), when a child custody proceeding is already commenced, the trial court has the discretion to permit \u201cother interested parties\u201d to join the proceeding upon a showing of good cause.\n\u00b649 RCW 26.10.040(1), in turn, directs the court entering an order under RCW 26.10.030 to \u201cconsider, approve, or make provision for: (a) [c]hild custody, visitation, and the support of any child entitled to support.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Reading RCW 26.10.030 and .040 together leads to the following sequence: a party seeking custody may file under section .030; the court may permit the intervention of \u201cother interested parties\u201d; and upon entering an order, the trial court must determine the propriety of ordering visitation. Placing Gregory and Linda Minium and Patti and John Shmilenko into this sequence, the Miniums commenced a custody petition; Mr. Shmilenko sought to intervene as an \u201cother interested partly]\u201d; and the trial court was willing to consider whether to allow Mr. Shmilenko visitation.\n\u00b650 This interpretation of the language of the statutory scheme is not only plain on its face, it is logical if not inescapable. In fact, when the Miniums filed this custody petition under RCW 26.10.030, Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 3, they named the Shmilenkos in the petition and acknowledged that the court should determine the Shmilenkos\u2019 visitation rights, CP at 5:\nClaims to custody or visitation.\nThe petitioners do not know of any other person who has physical custody of, or claims to have custody of the child. It is the petitioners\u2019 understanding however, that the paternal grandmother and the step-grandfather, John and Patti Shmilenko, would like to have court-ordered visitation.\n1.9 VISITATION.\nThe court shall determine what visitation rights on the part of the paternal grandmother and step-grandfather are in the best interests of the minor child.\n\u00b651 In short, custody proceedings are not \u201cwinner take all\u201d contests. One party becomes the primary custodian, and the other is usually granted visitation.\n\u00b652 This plain language reading is also supported by the other provisions of chapter 26.10 RCW. We consider \u201call that the Legislature has said in the statute and related statutes which disclose legislative intent about the provision in question\u201d when determining the meaning of the plain language. Campbell & Gwinn, 146 Wn.2d at 11. In this case, RCW 26.10.010 states that \u201c[i]t is the intent of the legislature to reenact and continue the law relating to third-party actions involving custody of minor children . . . .\u201d As noted above, the legislature made provisions under chapter 26.10 RCW for trial courts to join third parties to custody proceedings and make visitation determinations. Because the legislature authorized the trial court to make third-party visitation determinations in custody proceedings, the plain language of RCW 26.10.030 and .040 aligns with the legislative intent stated in RCW 26.10.010.\n\u00b653 Even a cursory review of chapter 26.10 RCW reveals that visitation is mentioned repeatedly throughout the chapter: RCW 26.10.070 (\u201cThe court may appoint an attorney to represent the interests of a minor or dependent child with respect to custody, support, and visitation.\u201d (emphasis added)), .090 (\u201cIf a party fails to comply with a provision of an order or temporary order of injunction, the obligation of the other party to make payments for support or to permit visitation is not suspended, but the party may move the court to grant an appropriate order.\u201d (emphasis added)), .120 (\u201cThe court may interview the child in chambers to ascertain the child\u2019s wishes as to his or her custodian and as to visitation privileges.\u201d (emphasis added)), .180 (\u201cA relative may bring civil action against any other relative who, with intent to deny access to a child by another relative of the child who has a right to physical custody of or visitation with the child, takes, entices, or conceals the child from that relative.\u201d (emphasis added)), .190(1) (\u201cThe court shall hear and review petitions for modifications of a parenting plan, custody order, visitation order, or other order governing the residence of a child, and conduct any proceedings concerning a relocation of the residence where the child resides a majority of the time, pursuant to chapter 26.09 RCW.\u201d (emphasis added)). These pervasive references to visitation persuasively demonstrate that the legislature considered visitation to be an important aspect of custody and contradict the majority\u2019s conclusory statement that RCW 26.10-.030 and .040 do not create any rights to third-party visitation.\nI. The majority\u2019s analysis\n\u00b654 The majority fails to acknowledge the provision of RCW 26.10.030(2) that the trial court may \u201cupon a showing of good cause, permit the intervention of other interested parties.\u201d The statute does not require that \u201cinterested parties\u201d seek custody. There is no reason that a person with a relationship with the child or children could not seek to intervene for the purpose of maintaining and deepening that relationship with the child. We cannot ignore the very language of a statute we are interpreting. We interpret statutes as a whole, giving effect to all language used. C.J.C. v. Corp. of Catholic Bishop of Yakima, 138 Wn.2d 699, 708, 985 P.2d 262 (1999); see also Campbell & Gwinn, 146 Wn.2d at 11. The majority\u2019s unwillingness to recognize the availability of intervention here results in an opinion that is flawed.\n\u00b655 The majority argues that our interpretation of the statute would allow \u201ca distant or estranged relative, a complete stranger, or any other third party\u201d to intervene in the action. Majority at 817. The majority underestimates the ability of our trial judges to recognize that a \u201ccomplete stranger\u201d is not an \u201cinterested\u201d party. The statute expressly gives the trial judge discretion when it recites that the trial court \u201cmay, upon a showing of good cause,\u201d permit intervention. RCW 26.10.030(2).\n\u00b656 This case illustrates the very situation in which a court should allow intervention. The parents of M.W. were both killed in a tragic accident. Neither set of grandparents has an inherently superior claim to the other. Regardless of which grandparents are given custody, the other grandparents should be given visitation rights. The majority never explains why denial of visitation promotes public policy.\n\u00b657 The majority protests that \u201cthere are no standards to guide courts in deciding whether to grant visitation.\u201d Majority at 817. This is a nonissue; the guiding standard for all child custody and visitation decisions is the well-known \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard. RCW 26.09.002. We readily adopted this standard when we created the de facto parent doctrine. In re Parentage of L.B., 155 Wn.2d 679, 707, 122 P.3d 161 (2005) (recognizing \u201cthe clear legislative intent that permeates this field of law\u2014to effectuate the best interests of the child in the face of differing notions of family and to provide certain and needed economical and psychological support and nurturing to the children of our state\u201d). The best interests of the child provides a workable standard for third-party visitation by grandparents, just as it does for de facto parents.\n\u00b658 The majority worries that allowing Mr. Shmilenko to intervene to seek visitation will encourage \u201cunwarranted intrusion\u201d into M.W.\u2019s life. Majority at 816. Again, the majority ignores the protections of the statute: an interve-nor must be an \u201cinterested party,\u201d and visitation must be in the best interests of the child. And once a custody order is entered, an order can be modified only \u201cpursuant to chapter 26.09 RCW,\u201d RCW 26.10.190(1), which allows only minor modifications unless the court finds, \u201cupon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior decree or plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree or plan, that a substantial change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or the nonmoving party and that the modification is in the best interest of the child and is necessary to serve the best interests of the child.\u201d RCW 26.09-.260(1). There should be no fear of \u201cunwarranted intrusion.\u201d\n\u00b659 The majority argues that \u201c[t]here is no reason that a child, like M.W., should lose the integrity and stability of his family structure solely because he is already in the unfortunate position of having lost his biological parents.\u201d Majority at 818.1 agree, but this sword cuts both ways. Just as there is no reason that M.W. should lose his family structure with his maternal grandparents, the Miniums, so there is no reason M.W. should lose his family structure with his paternal grandparents, the Shmilenkos.\n\u00b660 Therefore, although the trial court initially denied the Shmilenkos\u2019 original motion, the court\u2019s subsequent order allowing Mr. Shmilenko to join the custody proceedings was proper under RCW 26.10.030 and .040. When Mrs. Shmilenko moved to modify her rights to visit with M.W. after he turned six years old, she also moved to permit Mr. Shmilenko to intervene in the existing custody proceeding, alleging that Mr. Shmilenko has a \u201cclose and loving grandparent [al] bond\u201d with M.W. and that he treats M.W. \u201cas if they were biologically related and is his own grandchild.\u201d CP at 44-46. Mrs. Shmilenko\u2019s motion supports the conclusion that Mr. Shmilenko had good cause to intervene as an interested party. In his own petition, Mr. Shmilenko simply asked for adjudication of his own rights, either through joinder or through consolidation. The trial court clearly believed that Mr. Shmilenko was an appropriate person to join to the custody proceeding\u2014the court said that it would join a separate petition by Mr. Shmilenko to the custody proceeding because that would be \u201cin the interest of justice and of the efficient adjudication of both matters.\u201d CP at 66.\nII. This plain language application of RCW 26.10.030 and .040 is not foreclosed by prior case law\n\u00b661 The majority states that \u201c \u2018until the legislature amends the relevant statutes, there exists no statutory right to third party visitation in Washington.\u2019 \u201d Majority at 816 (quoting In re Parentage of L.B., 155 Wn.2d at 714-15 (citing In re Parentage of C.A.M.A., 154 Wn.2d 52, 109 P.3d 405 (2005); In re Custody of Smith, 137 Wn.2d 1, 969 P.2d 21 (1998), aff\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 72-73, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 147 L. Ed. 2d 49 (2000) (plurality opinion))). However, neither L.B., 155 Wn.2d 679, C.A.M.A., 152 Wn.2d 52, nor Smith, 137 Wn.2d 1, considered the constitutionality of RCW 26.10.030 or .040 and, therefore, none of these cases preclude the trial court from joining Mr. Shmilenko to the custody proceeding to allow him to seek visitation.\n\u00b662 In Smith, this court held that RCW 26.10.160(3) and RCW 26.09.240 unconstitutionally permit third parties to petition for custody or visitation of the child of a parent who is fit to raise his or her child. 137 Wn.2d at 21. RCW 26.10.160(3) provides that \u201c[a]ny person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time including, but not limited to, custody proceedings\u201d and that the court \u201cmay order visitation rights for any person when visitation may serve the best interest of the child. . . .\u201d We held in Smith that subsection .160(3) \u201cimpermissibly interfered] with a parent\u2019s fundamental interest in the \u2018care, custody and companionship of the child,\u2019\u201d Smith, 137 Wn.2d at 21 (emphasis added) (quoting In re Welfare of Sumey, 94 Wn.2d 757, 762, 621 P.2d 108 (1980)), because \u201cthe standard of \u2018best interest of the child\u2019 is insufficient to serve as a compelling state interest overruling a parent\u2019s fundamental rights,\u201d id. at 20. When the United States Supreme Court reviewed Smith and examined the underlying statute, it stated that RCW 26.10.160(3) was unconstitutional \u201cas applied in this case\u201d for the same reason\u2014the statute interfered with the parent\u2019s \u201cfundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her two daughters.\u201d Troxel, 530 U.S. at 72, 73 (emphasis added). Smith is not a barrier to Mr. Shmilenko\u2019s request for visitation because he is not proceeding under RCW 26.10.160, which was declared unconstitutional in Smith, but under RCW 26.10.030 and .040.\n\u00b663 Similarly, in L.B., we stated that Smith had held RCW 26.10.160(3) facially unconstitutional, citing C.A.M.A., 154 Wn.2d at 61. See L.B., 155 Wn.2d at 713-14. But C.A.M.A. dealt only with RCW 26.09.240, RCW 26.10.160(3)\u2019s analogue for dissolution proceedings; the opinion never mentioned RCW 26.10.160(3)\u2014or any other provision in chapter 26.10 RCW, for that matter. And as in Smith and Troxel, our constitutional analyses in C.A.M.A. and L.B. emphasized that the visitation statutes were unconstitutional in cases where a \u201cfit parent\u201d objects to a nonparent\u2019s visitation request. C.A.M.A., 154 Wn.2d at 68; L.B., 155 Wn.2d at 714. L.B. itself implicitly recognized both of these limitations of C.A.M.A.:\nThis court held [in C.A.M.A.] that in order to comply with the Smith requirement that harm to the child must be demonstrated to order visitation over the objection of a fit parent, courts would be required to apply a \u201c \u2018harm to the child\u2019 standard\u201d as opposed to or in addition to the current \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard. Because we concluded in Smith that \u201cwe will not read qualifications into [a] statute which are not there,\u201d we invalidated RCW 26.09.240 in its entirety.\nL.B., 155 Wn.2d at 714 (emphasis added) (second alteration in original) (citations omitted) (quoting C.A.M.A., 154 Wn.2d at 68; Smith, 137 Wn.2d at 12). In other words, the statute would have to be rewritten in order for it to be constitutionally applied in cases where a fit parent objects to a visitation petition.\n\u00b664 L.B. and C.A.M.A. are no more of a barrier to Mr. Shmilenko than Smith\u2014neither case mentions RCW 26.10-.030 or .040. The broad language of L.B. quoted above by the majority\u2014\u201c \u2018Washington\u2019s current third party visitation statutes are unconstitutional and inoperative and thus unavailable as an alternative ground on which to seek visitation\u2019 \u201d (majority at 812) (quoting L.B., 155 Wn.2d at 713)\u2014is dictum as to statutes never mentioned in those cases, including RCW 26.10.030 and .040.\n\u00b665 In contrast to subsection .160(3), which allows \u201c[a]ny person\u201d to petition for court-ordered visitation \u201cat any time,\u201d section .030 protects the fundamental rights of parents by permitting petitions only when the child \u201cis not in the physical custody of one of its parents or if the petitioner alleges that neither parent is a suitable custodian.\u201d RCW 26.10.030(1). Neither this court nor the United States Supreme Court held\u2014and neither had any reason to consider\u2014that a visitation statute that does not infringe on a parent\u2019s fundamental rights is unconstitutional. Our decision in Smith and the supporting rationale for that decision do not preclude Mr. Shmilenko from filing a custody petition seeking visitation under section .030 where the child is in the custody of a nonparent.\n\u00b666 Further, our plain language interpretation of RCW 26.10.030 and .040 does not expose persons who have been given lawful custody of a child to harassment and oppression through the filing of duplicative and meritless petitions for custody or visitation. As discussed above, the legislature wisely limited third-party custody actions. RCW 26.10.190(1) requires courts to \u201chear and review petitions for modifications of\u201d residential orders \u201cpursuant to chapter 26.09 RCW\u2019; in such cases\u2014including M.W.\u2019s\u2014RCW 26.09.260 limits the circumstances under which the court may modify an existing residential schedule:\n[T]he court shall not modify a prior custody decree or a parenting plan unless it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior decree or plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree or plan, that a substantial change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or the nonmoving paHy and that the modification is in the best interest of the child and is necessary to serve the best interests of the child.\nRCW 26.09.260(1) (emphasis added). Section .260 adequately restricts modifications to those necessary to accommodate a substantial change in circumstances of the child or nonmoving party, which effectively removes any concern about the prospect of duplicative and meritless petitions for custody or visitation. This is in addition to the safeguard of RCW 26.10.030(2), which gives the trial court discretion to grant or deny third-party intervention upon a showing of good cause.\n\u00b667 Even further, here, the parties recognize that beginning school constituted a substantial change in M.W.\u2019s circumstances\u2014section 3.2 of the agreed custody order explicitly stated that it would be \u201cappropriate to review the child\u2019s developmental stage and visitation issues at that time\u201d due to M.W.\u2019s enrollment in school. The custody agreement entered in 2010 reserved for later determination M.W.\u2019s visitation schedule for \u201c[a]ge 5 thereafter,\u201d and it probably would have been a practical impossibility to implement the 2010 visitation schedule after M.W. enrolled in school\u2014section 3.1 of the parenting plan specified that M.W. would visit with Mrs. Shmilenko on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.\u2014in other words, during normal school hours.\n\u00b668 Therefore, under an existing custody proceeding, Mr. Shmilenko properly asserted his claim to third-party visitation pursuant to RCW 26.10.030 and .040. Because Mr. Shmilenko has a statutory basis to assert a visitation claim and the trial court found that there was good cause for him to join, I would reverse the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\u00b669 For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\nGonz\u00e1lez, J., concurs with Wiggins, J.\nAfter modification, further reconsideration denied September 7, 2016.\nBy contrast, RCW 26.10.160(3)permits anyone to petition for visitation rights with a child whether or not there has been a change in circumstances. We declared RCW 26.10.160(3) unconstitutional in Smith because it permitted this virtually unlimited right to file a petition for visitation. 137 Wn.2d at 21 (subsection .160(3) \u201cimpermissibly interfere[s] with a parent\u2019s fundamental interest in the \u2018care, custody and companionship of the child\u2019.\" (quoting Sumey, 94 Wn.2d at 762)).",

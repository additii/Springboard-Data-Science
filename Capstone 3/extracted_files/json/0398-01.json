        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b61 Retired Justices Robert Utter and Faith Ireland (plaintiffs) sued the Building Industry Association of Washington (BIAW), alleging that BIAW violated Washington\u2019s Fair Campaign Practices Act (FCPA), chapter 42.17A RCW, in part by failing to register as a political committee during the 2007-2008 campaign season. The trial court granted BIAW\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case on the ground that there was no material factual dispute and BIAW was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, but it denied BIAW\u2019s request for attorney fees. The Court of Appeals, following reconsideration, ultimately affirmed; it stated in dicta that there was an issue of fact as to whether BIAW met the statutory definition of a \u201cpolitical committee,\u201d but held only that the plaintiffs\u2019 case did not meet the procedural prerequisites to filing a citizen suit. Utter v. Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n of Wash., 176 Wn. App. 646, 672-73, 310 P.3d 829 (2013). The Court of Appeals also affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of BIAW\u2019s request for attorney fees. Id. at 674-77.\n\u00b62 The plaintiffs petitioned this court, and we accepted review. Utter v. Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n of Wash., 179 Wn.2d 1021, 336 P.3d 1165 (2014). The BIAW cross petitioned on the attorney fees claim, but we denied review. Id. We reverse the Court of Appeals and hold that (1) the plaintiffs\u2019 suit was not procedurally barred under our State\u2019s citizen suit provision and (2) the plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact about whether BIAW met the statutory definition of a \u201cpolitical committee.\u201d\nFACTS\n\u00b63 The nonprofit BIAW formed the for-profit BIAW Member Services Corporation (BIAW-MSC) in 1993. BIAW and BIAW-MSC share the same leadership \u2014 BIAW\u2019s president, vice president, first vice president, secretary, treasurer, and immediate vice president are also the officers of BIAW-MSC. BIAW and BIAW-MSC also share the same staff; they are paid by one organization or the other depending on the nature of their work.\n\u00b64 BIAW established BIAW-MSC largely to administer a \u201cretro program\u201d under rules established by the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 175. Under the retro program rules, members can pool their workers compensation risks and, at the end of the reporting period, obtain a refund if the actual claims add up to less than the expected claims. See RCW 51.18.010. L&\u00cd typically pays the refund to BIAW, the organization eligible to receive the refund, and then BIAW deposits the refund into the bank account of BIAW-MSC. A portion of the refund amount is eventually distributed to BIAW\u2019s local associations. BIAW calls its retro program the \u201cReturn on Industrial Insurance program\u201d (ROII).\n\u00b65 It is undisputed that in 2007, the ROII refund was much greater than anticipated. As a result, in 2007, BIAW, or BIAW-MSC (this is disputed), asked the local associations to pledge any refund amount in excess of their budget projections to aid in the upcoming governor\u2019s race. Ultimately, those funds were transferred to ChangePAC, a political action committee.\n\u00b66 On July 25, 2008, the plaintiffs sent a letter to the attorney general (AG) stating that the plaintiffs suspected BIAW and BIAW-MSC had each violated the FCPA by failing to register as a political committee and failing to report contributions and expenditures. The AG referred the complaint to the Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) that same day for investigation. The PDC investigation concluded that BIAW was not a political committee but that BIAW-MSC may have been. The AG sued BIAW-MSC, but not BIAW. BIAW-MSC settled.\n\u00b67 The plaintiffs then sued BIAW under the citizen suit provision of the FCPA, which permits citizens to file a \u201ccitizen action\u201d alleging violations of the act if they give notice of a violation in writing to the AG and the AG \u201cfail[s] to commence an action hereunder.\u201d RCW 42.17A.765(4)(a)(i). Plaintiffs alleged that BIAW violated the FCPA by failing to register as a political committee, by improperly coordinating expenditures with Dino Rossi (gubernatorial candidate in 2008), and by exceeding contribution limits. BIAW moved for summary judgment on several grounds. The trial court granted BIAW\u2019s motion without explaining its reasoning but denied BIAW\u2019s request for attorney fees under RCW 42.17A.765(4)(b). Plaintiffs appealed the grant of summary judgment only as to the political committee claim, and BIAW cross appealed the denial of attorney fees.\n\u00b68 The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in an unpublished opinion but then granted BIAW\u2019s motion for reconsideration. 176 Wn. App. 646. On reconsideration, in a published opinion, the Court of Appeals stated in dicta that the plaintiffs had raised an issue of fact sufficient to prevent summary judgment. Id. at 656. But the appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the case on a procedural ground. It explained that the PDC investigation into BIAW constituted an \u201caction\u201d by the AG under the citizen suit provision, thus precluding the plaintiffs from commencing their own \u201caction.\u201d Id. at 670-74. It also affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of BIAW\u2019s request for attorney fees. Id. at 674-77.\n\u00b69 Plaintiffs petitioned this court for review, and we granted it. 179 Wn.2d 1021. We denied BIAW\u2019s cross petition on the attorney fees issue. Id. There are thus only two issues before the court. The first question is whether the PDC investigation precludes plaintiffs from suing BIAW under the citizen suit provision. As discussed below, the answer to that question is no. We therefore also address the second question, that is, whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to BIAW on the political committee issue. The answer to that question is yes, because some aspects of the political committee issue present triable questions of fact.\nANALYSIS\nI. Standard of Review\n\u00b610 This case requires us to interpret several provisions of the FCPA. We review matters of statutory interpretation de novo. State v. Wentz, 149 Wn.2d 342, 346, 68 P.3d 282 (2003). The provisions of the FCPA, moreover, \u201cshall be liberally construed to promote complete disclosure of all information respecting the financing of political campaigns and lobbying, and the financial affairs of elected officials and candidates, and full access to public records so as to assure continuing public confidence of fairness of elections and governmental processes, and so as to assure that the public interest will be fully protected.\u201d RCW 42.17A.001.\n\u00b611 We likewise review a trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment de novo. Mohr v. Grantham, 172 Wn.2d 844, 859, 262 P.3d 490 (2011). In conducting this review, we view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id. Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif . . . there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Civil Rules (CR) 56(c).\nII. The Citizen Suit Provision\n\u00b612 A statute gives Washington citizens the right to sue for unfair campaign practices. But there is a prerequisite. The citizen must first give notice of a violation in writing to the AG; the citizen may then sue if the AG \u201cfailed to commence an action hereunder within forty-five days after the notice.\u201d RCW 42.17A.765(4)(a)(i). The Court of Appeals held that where the AG refers a complaint to the PDC for investigation after receiving such notice from a citizen, the referral itself counts as \u201c 'commenc[ing] an action.\u2019 \u201d Utter, 176 Wn. App. at 672-73 (quoting RCW 42.17A.765 (4)(a)(i)). Thus, according to the Court of Appeals, where the AG refers for investigation or investigates a complaint, the notice-giving citizen may not sue even if the AG declines to sue. Id.\n\u00b613 Our review involves statutory interpretation of RCW 42.17A.765. That statute is titled \u201cEnforcement.\u201d Its first three subsections define various ways the AG may enforce the fair campaign statutes:\n(1) The attorney general and the prosecuting authorities of political subdivisions of this state may bring civil actions in the name of the state for any appropriate civil remedy, including but not limited to the special remedies provided in RCW 42.17A.750.\n(2) The attorney general and the prosecuting authorities of political subdivisions of this state may investigate or cause to be investigated the activities of any person who there is reason to believe is or has been acting in violation of this chapter, and may require any such person or any other person reasonably believed to have information concerning the activities of such person to appear at a time and place designated ... to give such information under oath and to produce all... documents which may be relevant or material to any investigation authorized under this chapter.\n(3) When the attorney general or the prosecuting authority of any political subdivision of this state requires the attendance of any person to obtain such Information ..., he or she shall issue an order setting forth the time when and the place where attendance is required and shall cause the same to be delivered to or sent by registered mail to the person at least fourteen days before the date fixed for attendance. The order shall have the same force and effect as a subpoena ....\nRCW 42.17A.765 (emphasis added). Finally, subsection (4) provides a mechanism for citizen, as opposed to AG, enforcement:\nA person who has notified the attorney general and the prosecuting attorney in the county in which the violation occurred in writing that there is reason to believe that some provision of this chapter is being or has been violated may himself or herself bring in the name of the state any of the actions (hereinafter referred to as a citizen\u2019s action) authorized under this chapter.\nRCW 42.17A.765(4) (emphasis added). A \u201cperson\u201d may \u201cbring\u201d such a \u201ccitizen\u2019s action,\u201d however, only if \u201c[t]he attorney general and the prosecuting attorney have failed to commence an action hereunder within forty-five days after the notice.\u201d RCW 42.17A.765(4)(a)(i) (emphasis added).\n\u00b614 The Court of Appeals reasoned that subsections (2) and (3) above, permitting the AG to instigate an investigation and issue orders to facilitate the investigation, constituted \u201cactions . . . authorized under this chapter.\u201d RCW 42.17A.765(4). Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that if the AG refers a complaint for investigation, then it has not \u201cfailed to commence an action hereunder.\u201d RCW 42.17A-.765(4)(a)(i). In sum, therefore, if the AG merely investigates, the citizen cannot sue. Utter, 176 Wn. App. at 672-74.\n\u00b615 We must therefore decide what it means for the AG to \u201ccommence an action\u201d under RCW 42.17A.765(4)(a)(i). The Court of Appeals equates the word \u201caction\u201d in RCW 42.17A.765(4) with the investigatory enforcement mechanisms laid out in subsections (2) and (3). But only subsection (1) uses the word \u201cactions\u201d \u2014 it says, \u201cThe attorney general and the prosecuting authorities of political subdivisions of this state may bring civil actions . . . .\u201d RCW 42.17A.765(1). The other subsections refer to investigatory mechanisms the AG may use to enforce fair campaign laws and make no mention of \u201cactions.\u201d\n\u00b616 Moreover, the word \u201caction,\u201d as used in \u201cfailed to commence an action hereunder,\u201d RCW 42.17A.765(4)(a)(i), has a context. The introductory paragraph immediately preceding that phrase clearly grants citizens the right to \u201cbring in the name of the state any of the actions (hereinafter referred to as a citizen\u2019s action) authorized under this chapter.\u201d RCW 42.17A.765(4) (emphasis added). This sequencing suggests that \u201ccommencing] an action\u201d in subsection (4)(a)(i) refers back to the same type of action as the \u201ccitizen [\u2019s] action\u201d in subsection (4)(a) \u2014 the immediately preceding introductory paragraph using the word \u201caction.\u201d This sequencing also suggests that \u201ccommencing] an action\u201d in subsection (4)(a)(i) does not include the other nonaction enforcement steps available to the AG per the previous subsections \u2014 that is, \u201cinvestigating],\u201d RCW 42-.17A.765(2), \u201crequiring]\u201d a person to appear, id., or \u201cissuing] an order,\u201d RCW 42.17A.765(3).\n\u00b617 Further, as a matter of plain language, \u201can action\u201d and the phrase \u201ccommence an action\u201d are legal terms of art that mean \u201ca lawsuit\u201d or \u201cto sue.\u201d See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 35 (10th ed. 2014). In accordance with that plain meaning, the statute does not use the term \u201caction\u201d in isolation but refers to \u201cbringing],\u201d \u201cfiling],\u201d and, in the specific provision at issue, \u201ccommencing]\u201d an action. RCW 42.17A.765(1), (4), (5). \u201cCommence an action\u201d does not mean \u201cto investigate\u201d in ordinary legal terminology. See, e.g., Goldmark v. McKenna, 172 Wn.2d 568, 575, 259 P.3d 1095 (2011) (attorney general has power to commence actions); Waples v. Yi, 169 Wn.2d 152, 159, 234 P.3d 187 (2010) (action is \u201ccommence [d]\u201d by filing complaint (citing CR 3(a))); State v. Conte, 159 Wn.2d 797, 810, 154 P.3d 194 (2007) (discussing attorney general\u2019s power to \u201cbring an action\u201d); Whitney v. Buckner, 107 Wn.2d 861, 865, 734 P.2d 485 (1987) (right of access to courts includes right to \u201cbring\u201d or \u201ccommence\u201d \u201cactions\u201d); Berge v. Gorton, 88 Wn.2d 756, 761, 567 P.2d 187 (1977) (attorney general has power to \u201ccommence actions\u201d). The Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation is, thus, probably not what the voters intended.\n\u00b618 In addition, the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation causes absurd results. If subsections (2) and (3) are authorized \u201cactions\u201d under chapter 42.17A RCW, then they are also \u201ccitizen\u2019s actions.\u201d RCW 42.17A.765(4) (\u201cA person who has notified the [AG] may himself or herself bring in the name of the state any of the actions (hereinafter referred to as a citizen\u2019s action) authorized under this chapter.\u201d). Thus, under the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation, if the AG fails to act, a citizen could investigate on his or her own in the name of the State, personally issue orders with the same authority as a subpoena; require the appearance of other citizens to answer questions, and take all the other steps authorized by subsections (2) and (3) above for the AG. That is not a reasonable interpretation of the statute.\n\u00b619 The plaintiffs also argue that as a practical matter, the AG initially refers all complaints to the PDC for investigation. Thus, if the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation were correct, the PDC \u2014 a government agency \u2014 would unilaterally bar all citizen suits for violation of Title 42 RCW just by investigating. The voters cannot possibly have intended to create a citizen\u2019s right to sue when the government will not but allow the government to bar every one of those suits with a procedural quirk.\n\u00b620 BIAW argues, however, that there is a difference between a routine referral of a complaint and a case like this one, where the PDC conducts a substantial investigation and makes a recommendation to the AG regarding the merits of a case. BIAW thus asserts that a more formal investigation by the PDC constitutes an \u201caction\u201d under the statute, while a less formal investigation does not. BIAW offers no citation for this distinction, nor does it explain how to tell the difference between them.\n\u00b621 We decline BIAW\u2019s invitation to have the courts engage in an after-the-fact analysis of whether a particular investigation was thorough enough to qualify as an \u201caction,\u201d especially without established standards to help the courts make such a determination. Moreover, BIAW\u2019s interpretation would defeat the purpose of providing for citizen suits in the first place, because the AG likely declines to sue in exactly those instances where the PDC investigation concludes that no violation occurred. The statute is obviously based on the notion that the government may be wrong, and then it is up to citizens to expose the violation.\n\u00b622 Finally, BIAW argues that this court has held that the citizen suit provision was constitutional \u201cbecause it applied only in those instances where the state took \u2018no action,\u2019 investigatory or otherwise, at the end of the statutory notice periods.\u201d BIAW\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 10 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Fritz v. Gorton, 83 Wn.2d 275, 314, 517 P.2d 911 (1974)). Thus, BIAW argues, interpreting \u201caction\u201d here to exclude \u201cinvestigation\u201d renders the citizen suit provision unconstitutional.\n\u00b623 The cited case does not make the holding BIAW attributes to it. Instead, we said:\nIn our view, the qui tam provision of initiative section 40(4) poses no problem of constitutional dimension. We note respondents\u2019 assertion that they fear the threat of frivolous and unwarranted harassment suits. In this connection we can also note that should the suitor fail in his action the trial court, upon finding lack of reasonable cause, may reimburse the defendant for his costs and attorney\u2019s fees. In view of the current high costs of legal services, we regard this as no small deterrent against frivolous and harassing suits. Additionally, the plaintiff in such cases is required to give the Attorney General a 40-day notice of an alleged violation. The litigant may then proceed only after the service of a second 10-day notice results in no action on the part of the Attorney General.\nWe feel that these specified safeguards are ample protection against frivolous and abusive lawsuits. Should, however, the courts experience a significant number of palpably frivolous lawsuits, this court may not be without the tools to fashion a remedy within its rule-making powers.\nFritz, 83 Wn.2d at 314 (emphasis omitted). Thus, Fritz does not support BIAW\u2019s argument on this point.\n\u00b624 We hold that RCW 42.17A.765 precludes a citizen suit only where the AG or local prosecuting authorities bring a suit themselves, and it does not preclude a citizen suit where the AG declines to sue.\nIII. The Definition of \u201cPolitical Committee\u201d\n\u00b625 We next consider whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to BIAW. Specifically, we must decide if the plaintiffs have raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether BIAW fell within the statutory definition of a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d during the relevant time period. We hold that they have.\nA. Plaintiffs Have Raised a Genuine Issue of Material Fact about Whether BIAW Fell under Washington\u2019s Definition of a \u201cPolitical Committee\u201d during the 2007-2008 Campaign Season\n\u00b626 A \u201cpolitical committee\u201d is required to file a statement of organization with the PDC, RCW 42.17A.205(1), and make a variety of detailed disclosures. Id.; see also RCW 42.17A.235. The central issue here is whether BIAW (as opposed to BIAW-MSC) was a political committee and therefore violated the law by failing to file and disclose.\n\u00b627 RCW 42.17A.005(37) defines \u201cpolitical committee\u201d:\n\u201cPolitical committee\u201d means any person (except a candidate or an individual dealing with his or her own funds or property) having the expectation of receiving contributions or making expenditures in support of, or opposition to, any candidate or any ballot proposition.\n(Emphasis added.) Thus, under this statute, an entity becomes a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d with reporting requirements if it \u201cexpect [s]\u201d to \u201creceiv[e] contributions\u201d or \u201cmak[e] expenditures\u201d regarding .an upcoming election. Id. The statute does not say what proportion of the entity\u2019s purpose, if any, must be devoted to \u201cexpect [ed]\u201d expenditures to qualify as a political committee with reporting requirements. Id.\n\u00b628 To provide some background for our discussion of this definition and how it applies to this case, we begin by reviewing the few prior Washington decisions interpreting that statutory definition. This court has addressed the definition of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d in only one relevant case, State v. (1972) Dan J. Evans Campaign Comm., 86 Wn.2d 503, 546 P.2d 75 (1976). The relevant portion is only one paragraph, and since that paragraph represents almost all this court\u2019s jurisprudence on the issue, we quote it in full:\nIn the instant case, the Dan Evans Committee made a single contribution of $500 to the Early Birds Fund of the Washington Republican Central Committee, a political committee obligated to disclose the contribution. The record reflects no expenditures for the purpose of supporting or opposing a specific candidate or ballot proposition. No other contributions of a similar nature were made. There is no competent evidence in the record to indicate that the Dan Evans Committee solicited, received, or even had the expectation of receiving contributions to be used in support of or in opposition to candidates or ballot propositions. To require reporting and disclosure by the Dan Evans Committee or other persons who make a single contribution to a political committee under these circumstances (in the absence of other qualitative facts) would result in an unnecessary and unreasonable duplication and extension of the act\u2019s detailed and somewhat lengthy reporting requirements. Where the surrounding facts and circumstances indicate that the primary or one of the primary purposes of the person making the contribution is to affect, directly or indirectly, governmental decision making by supporting or opposing candidates or ballot propositions, then that person becomes a \u2018political committee\u2019 and is subject to the act\u2019s disclosure requirements. See Attorney General Opinion 1973, June 8, 1973. The primary purpose of the Dan Evans Committee was not to influence the political process by supporting or opposing candidates or ballot propositions through expenditures of its funds, but to pay for miscellaneous expenses incurred by Governor Evans and his staff in connection with his position as a public official. Plaintiff\u2019s contention to the contrary creates no material issue of fact.\nId. at 508-09 (some emphasis added). This discussion first uses the language \u201cthe primary or one of the primary purposes\u201d to describe what it takes to trigger reporting requirements based on election expenditures. Id. at 509 (emphasis added and omitted). But it actually concludes that the committee in that case lacked \u201cthe primary purpose[ ]\u201d of influencing an election without going on to address whether it also lacked a primary purpose of doing so. Id. (some emphasis added). Thus, although this case has been cited for adopting a looser \u201ca primary purpose\u201d test triggering filing and reporting requirements under the \u201cexpenditure\u201d prong of RCW 42.17A.005(37), rather than the more restrictive \u201cthe primary purpose\u201d test as the prerequisite, the case does not clearly express that as a holding.\n\u00b629 The Court of Appeals, however, has so held, in only one case (not counting the instant case). According to the Court of Appeals:\nThe Act sets forth two alternative prongs under which an individual or organization may become a political committee and subject to the Act\u2019s reporting requirements. \u201c \u2018Political committee\u2019 \u201d means any person . . . having the expectation of receiving contributions or making expenditures in support of, or opposition to, any candidate or any ballot proposition.\u201d RCW 42.17.020(33). Thus, a person or organization may become a political committee by either (1) expecting to receive or receiving contributions, or (2) expecting to make or making expenditures to further electoral political goals.\nState ex rel. Evergreen Freedom Found. v. Wash. Educ. Ass\u2019n, 111 Wn. App. 586, 598, 49 P.3d 894 (2002) (JEFF) (alteration in original). The EFF court then stated that according to this court in (1972) Dan J. Evans, an entity will not become a political committee with filing and disclosure requirements under the \u201cexpenditure\u201d prong unless it also has the support of a political candidate or initiative as the \u201c \u2018primary or one of the primary purposes.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 598-99 (quoting (1972) Dan J. Evans, 86 Wn.2d at 509).\n\u00b630 The parties make statutory and constitutional arguments about how to interpret, and to apply, these \u201cprimary purpose\u201d tests. As this summary shows, our prior precedent does not fully answer those questions. Clearly, though, an entity can meet the definition of a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d under either the \u201creceiving contributions\u201d or \u201cmaking expenditures\u201d portion of the statutory definition, plus whatever \u201cpurpose\u201d test might also be added on to that statutory definition. We address whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims survive under either the contribution prong or the expenditure prong of the statute, and we deal with the controversy over the \u201cpurpose\u201d test under the expenditure prong \u2014 the only prong under which BIAW raises it.\n1. Contribution Prong\n\u00b631 The Court of Appeals in this case stated that \u201cthe evidence does not create a genuine issue of material fact as to the contribution prong.\u201d Utter, 176 Wn. App. at 656. It explained, \u201cThe issue is whether BIAW or BIAW-MSC expected to receive and ultimately did receive the ... funds [contributions] from the local associations.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). It then concluded that because BIAW-MSC, not BIAW, ultimately received the contributions in its account and then disbursed them to a registered political committee, ChangePAC, there was no issue of fact as to whether BIAW expected to receive contributions. Id.\n\u00b632 But the contribution prong, as the Court of Appeals stated correctly earlier in its opinion, asks whether an organization \u201cexpects to receive or receives contributions toward electoral goals.\u201d Id. at 655 (emphasis added) (citing EFF, 111 Wn. App. at 599). Not whether it expects to receive and receives. That interpretation is in line with the statutory language: \u201c \u2018Political committee\u2019 means any person ... having the expectation of receiving contributions or making expenditures.\u201d RCW 42.17A.005(37). \u201cExpectation\u201d clearly applies to \u201ccontributions\u201d (and also \u201cexpenditures\u201d).\n\u00b633 The plaintiffs therefore have the better of the argument when they say that the ultimate disposition of the funds does not answer the contribution question; the expectation is what matters. And here, as plaintiffs explain, they have presented evidence tending to show that BIAW expected contributions.\n\u00b634 This is clear from the statutory definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d and the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence tending to show such \u201ccontributions.\u201d A \u201ccontribution\u201d is defined in part as a \u201cpledge,\u201d RCW 42.17A.005(13)(a)(i), and an organization must register as a political committee \u201cwithin two weeks after organization or within two weeks after the date the committee first has the expectation of receiving contributions or making expenditures in any election campaign, whichever is earlier.\u201d RCW 42.17A.205(1). The plaintiffs filed multiple contemporaneous documents soliciting pledges for \u201cBIAW\u201d as well as documents stating that pledges were made \u201cto BIAW.\u201d E.g., CP at 419, 432, 433, 435. This includes, for example, an e-mail from Daimon Doyle, then BIAW and BIAW-MSC president, dated March 12, 2007, stating, \u201cAttached are the following documents: the formal resolution (rossilution) that we will be asking our 15 locals to support as well as some talking points .... We . . . need to be extra careful... since Dino is not a declared candidate we can\u2019t raise money for him therefore all official references are for a \u201908 candidate for Governor.\u201d CP at 410. The \u201crossi-lution\u201d itself stated:\nWHEREAS BIAW is committing 100% of excess retro dollars to the 2008 gubernatorial election,\nWHEREAS participation of local associations is necessary for success,\nNOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT,\nThe following local associations pledge that all Retro Marketing Assistance funds received in 2007, beyond the amount budgeted for the year, will be sent to the BIAW and placed in the BIAW 2008 gubernatorial election account, to be used for efforts in the 2008 gubernatorial race.\nCP at 411. The plaintiffs also point to meeting minutes of local associations that appear to make pledges directly to BIAW. For example, \u201c[i]t was MSPU [motion, seconded, passed, unanimous] to give BIAW the excess of budgeted funds ... to help in the governor race in 2008.\u201d CP at 433. Numerous additional documents \u2014 e-mails, meeting minutes, agendas, and organizational resolutions \u2014 also state that \u201cBIAW\u201d is soliciting funds to support its candidate in the upcoming election. See generally CP at 410-55.\n\u00b635 The Court of Appeals and BIAW explain that this evidence does not prove anything about BIAW\u2019s intentions or expectations because \u201cBIAW submitted evidence that \u2018BIAW\u2019 was used generically to refer to BIAW-MSC, BIAW, or both.\u201d Utter, 176 Wn. App. at 656. Therefore, \u201c[t]he documents to which Utter and Ireland point fail to create an issue of fact.\u201d Id.\n\u00b636 BIAW\u2019s premise does not lead to its conclusion. Instead, the fact that \u201cBIAW\u201d could refer to either or both BIAW and BIAW-MSC means that the use of \u201cBIAW\u201d in the documents at issue does not clarify to which organization the documents refer. The admittedly dual meaning of \u201cBIAW\u201d means that two interpretations are possible. It leaves an open question of fact about which interpretation is correct in each context. The BIAW\u2019s officers\u2019 declarations explaining that BIAW was really asking the local organizations to pledge to ChangePAC, not BIAW, e.g., CP at 153, are not sufficient to support summary judgment in light of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, either. As the plaintiffs point out, the ultimate collection of the pledged funds and distribution to ChangePAC, which does seem to have been accomplished by BIAW-MSC, occurred after the date that the plaintiffs first filed their complaint with the AG\u2019s office. And, as noted above, the legal question is which organization had the expectation of receiving contributions. The ultimate acquisition of such funds may certainly be a fact relevant to determining whether an organization expected to receive funds; similarly, BIAW\u2019s practice of using \u201cBIAW\u201d to refer to both \u201cBIAW\u201d and \u201cBIAW-MSC\u201d is also a fact relevant to making that determination. But neither fact is dispositive, since BIAW itself acknowledges that \u201cBIAW\u201d sometimes really does mean just \u201cBIAW.\u201d\n\u00b637 Plaintiffs have established a genuine issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment on the contribution prong.\n2. Expenditure Prong\n\u00b638 BIAW argues that for plaintiffs to prove BIAW is a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d under the expenditure prong, plaintiffs must show that (1) BIAW made or expected to make expenditures in support of a candidate and (2) BIAW had \u201cthe primary purpose\u201d of supporting an election candidate or initiative. We deal with each argument in turn.\ni. There Is a Material Question of Fact about Whether BIAW (as Opposed to BIAW-MSC) Expended or Expected To Expend Funds\n\u00b639 The plaintiffs argue that BIAW, not BIAW-MSC, expected to and then actually made the expenditures at issue here. The plaintiffs point to the doubtful ownership of the ROII funds (For example, if BIAW receives the funds and then gives them to BIAW-MSC with the express purpose that BIAW-MSC spend them to help elect Dino Rossi, who is \u201cexpending\u201d those funds?). They also rely on a number of documents that BIAW filed with the PDC stating that BIAW was expending funds. For example, one typical document states that the \u201cBuilding Industry Assn of WA\u201d expended $233,648.89 to support candidate Dino Rossi. CP at 253.\n\u00b640 BIAW responds that this expenditure, and the other documented expenditures also listing \u201cBIAW\u201d as the entity expending funds, was really made by BIAW-MSC \u2014 but there was not enough room on the PDC forms to fill in the full name. BIAW further asserts that the PDC investigation found that it was BIAW-MSC that expended the funds, not BIAW, and. that that is dispositive.\n\u00b641 The Court of Appeals agreed with BIAW. It stated that most of the plaintiffs\u2019 documents did not create any issue of fact as to the expenditure prong, and it relied on the PDC report that formed the basis for the AG\u2019s decision not to sue BIAW. Utter, 176 Wn. App. at 658.\n\u00b642 The concurrence/dissent similarly argues, \u201cIn this circumstance, we should defer to the PDC\u2019s findings because of its expertise in this area, and particularly because of the PDC\u2019s fact-finding role, in which it weighed and evaluated conflicting evidence, in reaching its determination that only the BIAW subsidiary, BIAW-MSC, qualified as a political [sub]committee.\u201d Concurrence/dissent at 438. The concurrence/dissent also states that the PDC is \u201cthe agency created by and charged with enforcing the FCPA.\u201d Concurrence/dissent at 440.\n\u00b643 The Court of Appeals and the concurrence/ dissent err for three reasons: first, the PDC\u2019s legal conclusions here concern statutory interpretation of the FCPA, and we therefore apply de novo, not deferential, review; second, the PDC\u2019s factual conclusions about whether a set of documents definitively establishes BIAW\u2019s independence from BIAW-MSC is neither technical nor complex, so we need not defer; and third, the PDC\u2019s decision on this point was not an \u201cagency determination\u201d and thus once again, we do not defer.\n\u00b644 First, the PDC\u2019s conclusion that BIAW is not a political committee is based at least in part on its interpretation of the FCPA, a statute. \u201cWhere statutory construction is concerned, the error of law standard applies.\u201d Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 of Pend Oreille County v. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, 146 Wn.2d 778, 790, 51 P.3d 744 (2002) (citing RCW 34.05-.570(3)(d)). To apply this standard, \u201cthe court determines the meaning and purpose of a statute de novo, although in the case of an ambiguous statute which falls within the agency\u2019s expertise, the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is accorded great weight, provided it does not conflict with the statute.\u201d Id. (citing Postema v. Pollution Control Hr\u2019gs Bd., 142 Wn.2d 68, 77, 11 P.3d 726 (2000)). Because the FCPA is not ambiguous, we need not defer to the PDC\u2019s conclusion that BIAW was not a political committee in our de novo review.\n\u00b645 Second, we recognize that the PDC based its conclusion partly on an assessment of facts, but \u201csubstantial deference to agency views\u201d applies mainly to factual matters that are \u201ccomplex, technical, and close to the heart of the agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d Hillis v. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, 131 Wn.2d 373, 396, 932 P.2d 139 (1997). The question about the meaning of documents listing \u201cBIAW,\u201d not \u201cBIAW-MSC,\u201d is neither complex nor technical. The question before us\u2014 whether documents listing \u201cBIAW,\u201d not \u201cBIAW-MSC,\u201d as the entity that solicited and obtained pledges merely raises a material question of fact about whether they mean \u201cBIAW\u201d or \u201cBIAW-MSC\u201d \u2014 is even less complex or technical. The limited amount of technical knowledge required to evaluate these documents also militates against judicial deference.\n\u00b646 Finally, the PDC\u2019s investigation informing the AG of the beliefs of the PDC staff was not an agency determination to which courts must defer. It was a decision against taking action and against seeking a final determination. RCW 42.17A.755 states:\n(1) The commission may (a) determine whether an actual violation of this chapter has occurred; and (b) issue and enforce an appropriate order following such a determination.\n(2) The commission, in cases where it chooses to determine whether an actual violation has occurred, shall hold a hearing pursuant to the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, to make a determination. Any order that the commission issues under this section shall be pursuant to such a hearing.\n(3) In lieu of holding a hearing or issuing an order under this section, the commission may refer the matter to the attorney general or other enforcement agency as provided in RCW 42.17A.105.\n(6) An order issued by the commission under this section shall be subject to judicial review under the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW.\nThus, when the PDC chooses to determine if a violation occurred, it must either hold an official hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act or refer the matter to the AG in accordance with RCW 42.17A.105. RCW 42.17A.105(5), the only section relevant to the nondetermination at issue here, states that the PDC shall, \u201c[u]pon complaint or upon its own motion, investigate and report apparent violations of this chapter to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.\u201d A report concluding that the PDC does not believe any violation requires reporting or other agency action does not fall under any of the statutory categories that we could interpret as constituting an agency action.\n\u00b647 Indeed, as a practical matter, if the trial court can rely on the PDC\u2019s conclusions to grant summary judgment, the effect will be similar to the effect of holding that a PDC investigation alone precludes citizen suits. Such a holding would make citizen suits virtually impossible because it is precisely those situations where the PDC finds no violation occurred that the AG will likely refuse to sue. The Court of Appeals therefore erred when it deferred to the PDC report.\n\u00b648 Without deference to the PDC report, we are left with BIAW\u2019s argument that the actual expenditures all came from BIAW-MSC, not BIAW. But RCW 42.17A.205(1) states that a political committee must register \u201cwithin two weeks after the date the committee first has the expectation of . . . making expenditures in any election campaign.\u201d (Emphasis added.) And a political committee includes an organization \u201chaving the expectation of.. . making expenditures.\u201d RCW 42.17A.005(37). The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that BIAW, not BIAW-MSC, solicited pledges from its local associations and that those local associations pledged \u201cto BIAW,\u201d not BIAW-MSC or ChangePAC, raises a question of fact as to whether BIAW had an expectation of making political expenditures, regardless of who actually ended up expending the funds.\nii. We Endorse the \u201ca\u201d Primary Purpose Test and Hold That There Is a Material Question of Fact about Whether BIAW (as Opposed to BIAW-MSC) Satisfied That Test\na. The Reporting Statute Contains No \u201cPurpose\u201d Test At All; To Construe That Statute as Constitutional, We Must Infer \u201ca Primary Purpose\u201d Test\n\u00b649 RCW 42.17A.005(37) does not say anything about whether an entity will be treated as a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d even if influencing an election is a minor part of its mission. This is, however, an important First Amendment issue, and both parties seem to agree that some \u201cpurpose\u201d test must be, or has been, added on to the statute to construe it properly. U.S. Const, amend. I.\n\u00b650 In this case, the Court of Appeals described the applicable \u201cpurpose\u201d test as follows: \u201can organization must have as its primary purpose, or one of its primary purposes, to affect, directly or indirectly, governmental decision-making by supporting or opposing candidates or ballot propositions.\u201d Utter, 176 Wn. App. at 657 (emphasis added) (citing (1972) Dan J. Evans, 86 Wn.2d at 509). It explicitly declined to address BIAW\u2019s contention that this \u201cone of its primary purposes\u201d test violates the First Amendment. Id. at 654 n.4.\n\u00b651 The Court of Appeals correctly determined \u2014 in dicta \u2014 that the numerous statements made by BIAW officials and submitted as evidence by plaintiffs raised a question of fact as to whether a primary purpose of the BIAW was to elect Dino Rossi. But the evidence does not appear to raise a question of fact as to whether that was the primary purpose of BIAW \u2014 BIAW existed long before the 2007-2008 campaign season and has many other purposes. See, e.g., CP at 153 (declaration of Tom McCabe, former BIAW officer, stating that BIAW\u2019s main purposes are \u201cmembership and education\u201d). So we cannot resolve the issue of whether there is a question of fact without determining the correct test first.\n\u00b652 BIAW argues that permitting regulation based on a primary purpose of the entity being the support or opposition of a \u201ccandidate or . . . ballot proposition,\u201d RCW 42.17A.005(37), as opposed to the primary purpose of that entity, is unconstitutional under Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1976) (per curiam). Specifically, BIAW argues that defining \u201cpolitical committee\u201d to include organizations with \u201ca\u201d primary purpose of supporting a candidate rather than \u201cthe\u201d primary purpose of supporting a candidate violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution because it chills political speech. Plaintiffs, for their part, would also read some \u201cpurpose\u201d test into the statute \u2014 they cite the \u201ca\u201d primary purpose test first stated by this court in (1972) Dan J. Evans and then adopted by the Court of Appeals in EFF, in both cases without discussion of any constitutional implications. BIAW relies on a Fourth Circuit case adopting the \u201cthe primary purpose\u201d test to satisfy First Amendment concerns, N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 525 F.3d 274, 289 (4th Cir. 2008). BIAW\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 14-15. Plaintiffs point out, however, that the exact argument BIAW makes was rejected by the Ninth Circuit two years later in Human Life of Washington Inc. v. Brumsickle, 624 F.3d 990 (9th Cir. 2010). That case specifically addressed what it perceived as Washington\u2019s \u201ca primary purpose\u201d test and concluded it did not violate the First Amendment: \u201cWe disagree with Human Life\u2019s reading of Buckley, and we reject its invitation to adopt a bright-line rule prohibiting all regulation of groups with \u2018a\u2019 primary purpose of political advocacy.\u201d Id. at 1009. Brumsickle and Leake thus represent a circuit split on this issue.\n\u00b653 There is likely no question of fact about whether the primary purpose of BIAW is to support candidates or initiatives. Thus we must decide whether to expressly approve the purpose test we first enunciated, though arguably as dicta, and certainly without considering the constitutional implications, in (1972) Dan J. Evans \u2014 that the support of a candidate or initiative must be \u201cthe primary or one of the primary purposes\u201d of a person expending funds for the State to subject them to regulation as a political committee based on their expected expenditures. 86 Wn.2d at 509 (emphasis omitted).\n\u00b654 Seven circuits have addressed this question. Brumsickle, as noted above, considered the question in the context of Washington law. It applied the \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d standard of review mandated by Buckley, 424 U.S. at 16, and Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310, 366-67, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010), for evaluating the constitutionality of the campaign disclosure (as opposed to contribution or expenditure limit) statutes, ruled that there was a substantial relationship between Washington\u2019s \u201cinformational interest and its decision to impose disclosure requirements on organizations with a primary purpose of political advocacy,\u201d and approved of what it perceived as our \u201ca\u201d primary purpose test. Brumsickle, 624 F.3d at 1009-11. Brumsickle was followed by the First Circuit in National Organization for Marriage v. McKee, 649 F.3d 34, 59 (1st Cir. 2011). That court stated that endorsement of the \u201cthe\u201d primary purpose test could \u201c \u2018yield perverse results\u2019 \u201d because\n\u201ca small group with the major purpose of re-electing a Maine state representative that spends $1,500 for ads could be required to register as a [political action committee (PAC)]. But a mega-group that spends $1,500,000 to defeat the same candidate would not have to register because the defeat of that candidate could not be considered the corporation\u2019s major purpose.\u201d\nId. (quoting Nat\u2019l Org. for Marriage v. McKee, 723 F. Supp. 2d 245, 264 (D. Me. 2010)). The Seventh Circuit agreed with Brumsickle and McKee and held that state campaign disclosure laws are not overbroad for lacking \u201cthe major purpose\u201d test. Ctr. for Individual Freedom v. Madigan, 697 F.3d 464, 491 (7th Cir. 2012). And, most recently, the Second Circuit followed suit, stating, \u201cWe join the Circuits that have considered PAC definitions in this context after Citizens United and hold that the Constitution does not require disclosure regulatory statutes to be limited to groups having \u2018the major purpose\u2019 of nominating or electing a candidate.\u201d Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 758 F.3d 118, 136 (2d Cir. 2014). Thus, four of the seven circuits that have addressed the question have found that state disclosure requirements need not be limited to organizations with \u201cthe\u201d major (or primary) purpose of electioneering to comply with the First Amendment.\n\u00b655 The Eighth Circuit has not directly answered the question, but it has recognized the circuit split and appears to engage in a sort of balancing test. It has held that \u201cthe major purpose\u201d of an organization is an \u201cimportant consideration\u201d in determining the extent of permissible regulation. Iowa Right To Life Comm., Inc. v. Tooker, 111 F.3d 576, 592 (8th Cir. 2013). It also found, however, that some regulation is permissible without \u201c[the] major purpose\u201d test, depending on the type and extent of regulation. Id. at 594.\n\u00b656 The Fourth and Tenth Circuits have rejected state disclosure requirements that lack \u201cthe major purpose\u201d test. The Tenth Circuit, though, does not appear to distinguish between a test that uses \u201ca\u201d major purpose and one that uses \u201cthe\u201d major purpose. See Colo. Right To Life Comm., Inc. v. Coffman, 498 F.3d 1137, 1155 (10th Cir. 2007) (referring to legislation that used the phrase \u201ca major purpose\u201d as including \u201cthe very \u2018major purpose\u2019 test at issue\u201d). Thus it appears that only the Fourth Circuit has unequivocally rejected a state law that requires \u201ca\u201d primary purpose of electioneering rather than \u201cthe\u201d primary purpose to subject a campaigning entity to filing and disclosure requirements. Leake, 525 F.3d at 287 (\u201cthe importance the plaintiffs attach to the definite article is correct\u201d). Since Leake was decided, the First, Second, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits have rejected its reasoning.\n\u00b657 We agree with the majority of circuits that have addressed this issue. As discussed, the statutory definition of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d contains no limitation regarding the purpose of such a committee. Reading some stringent purpose requirement, like the \u201ca\u201d primary purpose test, into our statute is necessary to satisfy First Amendment concerns. Adopting the even more stringent \u201cthe\u201d primary purpose test, however, would likely contravene the intent of the voters to extend the reach of this state\u2019s filing and disclosure requirements as much as possible and is not necessary to satisfy the First Amendment. Brumsickle, 624 F.3d at 1009. Additionally, Washington courts have previously espoused an \u201ca\u201d primary purpose test. (1972) Dan J. Evans, 86 Wn.2d at 509; accord EFF, 111 Wn. App. at 598-99.\nb. Plaintiffs Have Raised a Genuine Issue of Fact under Washington\u2019s \u201ca\u201d Primary Purpose Test\n\u00b658 The plaintiffs have established a question of fact as to whether BIAW had the support of a candidate as one of its primary purposes during the 2007-2008 campaign season. For example, the plaintiffs submitted BIAW board of director meeting minutes stating that \u201cBIAW\u2019s number one priority this campaign season would be to help Rossi get elected.\u201d CP at 608. A letter from BIAW\u2019s 2008 president, Brad Spears, to BIAW members whose memberships were about to expire states that \u201cBIAW is putting forth the largest political effort in the entire history of the association \u2018to re-elect\u2019 Dino Rossi as governor.\u201d CP at 406. Minutes of a local association\u2019s directors\u2019 meeting state, \u201cOn behalf of BIAW, Brad Spears spoke to the Board [and] talked about how we have a Governor who is unfriendly to our industry ____BIAW has decided that with this scenario all of our efforts for the next two years need to be expended on electing a new Governor in 2008.\u201d CP at 418-19. Aad an issue of BIAW\u2019s newsletter, Building Insight, contains an article titled \u201cAn Open Letter to all [Master\u2019s Building Association (MBA)] Members from BIAW Senior Officers,\u201d which states:\nAs the Building Industry Association of Washington\u2019s (BIAW) 2008 Senior Officers, it is a pleasure and an honor to serve as the leaders of this great association. Our primary goal this year has been to unify BIAW members and local associations behind a coordinated, all out effort to elect Dino Rossi as Governor____ BIAW is running an aggressive and truthful campaign to elect Dino. It is our hope and desire that you will join us in this endeavor and encourage your local association (MBA of King and Snohomish Counties) to actively participate with us to achieve this goal.\nCP at 368 (emphasis added).\n\u00b659 BIAW argues that all the statements by BIAW officers about BIAW were in fact statements in their capacities as BIAW-MSC officers about BIAW-MSC. We discussed this argument above; it is an argument for the trier of fact. The BIAW officer declarations saying that BIAW\u2019s main purposes are \u201cmembership and education,\u201d CP at 153, are not sufficient to support a grant of summary judgment in light of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence.\nB. The Decision in WBBT Does Not Collaterally Estop BIAW from Denying That It Owns the Funds at Issue Here\n\u00b660 The parties argue about whether a recent case, In re Wash. Builders Benefit Tr., 173 Wn. App. 34, 45, 293 P.3d 1206 (WBBT), review denied, 177 Wn.2d 1018 (2013), conclusively proves that BIAW owned the ROII funds that were handled through BIAW-MSC\u2019s accounts. WBBT concerned a trust established by BIAW, the Washington Builders Benefit Trust, for the purpose of holding and investing the ROII funds BIAW got from L&I under its retro program. The WBBT case is extremely complicated and involved complaints by participants in the retro program that BIAW and BIAW-MSC, trustees of the trust, were \u201cretaining interest earned on deposited funds, commingling funds, and failing to provide statutorily required accountings\u201d as well as \u201cviolating] their fiduciary duties under the trust agreement in expending funds earmarked for marketing and promotion of the plan.\u201d Id. at 43. Part of the case involved determining what organizations controlled the funds that were supposed to go into the trust and when they controlled them. WBBT found, for example, that \u201c[i]n July of each year, the BIAW-Member Services Corporation transferred an additional 10 percent marketing assistance fee to its money marketing accounts, which fee was distributed to BIAW.\u201d Id. at 50-51.\n\u00b661 The plaintiffs argue that BIAW is collaterally estopped from denying it owns the funds at issue here because that issue was litigated in WBBT and BIAW lost. But, as BIAW points out, a prerequisite to application of collateral estoppel is that the identical issue was litigated. BIAW is correct that the issue in WBBT is not identical to the issue here: who controls funds for purposes of determining whether a trustee violated fiduciary duties or contractual obligations is not the same issue as who expended or expected to expend funds for political committee registration purposes. In addition, in the absence of collateral estoppel, plaintiffs cannot rely on WBBT to create an issue of fact any more than BIAW can rely on the PDC investigation to argue that there is no issue of fact.\nC. We Do Not Reach BIAW\u2019s Argument That Reporting Requirements for Political Committees Would Be Unconstitutionally Onerous as Applied to BIAW\n\u00b662 BIAW argues that the reporting requirements for political committees would be unconstitutionally onerous as applied to BIAW if it were considered a \u201cpolitical committee.\u201d\n\u00b663 As discussed above, BIAW is correct that political committee registration requirements are subject to \u201cexacting scrutiny.\u201d Brumsickle, 624 F.3d at 1005 (citing Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 366-67). Under exacting scrutiny, the question of whether any applicable registration requirements, as applied to BIAW during any relevant time period, would have resulted in an unconstitutionally onerous burden involves a strong factual component \u2014 it would require a court to address the specific reporting requirements and balance the burden of the disclosure requirements for the specific time period in that particular case against the government\u2019s interest in providing the public with campaign finance information. See id. at 1008, 1013. We do not have a sufficient factual record to determine whether any applicable reporting requirements as applied to BIAW at the relevant time would have been onerous or would have been substantially related to the government\u2019s interest, nor have the parties briefed this issue in depth. This constitutional issue is thus not ripe for review.\nD. The \u201cAttribution\u201d Statute Applies Only to Aggregate Contributions and Not to the Definition of \u201cPolitical Committee\u201d\n\u00b664 Plaintiffs argue that the FCPA permits automatic attribution of contributions or expenditures by one organization to a parent or controlling organization for purposes of defining a \u201cpolitical committee.\u201d BIAW argues that the FCPA permits such automatic \u201cattribution\u201d only for purposes of contribution limits and not for purposes of determining whether an organization has received contributions or made expenditures that require it to register as a political committee.\n\u00b665 The plaintiffs rely mainly on just one sentence from RCW 42.17A.455, which states, in relevant part:\nFor purposes of this chapter:\n... All contributions made by a person or political committee whose contribution or expenditure activity is financed, maintained, or controlled by a trade association, labor union, collective bargaining organization, or the local unit of a trade association, labor union, or collective bargaining organization are considered made by the trade association, labor union, collective bargaining organization, or local unit of a trade association, labor union, or collective bargaining organization.\nRCW 42.17A.455(2). The plaintiffs assert that this statute applies to the definition of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d \u2014 \u201cany person ... having the expectation of receiving contributions or making expenditures in support of, or opposition to, any candidate or any ballot proposition.\u201d RCW 42.17A.005(37). \u201c \u2018Expenditure\u2019 includes a . . . contribution.\u201d RCW 42.17A-.005(20). Thus, plaintiffs argue that since \u201c[a] 11 contributions made by a person or political committee whose contribution or expenditure activity is ... controlled by a trade association . . . are considered made by the trade association,\u201d RCW 42.17A.455(2), if BIAW-MSC made contributions or expenditures and plaintiffs show BIAW controlled BIAW-MSC, then all of BIAW-MSC\u2019s contributions or expenditures are automatically attributed to BIAW. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is largely based on the fact that RCW 42.17A.455 begins \u201c[f]or purposes of this chapter\u201d and the \u201cchapter\u201d is all of chapter 42.17A RCW. They point out that there is no good reason to apply this \u201cattribution\u201d statute only to contribution limits, except that it would be very inconvenient for the defendants.\n\u00b666 BIAW counters that the attribution statute does not apply to the definition of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d but only to limits on campaign contributions. BIAW points out that the statute at issue was created by a citizens\u2019 initiative 20 years after the definition of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d was codified (also as a result of a citizens\u2019 initiative) and that the text of the initiative in the voter\u2019s pamphlet gave no indication that the initiative was intended to expand registration obligations. Rather, BIAW argues, the initiative was labeled \u201cAN ACT Relating to the regulation of political contributions and campaign expenditures.\u201d Laws of 1993, ch. 2, \u00a7 1 (Initiative Measure No. 134, approved Nov. 3,1992). Part III of the initiative, where the attribution rule appears, is labeled \u201cCONTRIBUTIONS.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4. And the other sections in Part III address contribution limits, not reporting requirements. Further, BIAW argues that the legislation contains a statement of the voters\u2019 intent (which also appeared in the language of the initiative):\n(2) By limiting campaign contributions, the people intend to:\n(a) Ensure that individuals and interest groups have fair and equal opportunity to influence elective and governmental processes;\n(b) Reduce the influence of large organizational contributors; and\n(c) Restore public trust in governmental institutions and the electoral process.\nRCW 42.17A.400 (emphasis added).\n\u00b667 The Court of Appeals agreed with the BIAW that the attribution statute did not apply to the definition of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d but only to caps on campaign contributions. The Court of Appeals and BIAW rely heavily on American Legion Post No. 149 v. Department of Health, 164 Wn.2d 570, 192 P.3d 306 (2008), to reach this conclusion. In American Legion, this court ignored a statutory provision resulting from an initiative that stated that the statute applied to \u201c \u2018[t]his chapter.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 586-91 & n.7. But we held that the phrase did not mean what it said because \u201csuch a reading would eviscerate much of the [Smoking in Public Places] Act[, ch. 70.160 RCW,] and interfere with the express intent of the voters.\u201d Id. at 588-89. Those are strong words. And even so, there was a vigorous dissent signed by several justices arguing that \u201cthis chapter\u201d is entirely unambiguous. Id. at 637 (J.M. Johnson, J., dissenting). By contrast, applying the attribution statutes to the definition of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d would not eviscerate the FCPA or interfere with the express intent of the voters to \u201c(a) [e]nsure that individuals and interest groups have fair and equal opportunity to influence elective and governmental processes; (b) [r] educe the influence of large organizational contributors; and (c) [r]estore public trust in governmental institutions and the electoral process.\u201d RCW 42.17A.400(2).\n\u00b668 Nevertheless, the bulk of the textual analysis supports BIAW\u2019s argument. The initiative\u2019s statement of intent declares that the people intend to accomplish the goals of the initiative \u201c[b]y limiting campaign contributions.\u201d RCW 42.17A.400(2). The initiative itself contains no indication that it would impose expanded reporting requirements related to the definition of \u201cpolitical committee,\u201d and the sections surrounding the attribution section all relate to limits on making contributions.\n\u00b669 Further, a comparison of the definition of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d in RCW 42.17A.005(37) with the attribution rule in RCW 42.17A.455 reveals that the two statutes are difficult to reconcile if they are supposed to apply to each other. For example, a political committee has an expectation of \u201creceiving contributions or making expenditures,\u201d RCW 42.17A.005(37) (emphasis added), while a \u201ccontribution made by\u201d a person can be considered \u201cmade by\u201d a controlling entity under RCW 42.17A.455(2) (emphasis added). Political committees are defined by making expenditures, not making contributions. Cross-referencing is cumbersome, if not impossible. This favors BIAW\u2019s argument that the statutes were never intended to be read together.\n\u00b670 Finally, plaintiffs\u2019 proposed interpretation poses constitutional problems. As discussed above, Brumsickle upheld Washington\u2019s disclosure laws on the ground that they satisfy the First Amendment\u2019s exacting scrutiny test, which examines whether the law\u2019s requirements \u201care substantially related to a sufficiently important governmental interest.\u201d Brumsickle, 624 F.3d at 1005. Washington\u2019s disclosure laws are constitutional on their face because they serve an important government interest and use a narrowly tailored means that does not force overburdensome or duplicative reporting. Id. at 1013. If we interpret the second sentence of RCW 42.17A.455(2) \u2014 the attribution rule \u2014 to apply to the definition of \u201cpolitical committee,\u201d then that definition of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d is no longer narrowly tailored. A union or trade organization with \u201ca\u201d primary purpose of electioneering, which never received or expected election \u201ccontributions\u201d itself but did speak freely to its members about how to vote, could nevertheless become subject to the disclosure requirements. Such an application of the attribution statute would significantly broaden the definition of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d and thus would arguably flunk the First Amendment test under not just Brumsickle but also Buckley (on which Brumsickle is based).\n\u00b671 We construe statutes to avoid constitutional doubt. State v. Robinson, 153 Wn.2d 689, 693-94, 107 P.3d 90 (2005). This interpretive principle of constitutional avoidance mandates that we choose the interpretation of the attribution rule that limits its applicability to aggregation of contributions. That resolution avoids any constitutional problem and also comports with the stated intent of the voters and the statutory scheme as a whole.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b672 We (1) hold that the PDC\u2019s investigation did not preclude the plaintiffs\u2019 citizen suit because the AG\u2019s referral of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to the PDC did not \u201ccommence an action\u201d within the meaning of the citizen suit statute, (2) hold that the plaintiffs have presented evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the contribution prong of the \u201cpolitical committee\u201d definition, (3) adopt the version of the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test that includes organizations that have the support of a candidate or initiative as \u201cone of\u201d their primary purposes and hold that, consequently, the plaintiffs have presented evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the expenditure prong of the \u201cpolitical committee\u201d definition, (4) hold that the WBBT case does not collaterally estop BIAW from denying ownership of the funds at issue, (5) decline to reach the constitutional \u201conerous burden\u201d issue, which is not ripe for review, and (6) hold that the so-called \u201cattribution\u201d rule applies only to contribution limits and not to the determination of who is a \u201cpolitical committee.\u201d We reverse the Court of Appeals and remand this case for further proceedings in the superior court.\nJohnson, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Yu, JJ., and Johanson, J. Pro Tem., concur.\n\u201cIn the case of a citizen\u2019s action that is dismissed and that the court also finds was brought without reasonable cause, the court may order the person commencing the action to pay all costs of trial and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the defendant.\u201d RCW 42.17A.765(4)(b).\nSubsection (3) does contain the word \u201cactions,\u201d but it is used in a context irrelevant to this case: \u201cIn any case where the order is not enforced by the court according to its terms, the reasons for the court\u2019s actions shall be clearly stated in writing. . . .\u201d RCW 42.17A.765(3).\nThe statute at issue was created through the initiative process. We interpret initiatives according to the general rules of statutory construction. City of Spokane v. Taxpayers of City of Spokane, 111 Wn.2d 91, 97, 758 P.2d 480 (1988) (citing Hi-Starr, Inc. v. Liquor Control Bd., 106 Wn.2d 455, 460, 722 P.2d 808 (1986)).\nBIAW, in a brief responding to amici arguments, also argues that \u201ccommence an action\u201d must include \u201cinvestigation\u201d because otherwise citizens could sue even where the PDC pursues an administrative action based on an investigation of a citizen\u2019s complaint, as it is permitted to do under RCW 42.17A.755. BIAW argues it would be an absurd result to permit both a PDC administrative action and a citizen suit. First, the PDC in this case did not commence any action, administrative or judicial; thus, this question is not presented. Second, BIAW does not explain why that result is absurd. Through administrative enforcement, the PDC may issue orders requiring the respondent \u201cto cease and desist from the activity that constitutes a violation\u201d and \u201cmay assess a penalty in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars.\u201d RCW 42.17A.755C4) (emphasis added). The amounts at issue in a lawsuit are significantly higher. For example, BIAW-MSC settled the AG\u2019s suit against it for $584,000. When a citizen wins a suit under the FCPA, \u201cthe judgment awarded shall escheat to the state,\u201d less the citizen\u2019s costs and attorney fees. RCW 42.17A.765(4)(b). A PDC action thus serves as significantly less of a deterrent to illegal campaign practices.\nWe do not address the question of whether administrative action by the PDC against an entity would preclude a citizen suit, as discussed in note 2, supra.\nWe have held that the words \u201cin support of, or opposition to, any candidate\u201d in the statutory definition did not render the statute vague, but that holding is not relevant here. Voters Educ. Comm. v. Pub. Disclosure Comm\u2019n, 161 Wn.2d 470, 490, 166 P.3d 1174 (2007).\nSee, e.g.,Anthis v. Copland, 173 Wn.2d 752, 756, 270 P.3d 574 (2012) (statute subject to two reasonable interpretations is ambiguous).\nThe Court of Appeals found there was a factual question as to the expenditure prong based on BIAW\u2019s 2008 United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form, which stated that BIAW made political expenditures in the amount of $165,214. Utter, 176 Wn.2d at 659. BIAW argues that was simply a mistake and therefore does not create an issue of fact. The plaintiffs have, however, likely raised an issue of fact as to who made the expenditures based on BIAW\u2019s submissions to the PDC naming itself and not BIAW-MSC. Again, BIAW\u2019s argument that \u201cBIAW\u201d can refer to either entity or both entities seems to create, rather than resolve, the factual question. Also, BIAW\u2019s argument that its 2008 IRS form contained a clerical error might well be accepted by a fact finder but, in light of all the other evidence, it is not sufficient to support summary judgment.\nWhile the trial court in this case did not explain its reasoning, its summary judgment order states that it considered the PDC\u2019s \u201cExecutive Summary and Staff Analysis\u201d and the PDC\u2019s \u201cReport of Investigation.\u201d CP at 833.\nThe following organizations have submitted an amici briefing in support of BIAW\u2019s argument on this particular point: Washington State Labor Council, SEIU Healthcare 775NW, UFCW 21, Washington Education Association, SEIU Healthcare 1199NW, and SEIU Local 925.\nBIAW also contends that our court has acknowledged that the attribution statute was intended to apply to contribution limits, not to the determination of who is a \u201cpolitical committee.\u201d We did state that \u201c[ROW 42.17A.455] specifies a relationship between entities in which those entities are considered a single entity for purposes of campaign contribution limits.\u201d Edelman v. State ex rel. Pub. Disclosure Comm\u2019n, 152 Wn.2d 584, 590, 99 P.3d 386 (2004) (emphasis added). However, that statement was likely dicta \u2014 the court in Edelman was not presented with the question whether the attribution statute could apply outside the campaign contribution limits context.\nPlaintiffs briefly make the same argument about another \u201c[a]ttribution\u201d statute, RCW 42.17A.460. (Boldface omitted.) But that statute does not include the language \u201cfor the purposes of this chapter.\u201d Without that language, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is significantly less convincing than the one we rejected above, and we therefore reject that one as well.",

Nevertheless, in my view, neither reversal of summary judgment nor further proceedings are warranted in this case because the AG\u2019s commencement of a lawsuit against Building Industry Association of Washington\u2019s (BIAW) nonprofit arm precludes a further citizen suit against BIAW under RCW 42.17A.765(4)(a)(i) and because the PDC\u2019s determination resolves any fact question regarding BIAW\u2019s culpability. I would affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.\nDiscussion\n\u00b674 The Fair Campaign Practices Act (FCPA), chapter 42.17A RCW, imposes specified reporting obligations on \u201cpolitical committees,\u201d as defined by RCW 42.17A.005(37) (discussed below). The task of enforcing those campaign disclosure requirements falls primarily to the State. See, e.g., RCW 42.17A.755 (authorizing the PDC to investigate alleged violations, initiate administrative enforcement proceedings, and levy fines not to exceed $10,000), .750(2) (authorizing the PDC to refer violators for criminal prosecution), .765(l)-(3) (authorizing the AG and other prosecuting authorities to investigate and bring civil enforcement actions). The act also grants limited enforcement powers to citizens under the citizen suit provision, RCW 42.17A.765(4). That provision, however, precludes citizens from filing a civil lawsuit unless the \u201c[t]he attorney general and the prosecuting attorney have failed to commence an action hereunder\u201d and \u201chave in fact failed to bring such action\u201d within the statutory time periods. RCW 42.17A.765(4)(a)(i), (iii).\n\u00b675 The following relevant facts are undisputed. BIAW is a statewide nonprofit trade association representing the interests of local building association members. BIAW-Member Services Corporation (BIAW-MSC) is a wholly owned subsidiary of BIAW and is a for-profit corporation formed by BIAW in 1993 to run the Return on Industrial Insurance Program for BIAW members. BIAW and BIAW-MSC share the same staff and officers, and such personnel commonly refer to both entities by the generic shorthand \u201cBIAW.\u201d Following an \u201cexhaustive\u201d investigation by the PDC, prompted by plaintiffs\u2019 claims that BIAW and its subsidiary were violating the FCPA, the PDC issued a report finding only that a discrete portion of the funds handled by BIAW-MSC within the 2007-2008 election cycle fell within FCPA reporting requirements; the report otherwise exonerated the BIAW organization. Based on that report, the AG commenced suit against BIAW-MSC for violation of the FCPA. Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a citizen\u2019s suit against BIAW for violations of the FCPA. The trial court granted BIAW\u2019s summary judgment motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the plaintiffs\u2019 citizen suit is barred because the AG commenced \u201can action\u201d precluding a citizen suit when the AG forwarded the plaintiffs\u2019 letter to the PDC for investigation. Utter v. Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n of Wash., 176 Wn. App. 646, 674, 310 P.3d 829 (2013).\n\u00b676 The majority reverses the Court of Appeals and holds that \u201cRCW 42.17A.765 precludes a citizen suit only where the AG or local prosecuting authorities bring a suit themselves, and it does not preclude a citizen suit where the AG declines to sue.\u201d Majority at 412 (emphasis added). In so holding, the majority relies on the plain language of the citizen suit statute, which provides in relevant part \u201c[a] person ... may ... bring ... a citizen\u2019s action ... only if... [t]he attorney general and the prosecuting attorney have failed to commence an action hereunder within forty-five days after the [specified] notice.\u201d RCW 42.17A.765(4)(a)(i) (emphasis added); see also majority at 408. This provision \u201cseeks to give private citizens ... the right to enforce the Act only if the state has not acted.\u201d State ex rel. Evergreen Freedom Found. v. Wash. Educ. Ass\u2019n, 111 Wn. App. 586, 608, 49 P.3d 894 (2002) (EFF I) (emphasis added); see also State ex rel. Evergreen Freedom Found. v. Nat\u2019l Educ. Ass\u2019n, 119 Wn. App. 445, 453, 81 P.3d 911 (2003) (EFF II) (noting that the \u201cclear intent\u201d of the citizen\u2019s suit statute is that \u201cthe AG or county prosecutor\u2019s \u2018commencement of an action\u2019 within the prescribed time period precludes a citizen\u2019s action\u201d).\n\u00b677 Here, the AG did commence a timely lawsuit against BIAW, via its for-profit subsidiary. The AG filed that lawsuit on the basis of the PDC determination that BIAW-MSC qualified as a political committee and had failed to comply with the reporting requirements of the FCPA. Accordingly, the AG filed suit against the BIAW subsidiary that the PDC\u2019s investigation found to be culpable.\n\u00b678 In this circumstance, we should defer to the PDC\u2019s findings because of its expertise in this area and particularly because of the PDC\u2019s fact-finding role, in which it weighed and evaluated conflicting evidence, in reaching its determination that only the BIAW subsidiary, BIAW-MSC, qualified as a political committee. \u201c[Substantial judicial deference to agency views [is] appropriate when an agency determination is based heavily on factual matters, especially factual matters which are complex, technical, and close to the heart of the agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d Hillis v. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, 131 Wn.2d 373, 396, 932 P.2d 139 (1997). \u201c \u2018[I]t is well settled that due deference must be given to the specialized knowledge and expertise of an administrative agency.\u2019 \u201d Port of Seattle v.

Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 181 Wn.2d 622, 634-37, 334 P.3d 1100 (2014) (agency determination is not binding on this court, but its adjudicatory action is generally granted some deference; considerable deference given to interpretation by agency charged with enforcing statute; we accord deference to an interpretation of law in matters involving the agency\u2019s special knowledge and expertise); see also PT Air Watchers v. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, 179 Wn.2d 919, 925, 319 P.3d 23 (2014) (burden of demonstrating the invalidity of agency action is on the party asserting invalidity; this court affords deference to agency\u2019s interpretation of the law where agency has specialized expertise in dealing with such issues, but this court is not bound by an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute; board\u2019s order should be upheld unless we find that the board erroneously interpreted or applied the law or the board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence).\n\u00b679 Because the AG filed suit against the BIAW subsidiary determined by the PDC experts to be culpable, the plaintiffs cannot now file a citizen\u2019s suit against a different part of that same organization. Restated, because the AG has not \u201cfailed to commence a [timely] action\u201d against BIAW, via that organization\u2019s culpable subsidiary, the plaintiffs\u2019 citizen suit against the BIAW parent association is barred. RCW 42.17A.765(4)(a)(i); see also EFF I, 111 Wn. App. at 608; EFF II, 119 Wn. App. at 453. For this reason alone, summary judgment to BIAW should be affirmed.\n\u00b680 Even if the AG has not acted sufficiently against BIAW to bar suit under RCW 42.17A.765(4)(a)(i), we should nevertheless sustain the grant of summary judgment. I disagree with the majority\u2019s view that summary judgment is inappropriate because a fact question exists regarding whether BIAW qualified as a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d under the FCPA. Majority at 413. The majority holds that the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, which names \u201cBIAW\u201d as soliciting pledges from its local associations, raises a question of fact regarding whether BIAW had an expectation of receiving contributions and making political expenditures. Id. at 416- 19, 421-22. The majority\u2019s analysis relies on e-mails and local building associations\u2019 meeting minutes indicating that pledges were solicited for and made to \u201cBIAW.\u201d Id. at 417- 19.\n\u00b681 This is not a case where there has yet to be a weighing of evidence and determination of witnesses\u2019 credibility. Such determination and fact-finding has already been performed by the PDC, the agency created by and charged with enforcing the FCPA. See RCW 42.17A.100 (establishing the PDC), .105 (describing the duties of the PDC); see also EFF I, 111 Wn. App. at 606. The FCPA empowers the PDC to \u201cinvestigate ... apparent violations of [the FCPA]\u201d upon complaint or its own motion and to \u201c[e]nforce [the FCPA] according to the powers granted it by law.\u201d RCW 42.17A. 105(5), (8). Powers granted to the PDC include, but are not limited to, the authority to \u201c(a) determine whether an actual violation of this chapter has occurred; and (b) issue and enforce an appropriate order following such a determination.\u201d RCW 42.17A.755(1). In lieu of issuing such order, the PDC may refer the matter to the AG. RCW 42.17A.755(3).\n\u00b682 In its report, the PDC noted \u201cExamples of Solicitation by BIAW-MSC,\u201d which included e-mails and minutes from local builders associations. Clerk\u2019s Papers at 67 (emphasis added and omitted). The report explained, \u201cThe emails demonstrate that these [local] associations responded to BIAW-MSC solicitation and agreed to donate a portion of their Retro program refund for use in the 2008 Governor\u2019s campaign.\u201d Id. Excerpts from the report noted as follows:\nJoel White, Executive Officer of the Spokane Home Builders Association: Mr. White stated in part in his July 2, 2007 e-mail: \u201cOur Board of Directors authorized BIAW to keep any proceeds from the ROII program over the $275,000 we budgeted in 2007 to be used for the Governor\u2019s race in 2008 . . .\u201d\nBill Quehrn, Building Industry Association of Whatcom County: Mr. Quehrn stated in part in his July 11, 2007 e-mail: \u201cThe vote was to allow BIAW to withhold $10,000 for our current check . . . The enthusiasm over another shot at the governor\u2019s office by Dino was unanimously welcomed.\u201d\nId. (emphasis added and omitted) (alterations in original). The PDC report further noted:\nJeff Danks, Controller for the Master Builders Association of King & Snohomish Counties (MBA-K&S) confirmed in an e-mail:\n\u201cI was present at the board meeting when Mr. Doyle made his solicitation to the [MBA-K&S]. The [MBA-K&S] was asked to agree to give back to BIAW any amount for the 2007 ROII refund above what was originally expected and that money was to be used for the 2008 Governor\u2019s race.\u201d\nId. (emphasis added and omitted). The PDC report also gave an example of a local board minute entry stating:\nThe April 30,2007 Minutes of the MBA-K&S Board of Directors meeting state that BIAW President Daimon Doyle was in attendance and provided information about the 2007 Legislative Session. The minutes also state:\n\u201cDaimon then went on to explain the reason he was in attendance, which was to ask the Association to donate the excess proceeds of the ROII return to BIAWs election fund to support a gubernatorial candidate in 2008. He discussed fundraising for the upcoming election year 2008, and stated that the senior officers introduced a resolution asking each of the 15 locals to donate the excess retro funds beyond what they budgeted to the gubernatorial fund.\u201d\nId. (emphasis added and omitted).\n\u00b683 As can be seen, the PDC had before it the same type of evidence that the majority now says creates a fact question: e-mails and meeting minutes identifying \u201cBIAW\u201d as soliciting funds. But the PDC considered that evidence in context and as fact-finder weighed the evidence, determined the credibility of witnesses, and resolved the fact question in rendering its decision. The evidence supports the PDC\u2019s factual determinations, and there is no indication that the PDC misapplied any portion of the FCPA. We should defer to the PDC\u2019s determination that BIAW does not qualify as a political committee under the FCPA.\n\u00b684 Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s view that the PDC report does not warrant our deference under the circumstances of this case. First, the PDC report is properly before us for consideration. In conducting our de novo review of the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to BIAW, we consider the record that was before the trial court. Fraternal Order of Eagles, Tenino Aerie No. 564 v. Grand Aerie of Fraternal Order of Eagles, 148 Wn.2d 224, 253, 59 P.3d 655 (2002). Here, the PDC report was before the trial court without objection, it was argued by the parties during the summary judgment proceedings, and it was considered by the trial court in granting the summary judgment motion. Accordingly, it is proper for us to give due consideration to the PDC report.\n\u00b685 Next, the majority says that (1) we should not defer to the PDC report to the extent that the PDC is applying the FCPA, majority at 421, (2) the PDC\u2019s factual determination of the significance of the reference to \u201cBIAW\u201d in e-mails and other documents does not warrant deference because this is not a complex or technical inquiry, majority at 421, and (3) the PDC report was not an \u201cagency determination [or action] to which courts must defer.\u201d Majority at 421. I disagree.\n\u00b686 In my view, we should defer to the PDC report in this circumstance because there is no indication that the PDC in any way misapplied the FCPA. Nor is this a case in which the PDC failed to act or acted ultra vires. As noted, the FCPA grants the PDC authority to determine whether a violation of the FCPA has occurred and gives the PDC the option of holding a hearing regarding such determination or referring the matter to the AG. See RCW 42.17A.755(l)-(3). Here, the PDC referred the matter to the AG, who filed suit against the only entity that the PDC determined to be culpable, the BIAW subsidiary BIAW-MSC. This did not offend the FCPA and thus warrants our deference. See Schuh, 100 Wn.2d at 187 (reversing where trial and appellate court failed to give appropriate deference to agency expertise).\n\u00b687 I also disagree with the majority\u2019s view that the PDC\u2019s resolution of conflicting evidence in reaching its determination does not warrant our deference. The majority oversimplifies the fact inquiry at issue as involving only who is identified by the term \u201cBIAW\u201d appearing in e-mails and meeting minutes, contending that such inquiry is not complex or technical and does not involve any particular agency expertise. Majority at 421. The point here is that the PDC\u2019s determination involved analysis of revenue reports as well as the consideration of other evidence including declarations and \u201cinterviews under oath\u201d of organization personnel. See note 17, supra. That calculus, which involved the assessment of financial materials, credibility determinations, and the weighing of all such evidence, not only informed the PDC\u2019s determination of culpability as to BIAW-MSC only, but reaching that determination necessarily resolved the question of fact that the majority says is raised here by the reference to \u201cBIAW\u201d in the noted documents. Under these circumstances, we should defer to the PDC\u2019s factual determination. See Hillis, 131 Wn.2d at 396 (judicial deference to agency views is appropriate when an agency determination is based heavily on factual matters close to the heart of the agency\u2019s expertise).\n\u00b688 I also disagree with the majority\u2019s view that we can disregard the PDC report because it does not qualify as an \u201cagency action.\u201d Majority at 422. As discussed above, the PDC may determine violations of the FCPA and has the option of holding a hearing or referring the matter to the AG. See RCW 42.17A.755(l)-(3). The PDC pursued the latter option, and the AG filed suit against BIAW-MSC, all in compliance with the FCPA. Under the circumstances of this case, we should defer to the PDC report.\n\u00b689 In sum, as discussed, the findings and determinations contained in the PDC report required the PDC to weigh the evidence presented and draw on its expertise in reaching its conclusions. In doing so, the PDC determined that BIAW was not a political committee, but BIAW\u2019s for-profit subsidiary, BIAW-MSC, had engaged in conduct that ran afoul of the FCPA warranting referral to the AG for further action. The trial court considered the PDC report and apparently deferred to it in granting BIAW\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Such deference under the circumstances of this case was proper and should be echoed by this court as well. See Hillis, 131 Wn.2d at 396.\nConclusion\n\u00b690 The events in question that prompted the citizen inquiry in this case occurred the better part of a decade and two election cycles ago. One plaintiff is now deceased. The concern that prompted the citizen letter that started this process and the gravamen of the citizen complaint has been addressed. The citizen letter to the AG was answered by a thorough PDC investigation that otherwise exonerated BIAW, but found grounds for further action against BIAW-MSC, which the AG pursued and which BIAW-MSC settled. While a citizen suit in this case against the BIAW nonprofit association is not procedurally barred by the AG\u2019s action of forwarding the citizen inquiry to the PDC for consideration, the AG\u2019s subsequent filing of a lawsuit against BIAW\u2019s for-profit subsidiary renders an additional citizen suit against BIAW under RCW 42.17A.765(4) unavailable under the facts of this case. Additionally, the PDC determination of the factual question of BIAW\u2019s culpability in my view renders further citizen action to address that issue improper.\n\u00b692 It is time for the parties to move on. In this case, the system (i.e., the statutory scheme of the FCPA as interpreted and employed by the PDC and AG) has worked as intended. Concerned citizens notified the proper authorities about questionable election activity. The agency with expertise in this area investigated, determined culpability, and recommended litigation action to the AG, which the AG pursued, resulting in settlement and correction of the actions that prompted the citizen letter in the first place. In my view, further litigation in this matter is not warranted. Judicial economy compels that we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.\nBIAW-MSC manages and processes BIAW members\u2019 Department of Labor and Industries overpayment refunds, referred to as the ROII or \u201cretro\u201d program. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 175.\nPlaintiffs described the PDC\u2019s investigation to the trial court as \u201cexhaustive.\u201d CP at 215 (Pl.\u2019s Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. at 4).\nThe PDC concluded that \u201c[djuring 2006-June 2008, BIAW did not solicit or receive contributions to support or oppose candidates or ballot propositions, nor did it contribute to candidates or political committees or use its general treasury for other campaign-related expenditures.\u201d CP at 57 (emphasis omitted). The PDC further determined that \u201cthe solicitation, receipt, and retention of local association Retro program refunds by BIAW-MSC in the amount of $584,527.53\u201d for campaign purposes qualified BIAW-MSC as a political committee, triggering reporting requirements for the noted funds. CP at 59.\nThe FCPA defines \u201cpolitical committee\u201d as \u201cany person (except a candidate or an individual dealing with his or her own funds or property) having the expectation of receiving contributions or making expenditures in support of, or opposition to, any candidate or any ballot proposition.\u201d RCW 42.17A.005(37) (emphasis added).\nAlthough the e-mails and minute entries identified \u201cBIAW,\u201d the PDC concluded that the solicitations were in fact made by BIAW-MSC. See CP at 57,59,67, 69, 77. In so deciding, the PDC conducted \u201cinterviews under oath\u201d of BIAW and BIAW-MSC personnel, and additionally considered revenue reports of BIAW and BIAW-MSC and declarations by BIAW and BIAW-MSC officers, administrators, and staff. CP at 76.\nThe plaintiffs assert that the PDC investigation was \u201cflawed\u201d because the PDC \u201caccepted at face value\u201d BIAW\u2019s contention that BIAW-MSC, and not BIAW, controlled and handled the funds in question and solicited campaign contributions and made expenditures. Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Reply to Pet. for Review & Resp. to Cross-Pet. for Review at 5. But it is the PDC\u2019s role as fact-finder to weigh the evidence and make determinations as it did here. We defer to such factual determinations. See Hillis, 131 Wn.2d at 396.\nWhile the plaintiffs asserted to the trial court that the PDC had been duped and that the trial court was not bound by the \u201cPDC\u2019s exercise of prosecutorial discretion,\u201d there is no indication in the record that plaintiffs otherwise challenged the PDC report or objected to the report\u2019s admission and its consideration by the trial court. CP at 213. Plaintiffs first asserted that the PDC report was inadmissible in their reply brief to Division One. See Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. & Resp. to Cross-Appeal at 8. That is too late. State v. Chen, 178 Wn.2d 350, 358, 309 P.3d 410 (2013) (declining to address an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief); Cowiche Canyon Conservancy v. Bosley, 118 Wn.2d 801, 809, 828 P.2d 549 (1992) (issues first raised in reply are too late to warrant consideration).\nAs part of that settlement, BIAW-MSC, the for-profit subsidiary of BIAW, agreed to register as a political committee and file all campaign finance disclosure reports to the PDC concerning campaign contributions it received in 2007; it agreed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines, and it agreed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more without court intervention in the event of any FCPA violation through 2016.",

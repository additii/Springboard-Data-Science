        "text": "Wiggins, J.\n\u00b61 David Carson appeals his conviction on three counts of child molestation in the first degree. He argues on appeal that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney objected to a Petrich instruction proposed by the State. A defendant must overcome a heavy burden in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance; he must demonstrate that his attorney\u2019s performance was professionally deficient and that he suffered prejudice as a result. Carson satisfies neither prong of this standard.\n\u00b62 Defense counsel reasonably concluded that the proposed instruction\u2019s language, tailored as it is for use in single-count cases, would be confusing and potentially prejudicial in Carson\u2019s multicount case. Under these circumstances, Carson cannot establish deficient performance. Moreover, defense counsel\u2019s objection did not prejudice Carson because the prosecution\u2019s closing argument clearly elected the acts on which the State was relying. For these reasons, we affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nI. Factual Background\n\u00b63 In 2009, Carson, who was homeless at the time, moved into the home of his childhood friend Dustin Halbert. Halbert lived with his fianc\u00e9e, Tiffany Hagen, and her three children, including C.C., who had just turned five years old at the time Carson moved in. Carson watched the children during the day while Halbert and Hagen worked. Carson lived with the family for approximately one year and two months.\n\u00b64 Three months after Carson had moved out of the house, C.C. told Hagen that Carson \u201ctried to put his penis in [C.C.\u2019s] butt.\u201d Hagen called police. Thirteen days later, C.C. underwent a medical examination and was interviewed by child forensic interviewer Cornelia Thomas. The forensic interview lasted just over 40 minutes. A DVD (digital video disk) of the interview was introduced as an exhibit at Carson\u2019s trial. The jury viewed the video of the forensic interview three times: once during Thomas\u2019s testimony at trial and twice during its deliberations after sending requests for the video to the court.\n\u00b65 As recorded in the DVD, C.C. describes three separate incidents of sexual assault by Carson in some detail: one where Carson twisted C.C.\u2019s \u201cbusiness,\u201d C.C.\u2019s term for a penis; and two incidents where Carson attempted to put his \u201cbusiness\u201d in C.C.\u2019s \u201cbottom.\u201d According to C.C.\u2019s statements during the interview, Carson twisted C.C.\u2019s \u201cbusiness\u201d in a bathroom. C.C. also said that Carson attempted to put his \u201cbusiness\u201d in C.C.\u2019s \u201cbottom\u201d while they were in his \u201cmom\u2019s room,\u201d which he also referred to as his \u201cmom and dad\u2019s\u201d room. At some point during this assault, Carson put tape on C.C.\u2019s mouth and used zip ties to tie C.C.\u2019s hands behind his back. In the third incident that C.C. described, Carson attempted to put his \u201cbusiness\u201d into C.C.\u2019s \u201cbottom\u201d in C.C.\u2019s own room after making C.C. look at his Spider-Man blanket.\n\u00b66 The following month, Detective Thomas Catey interviewed Carson at the Pierce County Sheriff\u2019s Department headquarters. During the interview, Carson denied having any sexual contact with C.C. Carson claimed that the allegations were retaliation for Carson\u2019s moving out of their house and leaving them in a financial bind.\n\u00b67 The State charged Carson with one count of rape of a child in the first degree and one count of child molestation in the first degree. Eleven days before trial, the State filed an amended information charging three counts of child molestation in the first degree. Because C.C. never provided dates on which each event occurred, each count of the amended information specified a charging period covering the entire time that Carson lived in the same house as C.C.\u2014April 1, 2009 to May 31, 2010:\nThat DAVID WILLIAM CARSON, in the State of Washington, during the period between the 1st day of April, 2009 and the 31st day of May, 2010, did unlawfully and feloniously, being at least 36 months older than C C, have sexual contact with C C, who is less than 12 years old and not married to the defendant and not in a state registered domestic partnership with the defendant, contrary to RCW 9A[.]44[.]083, and against the peace and dignity of the State of Washington.\nII. Trial\n\u00b68 When he testified at trial, C.C. had difficulty recalling the specifics of each incident, often responding with \u201cI forgot\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d to questions from both attorneys. C.C. recalled a few particulars, such as Carson tying C.C.\u2019s hands and taping his mouth while they were in his parents\u2019 room, but C.C. was unable to confirm or recount most of the details he had described in his videotaped interview 18 months earlier. During his cross-examinations of C.C. and other state witnesses, defense counsel largely avoided questions that could elicit details of the specific incidents. When examining his own witnesses, defense counsel focused on Carson\u2019s background, Carson\u2019s responsibilities while he lived with Halbert and Hagen, and the witnesses\u2019 observations of C.C.\n\u00b69 The prosecution\u2019s closing argument focused exclusively on the three incidents that C.C. described in his videotaped interview. The prosecutor explicitly told the jury that those incidents were the only acts the State wished the jury to focus on for the purposes of its deliberations. The prosecutor then proceeded to walk the jury through the specifics of these three incidents, which correlated with the three described in C.C.\u2019s interview.\n\u00b610 In the defense\u2019s closing argument, defense counsel argued that the allegations were entirely fabricated. He argued that true sources of the allegations against Carson were Halbert and Hagen, who concocted the claims of sexual abuse as retaliation for Carson\u2019s leaving them in a financial bind. During the relatively short time that defense counsel spent discussing the specific allegations against Carson, he focused almost entirely on the video of C.C.\u2019s interview with Thomas and urged the jury to view the video. He argued that the allegations against his client were completely false, the by-product of coaching by C.C.\u2019s parents combined with embellishment by C.C. himself.\n\u00b611 Prior to closing arguments, the parties discussed the State\u2019s proposed Petrich instruction, which read:\nThe State alleges that the defendant committed acts of Child Molestation in the First Degree against C.C. on multiple occasions. To convict the defendant on any count of Child Molestation in the First Degree, one particular act of Child Molestation in the First Degree must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and you must unanimously agree as to which act has been proved. You need not unanimously agree that the defendant committed all the acts of Child Molestation in the First Degree.\n\u00b6 12 The possibility of a Petrich instruction had first been raised by the trial court the week before trial. Defense counsel had then suggested that the instruction might not be necessary because the evidence showed \u201cthree separate and distinct, identifiable acts.\u201d On the second day of trial, the parties discussed their proposed instructions with the court, including the State\u2019s Petrich instruction. Defense counsel argued that the instruction was unnecessary because the evidence pointed to \u201cthree separate and distinct incidents, one in [C.C.\u2019s] room, one in his mother\u2019s room, and one in the bathroom.\u201d Defense counsel argued that reading the Petrich instruction could cause jury confusion:\nI think [the Petrich instruction] can be confusing in a case where you have specific instances alleged, where three acts potentially are alleged . . . and three acts are charged. If you read that instruction, it confuses the jury into thinking, well, if you agree that one act happened, then you must agree that all of them happened. And that concerns me.\n\u00b613 The following day, after both parties rested, defense counsel specifically objected to the State\u2019s proposed Petrich instruction as confusing. The State responded that it had not elected to tie specific acts to specific counts \u201cin the Information,\u201d noting that each of the counts alleged the same charging period were \u201cdue in large part to [C.C.\u2019s] inability to specifically say on this day and at this time\u201d each incident occurred. The trial court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection and declined to give the instruction.\n\u00b614 The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all three counts.\nIII. Appeal\n\u00b615 Carson appealed, asserting that his trial counsel\u2019s objection to the Petrich instruction constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Court of Appeals affirmed. State v. Carson, 179 Wn. App. 961, 320 P.3d 185 (2014). The court held that trial counsel\u2019s objection to the Petrich instruction was a reasonable trial tactic and thus did not constitute ineffective assistance. The court quoted extensively from the record, noting defense counsel\u2019s concerns that the Petrich instruction could confuse the jury. The Court of Appeals further noted that this objection comported with the defense\u2019s broader trial strategy, in which defense counsel \u201cavoided discussing specific incidents in his closing argument and argued instead that CC\u2019s testimony and statements were so muddled, inconsistent, and confusing that they created a reasonable doubt about whether Carson had committed any of the acts or the charged crimes . . . .\u201d Id. at 979.\n\u00b616 In dissent, Judge Worswick asserted that defense counsel\u2019s objection to the Petrich instruction was based on a belief that Petrich was inapplicable in multicount cases. Id. at 982-84. She concluded that this objection was based \u201con an erroneous view of the law\u201d and thus cannot \u201cbe characterized as a legitimate trial tactic.\u201d Id. at 984.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\u00b617 Ineffective assistance of counsel is a fact-based determination, and we review the entire record in determining whether a defendant received effective representation at trial. State v. Rhoads, 35 Wn. App. 339, 342, 666 P.2d 400 (1983); State v. Grier, 171 Wn.2d 17, 33, 246 P.3d 1260 (2011). The defendant bears the burden of establishing both \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and that \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). Reviewing courts must be highly deferential to counsel\u2019s performance and \u201cshould recognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d Id. at 690.\nANALYSIS\n\u00b618 Carson fails to establish either deficient performance or prejudice. Defense counsel did not perform defi-ciently because his objection to the State\u2019s proposed Petrich instruction was a reasonable trial tactic with the legitimate goal of avoiding jury confusion. That objection was both tactically and strategically reasonable. Carson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim also fails to satisfy the prejudice prong of the Strickland standard because the State elected the three acts on which it was relying, thus rendering a Petrich instruction unnecessary and eliminating any possible prejudice that could have resulted from defense counsel\u2019s objection to such an instruction. We therefore reject Carson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim and affirm.\nI. Background on the Petrich Instruction\n\u00b619 In the trial that gave rise to the Petrich instruction, the State presented evidence of \u201cnumerous incidents of sexual contact [that] were described in varying detail.\u201d Petrich, 101 Wn.2d at 568. Despite presenting at least four distinct incidents and evidence indicating an unknown number of additional incidents, the State charged Petrich with only one count each of indecent liberties and statutory rape. At the close of evidence, the defense moved to compel the State to elect the specific act on which it relied for conviction. The court denied the motion, and the jury convicted the defendant of both statutory rape and indecent liberties.\n\u00b620 This court held that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to compel election deprived the defendant of his right to a unanimous verdict, setting forth what became known as the Petrich rule:\nWhen the evidence indicates that several distinct criminal acts have been committed, but defendant is charged with only one count of criminal conduct, jury unanimity must be protected. . . . The State may, in its discretion, elect the act upon which it will rely for conviction. Alternatively, if the jury is instructed that all 12 jurors must agree that the same underlying criminal act has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, a unanimous verdict on one criminal act will be assured.\nId. at 572.\n\u00b621 The Petrich instruction was later incorporated into the Washington Pattern Jury Instructions. 11 Washington Practice: Washington Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal 4.25, at 110-12 (3d ed. 2008) (WPIC). The WPIC\u2019s note on use for the Petrich instruction states that the instruction should be used \u201cwhen the evidence indicates that several distinct criminal acts have been committed, but the defendant is charged with only one count of criminal conduct.\u201d See id. at 110 note on use. The WPIC instruction reflects the single-count roots of Petrich, instructing the jury that it must find that \u201cone particular act\u201d was \u201cproved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and \u201cmust unanimously agree as to which act has been proved.\u201d Id. at 110.\nII. Deficient Performance\n\u00b622 Defense counsel\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s proposed Petrich instruction did not constitute deficient performance. Our analysis begins with the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable. State v. Kyllo, 166 Wn.2d 856, 862, 215 P.3d 177 (2009). \u201cWhen counsel\u2019s conduct can be characterized as legitimate trial strategy or tactics, performance is not deficient.\u201d Id. at 863. This presumption can be overcome if the defendant can establish that \u201c \u2018there is no conceivable legitimate tactic explaining counsel\u2019s performance.\u2019 \u201d Grier, 171 Wn.2d at 33 (quoting State v. Reichenbach, 153 Wn.2d 126, 130, 101 P.3d 80 (2004)).\n\u00b623 The presumption of effective representation imposes on the defendant the burden on appeal to \u201cshow in the record the absence of legitimate strategic or tactical reasons supporting the challenged conduct by counsel.\u201d State v. McFarland, 127 Wn.2d 322, 336, 899 P.2d 1251 (1995). Carson fails to meet that burden in this case because the record demonstrates that defense counsel\u2019s decision to object to the Petrich instruction was due to concerns about the potential for jury confusion. Counsel\u2019s concerns were reasonable, and acting on them was a legitimate trial tactic. His performance, therefore, was not deficient.\nA. Counsel\u2019s objection was reasonable because the proposed instruction was confusing and potentially prejudicial\n\u00b624 The proposed instruction that the State offered was a word-for-word copy of the model Petrich instruction that appears in the Washington Pattern Jury Instructions. As defense counsel noted, that instruction\u2019s statement that \u201cone particular act... must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d made little sense in Carson\u2019s case because Carson was charged with three separate counts of child molestation. The confusion was exacerbated by the final sentence of the instruction, which would have informed the jury that it \u201cneed not unanimously agree that the defendant committed all the acts of Child Molestation in the First Degree.\u201d As defense counsel argued, \u201cIf you read that instruction, it confuses the jury into thinking, well, if you agree that one act happened, then you must agree that all of them happened.\u201d At best, then, the instruction would have been confusing and it would have failed to ensure that the jury relied on a separate act for each count. At worst, the instruction would have been highly prejudicial to Carson. The record firmly demonstrates that these concerns were the animating force behind defense counsel\u2019s objection to a Petrich instruction.\n\u00b625 It is true, as Judge Worswick noted in her Court of Appeals dissent, that the State\u2019s proposed instruction was \u201can accurate statement of applicable law.\u201d Carson, 179 Wn. App. at 984. But an accurate statement of law can be confusing when it is applied to circumstances different from those that existed when the statement of law was first made. Here, the specific language of the Petrich instruction was designed for single-count cases and is confusing when read in a multicount case. While the State\u2019s proposed instruction was an accurate statement of the law, defense counsel may reasonably have feared that reading it would confuse the jury to his client\u2019s detriment in Carson\u2019s particular case. For these reasons, the objection was a legitimate trial tactic.\n\u00b626 Defense counsel\u2019s objection also advanced the defense\u2019s broader trial strategy. On the record, defense counsel explicitly stated that his \u201ctheory of the case\u201d was that Carson \u201cleft [C.C.\u2019s parents] in a bind and they suggested\u201d the details of the sexual misconduct to C.C. As the Court of Appeals noted, defense counsel\u2019s summation \u201cavoided discussing specific incidents .. . and argued instead that CC\u2019s testimony and statements were so muddled, inconsistent, and confusing that they created a reasonable doubt about whether Carson had committed any of the acts or the charged crimes.\u201d Id. at 979.\n\u00b627 Because the defense\u2019s theory focused on the credibility of C.C. and his testimony, defense counsel may have concluded any parsing out of the individual acts would have undercut his strategy by planting the idea in the jury\u2019s mind that C.C. might have told the truth about at least some of what happened. At best, then, the Petrich instruction was irrelevant to the defense\u2019s broader trial strategy; at worst, it could have actively undercut that strategy. This further underscores the reasonableness of defense counsel\u2019s decision to object to the reading of the State\u2019s proposed instruction.\n\u00b628 The concurrence asserts that Carson\u2019s attorney should not have objected to the modified Petrich instruction because such an instruction would not have been inconsistent with his primary strategy of painting the charges as wholly false. We must resist the temptation to substitute our own personal judgment for that of Carson\u2019s attorney because \u201cit is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. Thus, the deficient performance inquiry does not permit us to decide what we believe would have been the ideal strategy and then declare an attorney\u2019s performance deficient for failing to follow that strategy. On the contrary, counsel\u2019s performance is adequate as long as his challenged decisions \u201ccan be characterized as legitimate trial strategy or tactics.\u201d Kyllo, 166 Wn.2d at 863 (emphasis added). The decision to object to the State\u2019s proposed Petrich instruction plainly can be so characterized. Even assuming the objection would have been, as the concurrence suggests, \u201cnot inconsistent with\u201d trial counsel\u2019s primary strategy (concurrence (Gordon McCloud, J.) at 235), many trial advocacy experts recommend that attorneys eschew alternative arguments before a jury, which may view the presentation of an alternative argument as a sign that the attorney believes his first argument is weak:\n[A] difficult issue is whether an advocate should advance alternative theories that are not inconsistent\u2014for example, defending a contract suit by claiming duress and also arguing that the defendant\u2019s performance did not constitute a breach of the contract. Because of the cost of overtrying, advancing the second defense may be viewed by the jury as revealing the attorney\u2019s lack of confidence in his first defense. Here again, most experienced attorneys advise, as a general rule, against advancing multiple theories to the jury, even if such theories are not inconsistent.\nRobert H. Klonoff & Paul L. Colby, Winning Jury Trials: Trial Tactics and Sponsorship Strategies 39-40 (3d ed. 2007). Indeed, we have previously held that an all-or-nothing approach, though risky, is a reasonable trial strategy. Grier, 171 Wn.2d at 42. Here, defense counsel may reasonably have wished to avoid an argument that could be summarized as \u201c[a] 11 the allegations are false\u2014and even if they are not all false, you have to agree on which allegations are true\u201d or \u201cCarson did not abuse C.C.\u2014and even if he did, he did not do it three separate times.\u201d\n\u00b629 Because objecting to the proposed Petrich instruction in Carson\u2019s case can be characterized as part of a legitimate trial strategy, defense counsel did not perform deficiently when he objected to the instruction and instead focused on portraying the allegations against his client as wholly false.\nB. Counsel\u2019s objection was not based on a misunderstanding of law\n\u00b630 We reject Carson\u2019s argument, echoing the Court of Appeals dissent, that defense counsel\u2019s objection to the Petrich instruction was per se unreasonable because it was \u201cbased on misunderstandings of the law.\u201d Carson, 179 Wn. App. at 984-85 (Worswick, C.J., dissenting). The day before he objected, defense counsel stated that he did not think that a Petrich instruction was necessary in Carson\u2019s specific case because the evidence revealed \u201cthree separate and distinct incidents, one in [C.C.\u2019s] room, one in his mother\u2019s room, and one in the bathroom.\u201d Defense counsel appears to be correct in this regard\u2014we have never specifically held that Petrich must be read in cases where there is exact congruence between the number of incidents described in the evidence and the number of criminal counts charged.\n\u00b631 But more importantly, this was not the reason that defense counsel cited when he objected the following day. As discussed above, the record demonstrates that the potential for jury confusion was the driving force behind defense counsel\u2019s objection to the proposed Petrich instruction. When asked if he was objecting to the proposed Petrich instruction, defense counsel\u2019s response was \u201cI think it is confusing, yes.\u201d Concerns that the jury could be \u201cconfused\u201d or \u201cmisled\u201d dominated defense counsel\u2019s explanations of why he did not want a Petrich instruction read to the jury. Thus, defense counsel\u2019s objection was not \u201cbased on\u201d his understanding (or misunderstanding) of applicable law and his performance could not have been rendered deficient by any misconceptions he may have harbored regarding that law. For these reasons, even if we were to adopt a per se rule that misunderstandings of law automatically render an attorney\u2019s performance deficient, it would not rescue Carson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim.\n\u00b632 Moreover, no decision of this court has addressed the circumstances of Carson\u2019s trial: a defendant charged with n (which, in Carson\u2019s case, is equal to three) counts, evidence tending to show only n incidents that meet the elements of the crime, and the prosecution identifies the acts on which the charges are based. Certainly, defense counsel believed that the evidence showed only three distinct incidents\u2014a point that he made each time he discussed the possibility of a Petrich instruction, including the discussion that occurred after the State completed its case in chief. See 1 Report of Proceedings (RP) at 6; 3 RP at 335; 4 RP at 408. Reading the Petrich instruction in such a multicount case could be prejudicial to the defendant, as defense counsel noted: the instruction\u2019s reference to \u201cone particular act\u201d combined with the disclaimer that the jury \u201cneed not unanimously agree that the defendant committed all the acts\u201d might confuse a jury into thinking that they may convict the defendant on all counts as long as they unanimously agree on at least one criminal act.\n\u00b633 The WPICs do not provide an example of a multicount variation on the Petrich instruction. As previously noted, the WPIC note on use for the Petrich instruction advises courts to \u201c[u]se this instruction . . . when the evidence indicates that several distinct criminal acts have been committed, but the defendant is charged with only one count of criminal conduct.\u201d WPIC 4.25 at 110 note on use (emphasis added). A sentence in the comment on the pattern instruction states that \u201c[i]f the instruction is being modified for multiple counts, then the instruction needs to clearly require unanimity for one particular act for each count charged.\u201d Id. at 113 cmt. (citing State v. Watkins, 136 Wn. App. 240, 148 P.3d 1112 (2006)). The comment does not, however, provide an example of a suitable instruction.\n\u00b634 Against that background, one can hardly blame defense counsel for choosing to avoid the Petrich instruction rather than attempting an ad hoc rewrite of the instruction, particularly given that the distinctions between the various incidents were irrelevant to the defense\u2019s theory of the case. Accordingly, it was reasonable for defense counsel to object to the Petrich instruction. For these reasons, Carson\u2019s trial counsel did not perform deficiently. We reject his ineffective assistance claim on that basis.\nIII. Prejudice\n\u00b635 Given the State\u2019s clear election of three acts in its closing argument, Carson was not prejudiced by the absence of a Petrich instruction. Because we are reviewing only defense counsel\u2019s performance rather than the trial court\u2019s failure to give a Petrich instruction, we use the Strickland standard for ineffective assistance claims and require the defendant to demonstrate that his attorney\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced him. State v. Robinson, 138 Wn.2d 753, 765-69, 982 P.2d 590 (1999). We use the Strickland standard even where the defendant claims that his attorney\u2019s deficient performance affected his constitutional rights. Id. at 765-66; State v. West, 139 Wn.2d 37, 42, 983 P.2d 617 (1999).\n\u00b636 Under Strickland, we do not presume prejudice unless the trial \u201closes its character as a confrontation between adversaries,\u201d State v. Webbe, 122 Wn. App. 683, 694-95, 94 P.3d 994 (2004), as when there is (1) a complete denial of the assistance of counsel, (2) the State\u2019s interference with counsel\u2019s assistance, or (3) an actual conflict of interest. See id.; Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692; In re Pers. Restraint of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 647, 674, 101 P.3d 1 (2004). Strickland explained that a presumption of prejudice makes sense in these narrow circumstances because \u201c[prejudice ... is so likely that case-by-case inquiry into prejudice is not worth the cost\u201d and that with respect to conflicts of interest, \u201ccounsel breaches the duty of loyalty, perhaps the most basic of counsel\u2019s duties.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692.\n\u00b637 None of Strickland\u2019s presumptively prejudicial circumstances exist here. Consequently, under Strickland\u2019s standard of review, Carson bears the burden of establishing that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different Kyllo, 166 Wn.2d at 862. Here, far from demonstrating prejudice, the circumstances of Carson\u2019s trial strongly suggest that the absence of a Petrich instruction was harmless because the State, in its closing argument, elected the acts on which it was relying.\n\u00b638 Petrich\u2019s multiple acts instruction applies only when the State fails to \u201celect the act upon which it will rely for conviction.\u201d Petrich, 101 Wn.2d at 572; see also WPIC 4.25 at 110 note on use (\u201cIf there is evidence of multiple distinct occurrences of the crime, but the prosecution elects to rely upon a specific occurrence to support a conviction, then this Petrich instruction should not be used.\u201d). For an election to be effective, \u201ceither the State must tell the jury which act to rely on in its deliberations or the court must instruct the jury to agree on a specific criminal act.\u201d State v. Kitchen, 110 Wn.2d 403, 409, 756 P.2d 105 (1988).\n\u00b639 We have never held that the State\u2019s election of an act must be ratified by the court or incorporated into the charging document or jury instructions in order to be effective. On the contrary, and as our use of the phrase \u201ctell the jury\u201d in Kitchen suggests, id. (emphasis added), an election can be made by the prosecuting attorney in a verbal statement to the jury as long as the prosecution \u201cclearly identifie [s] the act upon which\u201d the charge in question is based. State v. Thompson, 169 Wn. App. 436, 474-75, 290 P.3d 996 (2012) (\u201c[b]ecause the State clearly identified the act upon which the sexual motivation allegation was based\u201d in its closing argument, \u201cno unanimity instruction was necessary\u201d); compare, e.g., id., and In re Pers. Restraint of Delgado, 160 Wn. App. 898, 902, 251 P.3d 899 (2011) (prosecutor \u201c \u2018clearly elected ... the criminal acts associated with the two counts during its closing arguments\u2019 \u201d (quoting State v. Delgado, noted at 139 Wn. App. 1068, 2007 WL 2085344, at *4, 2007 Wash. App. LEXIS 2098, at *10)), with State v. Williams, 136 Wn. App. 486, 497, 150 P.3d 111 (2007) (no clear election in closing argument where prosecutor \u201cemphasized\u201d one act over others but did not \u201cexpressly elect to rely only on\u201d one act \u201cin seeking the conviction\u201d).\n\u00b640 Here, the evidence tended to show only three separate acts and an election arguably was not even necessary. But even if we were to assume arguendo that the evidence could be construed as pointing to additional acts, the State, in its closing argument, clearly and explicitly elected the three acts on which it was relying for conviction: the incident where C.C.\u2019s \u201cbusiness was twisted ... in the bathroom\u201d and the incidents where Carson \u201ctried to put his penis in [C.C.\u2019s] bottom\u201d in C.C.\u2019s room and in his parents\u2019 room. The State specifically disclaimed its intention to rely on any other instances where Carson may have attempted to put his penis in C.C.\u2019s bottom, stating that it was only \u201cfocusing on\u201d the incidents in C.C.\u2019s room and Hagen\u2019s room and telling the jury that those were the only incidents that the State \u201cwould like you to focus on for the purposes of your deliberations.\u201d\n\u00b641 This suffices to constitute an election. The prosecutor, unlike the court, cannot actually instruct the jury to ignore particular testimony or evidence. By specifying exactly three instances of sexual misconduct and disclaiming the State\u2019s intention to rely on other acts, the State effectively elected the acts on which the State sought a conviction. Because Petrich instructions need not be read in cases where the State makes an election, no Petrich instruction was necessary in Carson\u2019s trial and the absence of such an instruction did not prejudice Carson. Thus, even if the defense attorney\u2019s objection constituted deficient performance, Carson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim would fail.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b642 Carson has established neither deficient performance nor prejudice. We therefore reject his ineffective assistance claim and affirm.\nJohnson, Owens, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nState v. Petrich, 101 Wn.2d 566, 572, 683 P.2d 173 (1984), abrogated in part on other grounds by State v. Kitchen, 110 Wn.2d 403, 405-06, 756 P.2d 105 (1988).\nCarson argues that C.C. and Hagen testified at trial regarding incidents other than the ones described in the videotaped interview, citing brief references to an \u201coffice\u201d and a \u201ccloset\u201d in C.C.\u2019s and Hagen\u2019s testimony, respectively. It is not clear that the mention of \u201ca closet\u201d referred to a separate incident from the zip-ties- and-tape incident because Hagen testified that she was not sure whether C.C. was referring to \u201cone incident or more\u201d when he first disclosed Carson\u2019s abuse. Moreover, C.C.\u2019s testimony during trial showed that he had great difficulty remembering any specifics regarding the instances of sexual abuse. Because the record contains minimal detail regarding the references to an \u201coffice\u201d and a \u201ccloset,\u201d it is difficult to determine whether these constituted separate incidents from the three that C.C. described in his videotaped interview rather than simply a sign that C.C. had trouble remembering where and how each incident occurred. Considering C.C.\u2019s very young age and the two-year gap between the alleged incidents and the trial, his difficulties with remembering, describing, and distinguishing between each incident are hardly surprising. In any case, for the reasons set forth below in our analysis, the prosecution\u2019s closing argument elected the acts on which the State was relying for conviction, thus eliminating the risk that the jury might convict Carson based on any supposed other acts.\nNotably, defense counsel made this statement after C.C. and Hagen had completed their trial testimony and, thus, after the statements discussed supra note 2.\nCarson also argued before the Court of Appeals that the trial court itself erred by failing to give a Petrich instruction. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument under the invited error doctrine. State v. Carson, 179 Wn. App. 961, 973-75, 320 P.3d 185 (2014). Carson also raised a public trial claim based on the sealing of juror questionnaires, but the Court of Appeals held that our decision in State v. Beskurt, 176 Wn.2d 441, 447, 293 P.3d 1159 (2013) (plurality opinion), defeated this claim. Carson, 179 Wn. App. at 971-72. Carson did not include either of these issues in his petition for review, and we do not address them further.\nWPIC 4.25 reads:\nThe [State] [County] [City] alleges that the defendant committed acts of (identify crime) on multiple occasions. To convict the defendant [on any count] of (identify crime), one particular act of (identify crime) must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and you must unanimously agree as to which act has been proved. You need not unanimously agree that the defendant committed all the acts of (identify crime).\n(Alterations in original.)\nIn his petition for review, Carson asserts for the first time that \u201csince defense counsel believed the instruction was confusing, he could have proposed a modified unanimity instruction.\u2019\u2019 Pet. for Review at 15. But Carson has neither cited to a suitable instruction nor set forth a proposed instruction that he believes should have been read at trial. Defense counsel could have reasonably concluded that the risks of crafting an untested variation on the Petrich instruction outweighed the slight risk that the jury would convict his client based on acts other than the three that were described in the video.\nIn so doing, the concurrence sets up a straw man by asserting that the court\u2019s opinion \u201cassert[s] that a unanimity instruction would have been inconsistent with the general defense strategy of attacking the accuser\u2019s credibility.\u201d Concurrence (Gordon McCloud, J.) at 235. We say no such thing. Rather, we simply have noted that defense counsel\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s proposed instruction can reasonably be seen as advancing his trial strategy.\nThe concurrence grossly mischaracterizes our reasoning on these points, accusing us of concluding \u201cThat a Unanimity Instruction Is Unnecessary in a Multicount Case\u2019\u2019 and of holding that \u201ca Petrich instruction is always unnecessary when the number of acts alleged is equal to the number of counts charged.\u2019\u2019 Concurrence (Gordon McCloud, J.) at 231. The concurrence would be considerably more helpful to the reader if it did not ignore what we have actually said in this opinion. First, the concurrence\u2019s mischaracterizations ignore a point that we emphasize throughout this opinion: the defense counsel\u2019s stated reason for objecting to the proposed instruction was his reasonable fear of jury confusion, not his understanding (or misunderstanding) of the applicable law. Moreover, we do not conclude that a unanimity instruction is never necessary in a multicount case (a question that is not presented in this ineffective assistance case); rather, we hold that it was not deficient performance for defense counsel to object to a Petrich instruction \u201cin Carson\u2019s specific case\u2019\u2019 in part because the evidence showed \u201cthree separate and distinct incidents.\u2019\u2019 And we do not hold that a Petrich instruction is \u201calways unnecessary\u2019\u2019 when there is exact congruence between the acts alleged and the counts charged; rather, we simply note that we have never \u201cspecifically held\u2019\u2019 that a Petrich instruction must be read in such cases, thus adding credence to defense counsel\u2019s conclusion that it would be better to avoid such an instruction in Carson\u2019s specific case.\nEven when defense counsel did discuss the underlying law, he did not claim that Petrich could be applied only in single-count cases. Instead, he argued that the instruction normally is read in single-count cases and was not designed for multicount cases and that its language can be confusing if read in multicount cases.\nThe concurrence opines that we \u201cspecifically held that a Petrich instruction is constitutionally required in a case where there is exact congruence between the acts alleged and the counts charged,\u2019\u2019 citing State v. Vander Houwen, 163 Wn.2d 25, 38-39, 177 P.3d 93 (2008). Concurrence (Gordon McCloud, J.) at 234. The concurrence overlooks the important qualification in Vander Houwen that the Petrich instruction is unnecessary if the prosecution specifies the incidents supporting the charges: \u201cThe absence of a unanimity instruction, along with the State\u2019s failure to identify specific acts on which to charge, is fatal.\u2019\u2019 163 Wn.2d at 38 (emphasis added). It is this factor that distinguishes this case from Vander Houwen. As discussed supra note 2, the evidence in this case points to only three separate and distinct incidents. The concurrence claims that our opinion makes a \u201csweeping general assertion that where the number of counts charged is the same as the number of acts alleged, that congruence makes Petrich inapplicable.\u2019\u2019 Concurrence (Gordon McCloud, J.) at 233. Once again, this misstates our actual holding and ignores the posture of this case. The Court of Appeals correctly rejected Carson\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in failing to provide a Petrich instruction claim under the doctrine of invited error, see Carson, 179 Wn. App. at 973-75, and Carson did not challenge that ruling in his petition for review. Consequently, the sole issue now before us is Carson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. Given the limited scope of our review, we make no ruling on whether some variation of the Petrich instruction would have been necessary in this case had defense counsel requested one; rather, we simply hold that defense counsel\u2019s decision to object to the State\u2019s proposed Petrich instruction was reasonable under the circumstances of this case.\nThe concurrence asserts that two Court of Appeals cases cited in the comment include suitable instructions, specifically State v. Hayes, 81 Wn. App. 425, 914 P.2d 788 (1996), and State v. Borsheim, 140 Wn. App. 357, 165 P.3d 417 (2007). Concurrence (Gordon McCloud, J.) at 232-33. But we have never required attorneys to have an encyclopedic knowledge of every case cited in every comment in every pattern jury instruction relevant to their case, particularly since neither the pattern instructions nor their comments have any binding effect. We decline to impose such a requirement in this case. In any event, the issue in Hayes was not the legal adequacy of the jury instructions but rather the sufficiency of the evidence. And Hayes does not include a specific model instruction. Rather, one note in Hayes quotes bits and pieces from three separate instructions, which the court never analyzes other than to observe that \u201c[t]he trial court... complied with the requirement to properly instruct the jury.\u201d 81 Wn. App. at 431. In short, Hayes includes neither a model instruction nor any meaningful analysis of the instructions given. Furthermore, the Borsheim instruction\u2019s admonition that the jury must \u201c \u201cunanimously agree as to which act or acts have been proved\u2019 \u201d does not actually require the jury to use a separate act for each count. Borsheim, 140 Wn. App. at 364 (emphasis omitted). A similar flaw afflicts one of the other cases cited in the comment\u2014State v. Noltie, which included an instruction that required the jury to unanimously agree on \u201c \u2018at least one separate act\u2019 \u201d for each count. 116 Wn.2d 831, 843, 809 P.2d 190 (1991). As the Court of Appeals has noted, the Noltie instruction fails to make it clear that \u201cthe jury must agree on the same act for each count.\u201d Watkins, 136 Wn. App. at 246. These cases highlight the difficulties courts have faced in adapting Petrich for use in multicount cases and further suggest the reasonableness of trial counsel\u2019s decision to object to the State\u2019s proposed instruction in Carson\u2019s case, particularly given counsel\u2019s belief that the evidence pointed to only three criminal acts.\nSee also In re Pers. Restraint of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 647, 674, 101 P.3d 1 (2004) (limiting presumption of prejudice to three circumstances outlined in Strickland plus other circumstances where \u201c \u2018the likelihood that any lawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into actual conduct of the trial\u2019 \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Visciotti v. Woodford, 288 P.3d 1097, 1106 (9th Cir.), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 537 U.S. 19, 123 S. Ct. 357, 154 L. Ed. 2d 279 (2002))); State v. Cienfuegos, 144 Wn.2d 222, 228-29, 25 P.3d 1011 (2001) (declining to hold that trial counsel\u2019s failure to request a diminished capacity instruction was ineffective per se because \u201c[t]he question of whether counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective is generally not amenable to per se rules, but requires a case by case basis analysis\u201d).\nThe Strickland Court elaborated:\n[Where a defendant is completely denied counsel or the State interferes with counsel\u2019s assistance, prejudice] is so likely that case-by-case inquiry into prejudice is not worth the cost. Moreover, such circumstances involve impairments of the Sixth Amendment right that are easy to identify and, for that reason and because the prosecution is directly responsible, easy for the government to prevent.\n[When there is an actual conflict of interest],... it is difficult to measure the precise effect on the defense of representation corrupted by conflicting interests. Given the obligation of counsel to avoid conflicts of interest and the ability of trial courts to make early inquiry in certain situations likely to give rise to conflicts, it is reasonable for the criminal justice system to maintain a fairly rigid rule of presumed prejudice for conflicts of interest.\n466 U.S. at 692 (citations omitted) (citing U.S. Const. amend. VI).\nIn its Court of Appeals brief, the State argued that no Petrich instruction had been necessary because the State had made an election. The Court of Appeals acknowledged this argument in its discussion of Carson\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in failing to give a Petrich instruction, Carson, 179 Wn. App. at 972-73, but it neither acknowledged nor discussed it in the context of Carson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim.\nSimilar to the Court of Appeals holding in Williams, we held in State v. Kier, 164 Wn.2d 798, 811-13, 194 P.3d 212 (2008), that the prosecution\u2019s closing-argument election was ineffective because it was not sufficiently clear. In Kier, like the prosecutor in Williams and in contrast to the closing argument in this case, the prosecutor merely named the acts on which he was relying; he did not, as the prosecutor at Carson\u2019s trial did, tell the jury that they were the only acts on which the State was relying. This latter element is essential to a clear election: the State must not only discuss the acts on which it is relying, it must in some way disclaim its intention to rely on other acts.\nSee supra note 2.\nIn a note to her dissent, Judge Worswick asserts that the State \u201cclearly chose not to elect,\u2019\u2019 citing two statements that the prosecutor made outside the presence of the jury. Carson, 179 Wn. App. at 985 n.27. But these statements came before the prosecutor made his election. Asserting that the State had not elected three specific acts in the information did not foreclose the possibility that the State would make such an election in its closing argument\u2014as it ultimately did. Cf. State v. King, 75 Wn. App. 899, 903, 878 P.2d 466 (1994) (court declined to give unanimity instruction \u201cin light of the State\u2019s avowed intention to make an election in argument\u2019\u2019; because State ultimately failed to make such a closing-argument election, absence of Petrich instruction was error).\nThis conclusion might be different had the jury returned guilty verdicts on only one or two of the three counts. Such verdicts would indicate prejudice by raising the possibility that some jurors had convicted Carson based on one of the acts highlighted by the prosecution, while others had relied on a separate act. But because the jury returned guilty verdicts on all three counts, it is apparent that the jury believed that the defendant had committed all three incidents of molestation. Likewise, there may be circumstances where a late election by the prosecution would be prejudicial to the defendant. But no such prejudice could have occurred here because defense counsel expressed his opinion even before the prosecution\u2019s election that the evidence tended to show only three separate acts of misconduct. The prosecutor\u2019s election thus did nothing more than make explicit what the evidence already showed.",

I am also concerned that the concurrence erroneously characterizes the majority as announcing a broader holding than it does. But to me, the path to greater clarity is to state the relevant holding in its simplest terms: Carson\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails because the State made a clear election before the case went to the jury, specifying exactly three separate acts for the three separate counts of first degree child molestation.

        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b644 (concurring) \u2014 Defense counsel objected to a Petrich instruction in this case for two reasons. First, he voiced a legitimate concern that the instruction\u2014as proposed by the State\u2014could confuse the jury into thinking that if the evidence supported a conviction on one count, it necessarily supported convictions on all three counts. 3 Report of Proceedings (RP) at 336. Second, he asserted\u2014incorrectly\u2014that no unanimity instruction is necessary in a multicount case. He explained that \u201c[generally, when you read the comments to the Petrich instruction, it doesn\u2019t apply ... to multi[ ] count cases:... it\u2019s when you have one count but you have like six possible acts that could have accounted for [it].\u201d 4 RP at 405 (emphasis added). He supported this argument by stating that he had \u201clooked at the comments [to the pattern jury Petrich instruction] that indicate, as I read it, that [the instruction] should only be used where you\u2019re alleging one count but multiple acts rid. at 408 (citing 11 Washington Practice: Washington Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal 4.25, at 110-12 (3d ed. 2008) (WPIC)).\n\u00b645 The majority holds that these were good reasons showing legitimate defense strategy because a Petrich instruction is always unnecessary when the number of acts alleged is equal to the number of counts charged. See, e.g., majority at 222 (\u201cDefense counsel appears to be correct [that a Petrich instruction was not necessary]\u2014we have never specifically held that Petrich must be read in cases where there is exact congruence between the number of incidents described in the evidence and the number of criminal counts charged.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\u00b646 I respectfully disagree. If defense counsel had done his background research, he would have discovered that our court has held\u2014and the WPICs confirm\u2014that a Petrich-type unanimity instruction should be given in multicount cases and that it should be given in tried-and-true language that our court has quoted and the WPIC committee has endorsed. I therefore agree with the dissent in the Court of Appeals that trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\n\u00b647 However, I also agree with the majority that the deficient performance did not cause prejudice. I therefore concur.\nI. The Majority Incorrectly Concludes That a Unanimity Instruction Is Unnecessary in a Multicount Case\n\u00b648 As the majority notes, the Petrich instruction originated in a case in which the State charged only one count each of two crimes and supported each count with multiple alleged acts. Majority at 216-17 (quoting Petrich, 101 Wn.2d at 572). But Petrich has outgrown its single-count roots. Now, it also applies where multiple acts provide the bases for multiple counts of the same crime. 11 WPIC 4.25, at 113 cmt. (\u201cIf the instruction is being modified for multiple counts, then the instruction needs to clearly require unanimity for one particular act for each count charged.\u201d (citing State v. Watkins, 136 Wn. App. 240, 148 P.3d 1112 (2006))); State v. Vander Houwen, 163 Wn.2d 25, 37-39, 177 P.3d 93 (2008) (defendant entitled to unanimity instruction where he was charged with 10 counts of waste of wildlife and 10 counts of killing game out of season based on evidence that defendant shot 10 different elk).\n\u00b649 This extension of Petrich is unsurprising: a Petrich instruction serves just as compelling a purpose in a multicount case as it does in a single-count case. Vander Houwen, 163 Wn.2d at 38 (\u201cBecause the State did not articulate which cause number went with each elk, it is impossible to ensure that all of the jurors voted to convict based on the same two dead elk.\u201d); State v. Kitchen, 110 Wn.2d 403, 411, 756 P.2d 105 (1988) (Petrich ensures jury unanimity \u201cas to which act or incident constitutes the crime\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\u00b650 Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the WPIC does \u201cprovide an example of a multicount variation on the Petrich instruction.\u201d Majority at 224. The WPIC comment cites to State v. Hayes, in which Division One held the following to be a proper multicount Petrich instruction:\n\u201cA separate crime is charged in each count. You must decide each count separately. Your verdict on one count should not control your verdict on any other count.\n\u201cTo convict [for each count, you must find as an element]:\n\u201c. . . That on or about the 1st day of July, 1990 through the 31st day of May, 1992, but an occasion separate and distinct from that charged in [the remaining counts], the defendant had sexual intercourse with [the victim];\n\u201c. . . For you to return a verdict of guilty all twelve jurors must agree that the same incident of sexual intercourse has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n81 Wn. App. 425, 431 n.9, 914 P.2d 788 (1996) (emphasis added) (second and fourth alterations in original) (citations omitted) (quoting jury instructions).\n\u00b651 The WPIC comments also cite State v. Borsheim, 140 Wn. App. 357,165 P.3d 417 (2007), another multicount case. WPIC 4.25, at 113 cmt. Borsheim held that the following instruction satisfies the jury unanimity requirement in a multicount case:\n\u201cThere are allegations that the Defendant committed acts of rape of [a] child on multiple occasions. To convict the Defendant, one or more particular acts must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and you must unanimously agree as to which act or acts have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. You need not unanimously agree that all the acts have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\nBorsheim, 140 Wn. App. at 364 (quoting jury instructions).\n\u00b652 In light of these two examples, defense counsel did not have to choose between \u201cavoid[ing] the Petrich instruction\u201d and \u201cattempting an ad hoc rewrite of the instruction.\u201d Majority at 225. Instead, he could have read the authority cited in the WPIC comment and requested an instruction based on the examples it provided. I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that trial counsel\u2019s performance reflected a legitimate tactical decision. Instead, trial counsel\u2019s failure to conduct this background research constituted deficient performance. See State v. Kyllo, 166 Wn.2d 856, 865-69, 215 P.3d 177 (2009) (defense counsel\u2019s request for a particular WPIC constituted deficient performance where research would have shown at least three decisions and a statute revealing that the instruction misstated the law).\n\u00b653 The majority also makes the sweeping general assertion that where the number of counts charged is the same as the number of acts alleged, that congruence makes Petrich inapplicable:\n[N]o decision of this court has addressed the circumstances of Carson\u2019s trial: a defendant charged with n (which, in Carson\u2019s case, is equal to three) counts [and] evidence tending to show only n incidents that meet the elements of the crime .... Reading the Petrich instruction in such a multicount case could be prejudicial to the defendant ....\nMajority at 223-24 (emphasis added).\n\u00b654 Again, I respectfully disagree. Congruence between the number of acts alleged and the number of guilty verdicts returned is certainly relevant to the prejudice inquiry in this case. But congruence between acts alleged and counts charged makes no difference to the initial question presented here: whether counsel reasonably refused a unanimity instruction in the first place. Without a unanimity instruction, the defendant has no assurance that individual jurors will convict based on the same single act for each count. This is equally true whether the number of acts alleged does or does not equal the number of counts charged.\n\u00b655 The majority is incorrect when it asserts that \u201cwe have never \u2018specifically held\u2019 that a Petrich instruction must be read\u201d in cases where \u201cthere is exact congruence between the acts alleged and the counts charged.\u201d Majority at 222 n.8. In Vander Houwen, the state found 10 slain elk in the defendant\u2019s apple orchard and charged him with 10 counts each of waste of wildlife and unlawful big game hunting\u201410 counts of each charge for 10 alleged acts of shooting an elk. 163 Wn.2d at 31, 38. Because there was neither a unanimity instruction nor an election, and because the jury returned guilty verdicts on only two counts of unlawful killing, we reversed those two convictions. Id. at 38-39. We explained that because the State failed to specify which elk were the bases for which counts, it was \u201cimpossible to ensure that all of the jurors voted to convict based on the same two dead elk.\u201d Id. at 38. We thus specifically held that a Petrich instruction is constitutionally required in a case where there is exact congruence between the acts alleged and the counts charged.\nII. The Majority Incorrectly Holds That Defense Counsel\u2019s Objection to the Unanimity Instruction Was a Legitimate Trial Strategy\n\u00b656 The majority also concludes that defense counsel objected to the jury unanimity instruction because this \u201cadvanced the defense\u2019s broader trial strategy.\u201d According to the majority, this strategy was to \u201c \u2018avoid[ ] discussing specific incidents ... and argue [ ] instead that [all of] CC\u2019s testimony [lacked credibility].\u2019 \u201d Majority at 219-20 (second alteration in original) (quoting State v. Carson, 179 Wn. App. 961, 979, 320 P.3d 185 (2014)).\n\u00b657 This seems like an overly formalistic assessment of how a criminal defense lawyer\u2019s theory of the case works.\n\u00b658 First, the majority\u2019s theory ignores the presence of instruction 3, which advised the jurors that they \u201cmust decide each count separately\u201d and that their \u201cverdict on one count should not control [their] verdict on any other count.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 63. It is unclear why defense counsel would have objected to a unanimity instruction on the basis that it distinguished between the charges while ignoring an instruction that explicitly required the jury to make just such a distinction.\n\u00b659 Second, the majority is incorrect in asserting that a unanimity instruction would have been inconsistent with the general defense strategy of attacking the accuser\u2019s credibility. Carson argued that the jury should not convict on any count at all; the unanimity instruction would have told the jury that it also could not convict on any single count unless every juror unanimously agreed on the incident forming the basis for that count. Success on the first theory depends on discrediting the victim\u2019s testimony as to all three alleged incidents; success on the second theory depends on discrediting the victim\u2019s testimony as to any one, two, or three of those same incidents. The second argument is not inconsistent with the first. In fact, they are completely consistent: they both depend on discrediting the victim. Far from contradicting the general defense, the unanimity instruction would have added an extra layer of protection for the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\u00b660 As noted above, defense counsel did express a legitimate concern about confusing the jury\u2014he feared that in a multicount case, the standard Petrich instruction might confuse the jury into thinking that if it convicted on one count, it must convict on all counts. See majority at 219-20. But defense counsel could have addressed this confusion without also jeopardizing his client\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict. He could have requested an instruction like the one in Hayes, which tells the jurors that they can convict on any one count only if they unanimously agree that the defendant committed the act supporting that count on \u201c \u2018an occasion separate and distinct from that charged in [the remaining counts]! \u201d 81 Wn. App. at 431 n.9 (emphasis added) (alteration in original). Our cases clearly support the giving of such an instruction in cases involving not just single counts but also multiple counts. See State v. Noltie, 116 Wn.2d 831, 846, 809 P.2d 190 (1991); Vander Houwen, 163 Wn.2d at 37-38.\n\u00b661 For these reasons, I would hold that defense counsel\u2019s objection to a jury unanimity instruction constituted deficient performance. I agree with the dissent in the Court of Appeals that \u201cbasing a decision on an erroneous view of the law can [not] be characterized as a legitimate trial tactic.\u201d Carson, 179 Wn. App. at 984.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b662 I agree with the majority\u2019s holding on prejudice, and I would affirm solely on that basis. But I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that a Petrich instruction is unnecessary in a multicount case, I disagree with the majority\u2019s implication that a unanimity instruction is unnecessary where the number of acts alleged equals the number of counts charged, and I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that a unanimity instruction is inconsistent with the defense of general denial. For these reasons, I respectfully concur.\nMadsen, C.J., concurs with Gordon McCloud, J.\nState v. Petrich, 101 Wn.2d 566, 683 P.2d 173 (1984).",

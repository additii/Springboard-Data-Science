By this act a commission was created for the purpose of constructing and equipping a State Hospital for Nervous Diseases and a Tuberculosis Sanitarium.\nThe case of Bull v. Ziegler, 186 Ark. 477, 54 S. W. (2d) 283, is decisive of the question that such agencies of the State are not subject to garnishment. See also Watson v. Dodge, 187 Ark. 1055, 63 S. W. (2d) 993.\nThe writ will be awarded as prayed prohibiting further proceedings in that suit.",

        "text": "Fairhurst, J.\n\u00b61 Washington\u2019s Public Records Act (PRA), chapter 42.56 RCW, allows citizens broad access to public records and provides a cause of action to challenge inadequate responses to records requests. When Mike Belenski requested certain records from Jefferson County (County), the County responded that it had \u201cno responsive records.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 214. Over two years later, Belenski sued the County, asserting that this response violated the PRA because the County did in fact have such records and failed to make the proper disclosures. The Court of Appeals dismissed this claim as time barred under the two year statute of limitations in RCW 4.16.130.\n\u00b62 At issue is which statute of limitations applies to Belenski\u2019s PRA claim and whether the applicable statute renders his claim time barred. We hold that the one year statute of limitations in the PRA applies to Belenski\u2019s claim and that this limitations period usually begins to run on an agency\u2019s final, definitive response to a records request. However, we remand this case for the trial court to determine whether equitable tolling should toll the statute of limitations.\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\u00b63 Belenski has requested and received many public records from the County over time. Since at least the year 2000, Belenski has sought Internet access logs (IALs) to monitor county employee Internet usage. This case involves four of Belenski\u2019s PRA requests, only one of which is now before us. On September 27, 2010, Belenski sent the County a PRA request asking to inspect \u201cthe Internet Access Logs from February 1, 2010 to September 27, 2010.\u201d CP at 211. One week later, the County mailed a response to Belenski\u2019s \u201cPublic Records Request Dated September 27, 2010 - Internet access logs from February 1, 2010 to September 27, 2010,\u201d stating that \u201cthe County has no responsive records.\u201d CP at 214. Belenski received this response via e-mail on October 5, 2010. CP at 213.\n\u00b64 Belenski explained that he was \u201cconfused\u201d by the county\u2019s response because he had requested and received IAL data from the County in the past. CP at 120. This led him to follow up through conversations with county employees and file other PRA requests (that are not before us). Eventually, Belenski discovered (through a separate public records response) e-mails between county employees sent shortly after his request admitting that the IALs existed during the relevant time period of Belenski\u2019s PRA request, but suggesting the County need not provide them because they are not \u201cnatively viewable\u201d and would need to be \u201cpulled out of a database and generated in a human readable format.\u201d CP at 138.\n\u00b65 On November 19, 2012, Belenski sued the County, alleging violations of the PRA for his September 27, 2010 request for IALs, along with other PRA requests that are not before us.\n\u00b66 The trial court held that IALs are not public records and, therefore, dismissed the claim at issue because the PRA applies only to public records. The Court of Appeals reversed in part, determining that IALs are public records. Belenski v. Jefferson County, 187 Wn. App. 724, 732-33, 350 P.3d 689 (2015), review granted, 184 Wn.2d 1032, 364 P.3d 120 (2016). However, the Court of Appeals ultimately dismissed Belenski\u2019s claim as time barred by the statute of limitations. The court noted that two possible statutes of limitations may apply\u2014the one year statute of limitations under the PRA, RCW 42.56.550(6), or the two year catchall statute of limitations, RCW 4.16.130. Belenski, 187 Wn. App. at 739. The Court of Appeals avoided addressing whether the PRA statute of limitations should apply and instead determined that Belenski\u2019s claim was time barred under even the longer, two year statute of limitations because \u201cBelenski did not file his complaint until . . . over two years after the County responded\u201d to his request for IALs. Id. Belenski sought review of only this portion of the Court of Appeals decision, which dismissed his PRA claim involving the September 27, 2010 request for IALs as time barred. We granted Belenski\u2019s petition for review. Belenski, 184 Wn.2d 1032.\nII. ANALYSIS\n\u00b67 The PRA is a broad public mandate that allows citizens access to public records. Rental Hous. Ass\u2019n of Puget Sound v. City of Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 535, 199 P.3d 393 (2009) (citing Hearst Corp. v. Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d 123, 127, 580 P.2d 246 (1978)). When a citizen requests public records under the PRA, the agency may respond in one of three ways: produce the records, ask for more time or clarification, or deny the request along with a proper claim of exemption (which requires the agency to identify certain information about the records, list the specific exemptions, and explain how they apply). RCW 42.56.520, .210(3); see also Rental Hous., 165 Wn.2d at 537-38 (explaining requirements for exemption claims). The PRA provides a cause of action for citizens to challenge violations of this act. See RCW 42.56.550. Our standard of review is de novo. Rental Hous., 165 Wn. 2d at 536 (citing RCW 42.56.550(3)).\n\u00b68 Belenski claims the County violated the PRA by inadequately responding to his September 27, 2010 request for IALs. More specifically, he asserts that the County silently withheld records by telling him that the County has \u201cno responsive records\u201d when in fact such records existed. CP at 214. The Court of Appeals held that this claim was time barred. We agree.\n\u00b69 At the outset, we must determine which statute of limitations applies to Belenski\u2019s claim under the PRA. We must then decide when that limitations period was triggered.\n\u00b610 We hold that the trial court incorrectly applied the two year catchall statute of limitations. RCW 42.56.550(6) is the applicable statute of limitations for Belenski\u2019s PRA claim. Although we find that this statute normally begins to run on an agency\u2019s definitive, final response to a PRA request, we remand this case for the trial court to determine whether to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling based on the facts of this case.\nA. RCW 42.56.550(6) establishes a one year statute of limitations for claims under the PRA\n\u00b611 RCW 42.56.550(6) \u201cprovides a one-year statute of limitations for PRA actions.\u201d Rental Hous., 165 Wn.2d at 535. This provision states, \u201cActions under this section must be filed within one year of the agency\u2019s claim of exemption or the last production of a record on a partial or installment basis.\u201d RCW 42.56.550(6).\n\u00b612 The Court of Appeals, concerned that the County\u2019s response in this case did not fall strictly within a claim of exemption or the production of records on an installment basis, did not apply RCW 42.56.550(6) to Belenski\u2019s claim. Instead, the Court of Appeals applied the two year catchall statute of limitations contained in the general chapter on \u201climitation of actions\u201d in Washington\u2019s civil procedure code, which states, \u201cAn action for relief not hereinbefore provided for, shall be commenced within two years after the cause of action shall have accrued.\u201d RCW 4.16.130.\n\u00b613 We hold that the Court of Appeals incorrectly applied the two year catchall statute of limitations to Belen-ski\u2019s claim, rather than the one year statute of limitations that the PRA explicitly provides. By its express statutory terms, RCW 4.16.130 applies only when a time limit is \u201cnot hereinbefore provided for.\u201d But the PRA contains its own statute of limitations in a section titled \u201cJudicial review of agency actions,\u201d RCW 42.56.550, along with a provision stating that the PRA governs in the event it may conflict with any other acts, RCW 42.56.030. Therefore, we adopt the one year statute of limitations in RCW 42.56.550(6) for causes of action under the PRA. Belenski\u2019s claim here falls into that category, as he specifically requested to inspect IALs \u201c[p]ursuant to the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56,\u201d and now challenges the agency\u2019s response as improper under the PRA. CP at 211. We reverse the Court of Appeals in part and hold that RCW 42.56.550(6) is the applicable statute of limitations governing Belenski\u2019s claim under the PRA.\nB. The County\u2019s response may have been sufficient to trigger the PRA statute of limitations, but we remand to the trial court to address equitable tolling\n\u00b614 Having determined that RCW 42.56.550(6) is the applicable statute of limitations, we must next decide whether the County\u2019s response claiming that there were \u201cno responsive records\u201d was sufficient to trigger this provision. CP at 214. We hold that it is, but we remand for the trial court to determine whether equitable tolling under the facts of this case is appropriate.\n\u00b615 Belenski asserts that the one year statute of limitations in RCW 42.56.550(6) begins to run only on two very specific agency responses\u2014either an agency\u2019s claim that records are exempt or the last production of records on an installment basis. But there are many other ways an agency may respond, whether permitted under the statute or not, to a public records request. This highlights a tension in the divisions of the Court of Appeals regarding the appropriate starting point for the statute of limitations when an agency\u2019s response does not fall strictly within the two types of responses listed in RCW 42.56.550(6).\n\u00b616 Division One of the Court of Appeals adopted a strict interpretation of the PRA statute of limitations in Tobin v. Worden, 156 Wn. App. 507, 233 P.3d 906 (2010). In that case, the agency initially responded to a PRA request with a one page document with some redactions. When the requesters made a second request for a copy of a certain anonymous letter, the agency explained that the pertinent information was not contained in a letter, but rather in staff notes from a phone call. The agency provided those notes and stated, \u201c T trust that this responds fully to your public disclosure request.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 511. After the requesters sued the agency for PRA violations, the Court of Appeals held that neither of these agency responses was sufficient to trigger the PRA statute of limitations. Reading RCW 42.56.550(6) narrowly, the court stated that statute \u201cis only triggered by two specific agency responses\u2014a claim of exemption and the last partial production\u2014not simply the agency\u2019s \u2018last\u2019 response.\u201d Id. at 515. The court concluded that neither answer constituted a proper claim of exemption, and because the records were produced all at once and not \u201cpart of a larger set of requested records,\u201d they could not qualify for the disclosure on the partial or installment basis provision of RCW 42.56.550(6). Id. at 514. Therefore, the Court of Appeals held that the statute of limitations did not bar the requesters\u2019 claims.\n\u00b617 Division Two of the Court of Appeals rejected Tobin\u2019s narrow reading of the events sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations. In Bartz v. Department of Corrections Public Disclosure Unit, the court determined that the agency\u2019s single production of records triggered the statute of limitations. 173 Wn. App. 522, 538, 297 P.3d 737 (2013) (citing Johnson v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 164 Wn. App. 769, 777, 265 P.3d 216 (2011)). In rejecting Tobin\u2019s contrary conclusion, Division Two noted that a literal reading of only two triggering events leads to absurd results. Id. at 536-37 (noting it would be absurd to conclude that no statute of limitations applied to PRA actions involving a single production of records or to conclude that \u201cthe legislature intended to create a more lenient statute of limitations for one category of PRA requests in light of its 2005 deliberate and significant shortening of the time for filing a claim from five years ... to one year\u201d).\n\u00b618 We agree that Tobin\u2019s reading of the PRA statute of limitations is too narrow. The statute does not use terms like \u201ceither\u201d or \u201conly\u201d to limit the triggering events, nor does it set forth a definitive list by numbering the events as (1) and (2). Instead, the statute of limitations\u2019 reference to bringing suit within one year of \u201cthe agency\u2019s claim of exemption or the last production of a record on a partial or installment basis\u201d indicates that the legislature intended to impose a one year statute of limitations beginning on an agency\u2019s final, definitive response to a public records request. RCW 42.56.550(6). This theme of finality should apply to begin the statute of limitations for all possible responses under the PRA, not just the two expressly listed in RCW 42.56.550(6). As the court aptly noted in Bartz, to conclude otherwise would lead to absurd results\u2014leaving either no statute of limitations or a different statute of limitations to apply based on how the agency responded.\n\u00b619 In this case, the County gave a final, definitive response to Belenski\u2019s public records request on October 4, 2010, stating that \u201cthe County has no responsive records\u201d relevant to his PRA request for IALs on September 27, 2010. CP at 214. Belenski received this response via e-mail on October 5, 2010. CP at 213. Regardless of whether this answer was truthful or correct, the county\u2019s definitive, final response to Belenski\u2019s PRA request was sufficient to put him on notice that the County did not intend to disclose records or further address this request. If Belenski was unsatisfied with this answer, he could sue to hold the County in compliance with the PRA as soon as it gave this response\u2014there was no need for him to wait an additional 25 months before bringing his cause of action.\n\u00b620 However, Belenski and amici raise legitimate concerns that allowing the statute of limitations to run based on an agency\u2019s dishonest response could incentivize agencies to intentionally withhold information and then avoid liability due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. On one hand, we recognize that such an incentive could be contrary to the broad disclosure mandates of the PRA and may be fundamentally unfair in certain circumstances; on the other hand, certain facts in this specific case indicate that Belenski knew the County possessed IAL data, yet he inexplicably waited over two years before filing his claim. In light of these issues, we remand this case to the trial court to resolve any factual disputes and to determine whether the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to toll the statute of limitations in this case.\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\u00b621 We reverse the portion of the Court of Appeals opinion that applies the two year catchall statute of limitations and hold that the one year PRA statute of limitations, RCW 42.56.550(6), applies to Belenski\u2019s PRA claim. Although we find that this statute of limitations usually begins to run on an agency\u2019s final, definitive response to a PRA request, we remand this case for the trial court to determine whether equitable tolling is appropriate.\nMadsen, C.J., and Owens, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, Gordon McCloud, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nIALs record information relating to contacts between county-issued computers and the Internet websites they visit in the form of \u201c \u2018meta-data.\u2019 \u201d Belenski v.

That case stated that the agency\u2019s initial response to a PRA request, which provided some documents but refused to disclose others, was not sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations because the agency did not follow the proper procedure for claiming exemptions and held that the limitations period did not begin to run until the agency \u201cprovided a privilege log identifying individual records it was withholding under a claim of exemption.\u2019\u2019 Rental Hous., 165 Wn.2d at 528. The holding in Rental Housing was limited to the timeliness of claims when an agency attempts to claim an exemption and discusses how the agency must claim an exemption to begin the limitations period. In contrast, in this case the County never attempted to claim an exemption and, instead, simply stated that it had \u201cno responsive records.\u2019\u2019 Therefore, Rental Housing is distinguishable, and the limitations period here should begin to run on this final, definitive response.",

        "text": "Johnson, J.\n\u00b622 (dissenting) \u2014 The Public Records Act (PRA), chapter 42.56 RCW, is designed to guarantee citizens two rights. First, a requester of public records has the right to inspect public records. Second, a requester has the right to receive an adequate response to his or her request. Both rights were denied here.\n\u00b623 The troubling rule embraced by the majority permits public agencies to deny the existence of public records they hold, and then wait for the clock to expire under a one-year statute of limitations to avoid disclosure. This turns the PRA on its head. I would hold that Jefferson County\u2019s response to Mike Belenski\u2019s public records request was false, the response did not comply with the PRA, the statute of limitations under the PRA was never triggered, and the lawsuit was timely. This court should embrace a rule prohibiting the government from enjoying the protections of the PRA\u2019s statute of limitations when responding falsely to records requests. The majority instead holds the opposite, and for this reason, I respectfully dissent.\n\u00b624 The majority claims the Court of Appeals read the PRA statute of limitations (RCW 42.56.550(6)) too narrowly in Tobin v. Worden, 156 Wn. App. 507, 233 P.3d 906 (2010). Perhaps the holding in Tobin would be too narrowly applied in cases where the government responds truthfully and accurately to a records request, but that is not what happened in Tobin. In that case, the Court of Appeals did nothing more than apply the words of the PRA\u2019s statute of limitations as written. In Tobin, Susan Tobin repeatedly requested from the county copies of any complaints against her property. After her first request, the county sent her a copy of a one-page, handwritten complaint with some portions redacted. When it was sent to Tobin, this document included no corresponding explanation or response from the county.\n\u00b625 Tobin later learned through a county code enforcement officer that additional, anonymous complaints had been made against her property and others. Tobin made another public records request via e-mail:\n\u201cI am requesting a copy of the anonymous letter received by code enforcement on or around 11/24/04 regarding file # E0401001. This letter apparently constituted an additional complaint against this landowner.\u201d\nTobin, 156 Wn. App. at 510. The county responded in a letter:\n\u201cThank you for your public disclosure request, which I received via e-mail on June 2,2005. In your e-mail, you requested a copy of the anonymous letter received by Code Enforcement on or around 11/24/04 regarding Code Enforcement case # E0401001.\n\u201cThe pertinent document is enclosed with this letter. It is not, in fact, a letter from the complainant, but rather the internal staff notes from a phone call placed by the complainant. As you will see, the complainant has requested to remain anonymous.\n\u201cI trust that this responds fully to your public disclosure request. If you have questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.\u201d\nTobin, 156 Wn. App. at 510-11. Tobin wrote back to clarify, informing the county that the record they sent her was not the one she requested. The document she requested was in fact a letter received on November 24, 2004, rather than the internal staff notes. Tobin attached an e-mail from the code enforcement officer that specifically referenced the November 24, 2004 complaint. In response to Tobin\u2019s clarifying letter, the county again responded:\n\u201cI apologize that we erred in properly retrieving the document you originally requested. I am working with [the code enforcement officer] and the Code Enforcement section and I believe that the enclosed letter fulfills your original request.\u201d\nTobin, 156 Wn. App. at 511. However, the enclosed letter was yet another copy of the redacted one-page complaint the county already provided. The county provided no further response to Tobin\u2019s records requests. The court correctly held that the PRA statute of limitations was not triggered \u201c[b]ecause none of the county\u2019s responses to the Tobins\u2019 records requests amount to a claim of exemption or the last production of a record on a partial or installment basis\u201d as required under RCW 42.56.550(6). Tobin, 156 Wn. App. at 515. The same scenario occurred here.\n\u00b626 Jefferson County\u2019s letter indicating there were \u201cno responsive records\u201d failed to satisfy either prong of RCW 42.56.550(6). Clerk\u2019s Papers at 214. The county\u2019s answer was neither a claim of exemption (as was recently detailed in Rental Housing Ass\u2019n of Puget Sound v. City of Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009)) nor the last production of a record on a partial or installment basis.\n\u00b627 The majority rewrites the statute, placing the burden on a public records requester to somehow know when the government\u2019s response is false and bring suit to prove it\u2014a fact a requester can rarely establish. Perhaps in this case, based on Belenski\u2019s history and experiences with the county, that result makes sense. However, the rule the majority creates is statutorily unsupportable and inconsistent with the statutory purpose and provisions. The county here falsely responded, denying that any responsive records existed. The PRA statute of limitations was not \u201ctriggered\u201d by this false response. The Court of Appeals should be reversed.\nStephens, J., concurs with Johnson, J.\nReconsideration denied December 7, 2016.\nThe PRA \u201cshall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed ... to assure that the public interest will be fully protected.\u2019\u2019 RCW 42.56.030.",

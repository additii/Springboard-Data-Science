        "text": "\u00b61 The State charged Joseph McEnroe and Michele Anderson with aggravated first degree murder and seeks a sentence of death for each of them. In January of this year, roughly five and a half years after the State filed its notices of intent to seek the death penalty, the trial court ruled that the absence of \u201c \u2018sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency,\u2019 \u201d RCW 10.95-.060(4), is an essential element of the crime of capital murder in Washington and, hence, that the State must allege the absence of sufficient mitigating circumstances in the charging information. The trial court therefore gave the State two weeks to amend each charging information to allege insufficient mitigating circumstances. The order said that if the State failed to amend the information, the court would entertain a defense motion to dismiss the State\u2019s notices of intent to seek the death penalty.\nGordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b62 The State seeks reversal of that order. It also asks that the case be reassigned to a different trial judge on remand.\n\u00b63 We reverse the trial court\u2019s order compelling the State to amend each information or face dismissal of the notice of special sentencing proceeding. We deny the State\u2019s motion for reassignment.\nFACTS\n\u00b64 In late December 2007, Joseph McEnroe and Michele Anderson (defendants) were charged with six counts of aggravated first degree murder. The State filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty in each case.\nf 5 Under Washington\u2019s death penalty statute, the State must file a notice of its intent to seek the death penalty (the \u201cnotice of special sentencing proceeding\u201d) \u201cwhen there is reason to believe that there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency.\u201d RCW 10.95.040(2), (1). That notice must be filed within 30 days after arraignment unless the court grants an extension. RCW 10.95.040(2). In this case, the trial court granted several extensions and the State did not file the notice until October 2008.\n\u00b66 In November 2012, the defendants moved to dismiss the death penalty notices on the grounds that the prosecutor had violated their constitutional rights when, in determining whether to seek the death penalty, he had considered the strength of the State\u2019s evidence. The trial court granted that motion, and the State sought interlocutory review by this court. The State also moved in the trial court to stay the order until five days after this court issued its decision on the motion for discretionary review. The trial court denied that motion, but the Supreme Court commissioner stayed the effect of the trial court\u2019s order pending review by this court. We ultimately granted review and reversed the trial court. State v. McEnroe, 179 Wn.2d 32, 309 P.3d 428 (2013).\n\u00b67 On October 21, 2013, McEnroe moved the trial court to \u201cpreclude the possibility of a death sentence in this case\u201d on the grounds that the State had failed to allege an essential element in the charging information. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 1-15. Anderson joined in McEnroe\u2019s motion. Under Washington\u2019s death penalty statute, the death penalty cannot be imposed for aggravated murder unless the jury is asked the following question: \u201c \u2018Having in mind the crime of which the defendant has been found guilty, are you convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency?\u2019 \u201d RCW 10.95.060(4). If the jury unanimously answers yes, then the penalty is death. Id.; RCW 10.95.030. If the jury does not unanimously answer yes, then the penalty is life without the possibility of parole. RCW 10.95.030. According to the defendants, this makes the absence of \u201c \u2018sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency\u2019 \u201d an essential element of capital murder in Washington and means that it must be charged in the information. RCW 10.95.060(4).\n\u00b68 The defendants characterized their motion as \u201cbased on\u201d the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Alleyne v. United States,_U.S._, 133 S. Ct. 2151, 186 L. Ed. 2d 314 (2013), the latest in the line of cases beginning with Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000). Apprendi held that for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process, the prosecution must prove to a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, any fact necessary to increase the statutory maximum penalty for the charged crime. Id. at 492; U.S. Const, amends. VI, XTV. The Apprendi decision held that a \u201c \u2018sentencing factor,\u2019 \u201d such as an aggravating circumstance, becomes the \u201cfunctional equivalent of an element\u201d when it triggers the availability of a penalty greater than that authorized for the commission of the underlying crime. 530 U.S. at 494 n.19.\n\u00b69 For many years the United States Supreme Court distinguished, for purposes of the Apprendi rule, between facts that increased the maximum potential sentence and facts that increased only the mandatory minimum sentence. Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 153 L. Ed. 2d 524 (2002). But Alleyne rejected that distinction and held that for purposes of the Apprendi rule, there is no difference between facts that increase the statutory maximum and facts that increase the mandatory minimum. 133 S. Ct. at 2160-63. The prosecution must prove both to the fact finder beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.\nf 10 Alleyne\u2019s holding on that point is irrelevant to this case. If the jury unanimously answers yes to the question in RCW 10.95.060(4), then the death penalty is both a statutory maximum and a statutory mandatory minimum \u2014 it is the only penalty that the trial court can impose.\n\u00b611 But the defendants also argued that Alleyne expanded the definition of an \u201cessential element,\u201d which this court has long required the State to allege in the charging information. CP at 14 (\u201cAlleyne . . . clearly . . . holds that necessary non-statutory elements are not to be distinguished from statutory elements.\u201d). The defense concluded that the absence of sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency must now be considered an essential element and, hence, that it must now be charged in the information.\nf 12 In response to the defendants\u2019 motion, the trial court embarked on an in-depth examination of the interaction between Alley ne and the relevant precedent from this court. On December 5, 2013, the trial court asked the parties to complete a form it called the \u201cCourt\u2019s Requests for Admission.\u201d Id. at 276-77. This novel document consisted of seven questions with blanks indicating that the parties should supply \u201c \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 \u201d answers. Id. The questions asked whether the \u201celements\u201d of first degree murder and aggravated first degree murder are set forth in certain statutes; whether the penalties for those crimes are 240 months to life and life without parole, respectively; and whether, after a jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency, a court must impose a sentence of death on a defendant charged with aggravated first degree murder. Id.\n\u00b613 The State objected to the Court\u2019s Requests for Admission. CP at 101. Instead of supplying yes or no answers to the court\u2019s questions, the State submitted a lengthy brief reframing those questions and arguing that the Apprendi rule does not apply to the ultimate decision in a death penalty case. The State argued that the decision to impose the death penalty is basically a moral, rather than a purely factual, determination and that the decision therefore falls outside the scope of the Apprendi rule. The trial court accepted the State\u2019s brief over the defendants\u2019 objection.\n\u00b614 Then, on January 2, 2014, the trial court entered a written ruling directed to the defendants\u2019 \u201cMotion Based on Alleyne.\u201d CP at 122-29. The ruling was not really an order; it did not \u201cpreclude the possibility of the death penalty\u201d as the defendants had requested, nor did it impose any other relief. It just expressed agreement with the defendants\u2019 theory that \u201cthe absence of sufficient mitigation is an element of the crime for which death is the mandatory punishment.\u201d CP at 129. Both parties then filed additional motions: the State sought reconsideration of the theory adopted by the court, and the defense sought to preclude the State from seeking death sentences.\n\u00b615 On January 31, the court denied both parties\u2019 motions. CP 233-47. Critically, it also gave the State until February 17, 2014, to \u201camend the Information consistent with this Court\u2019s ruling\u201d or relinquish the opportunity to pursue a special sentencing proceeding. CP at 246-47.\n\u00b616 The State filed a motion for discretionary review of that January 31 order in this court and a motion to consolidate the defendants\u2019 cases for review. We granted both motions. State v. McEnroe, 179 Wn.2d 1022, 320 P.3d 719 (2014). Our commissioner granted the State\u2019s emergency motion for a stay of the trial court\u2019s orders pending further order of this court.\nANALYSIS\nI. The trial court erred in ruling that the absence of sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency must be alleged in the charging information\n\u00b617 The trial court ruled, as a matter of law, that the absence of sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency is an element of the crime and that the State must allege that element in the information in order to seek a sentence of death. We review such questions of law de novo. State v. Womac, 160 Wn.2d 643, 649, 160 P.3d 40 (2007).\n\u00b618 As noted above, Apprendi holds that any fact, such as the existence of an aggravating circumstance that exposes the defendant to a sentence greater than the statutory maximum for the crime charged, is the \u201cfunctional equivalent of an element\u201d for right to jury trial and standard of proof purposes. 530 U.S. at 494 n.19. In Alleyne, the United States Supreme Court held that the Apprendi rule also applies to facts that raise the mandatory minimum sentence. 133 S. Ct. at 2160-63. Under both cases, such facts are the \u201cfunctional equivalent [s]\u201d of elements. Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 494 n.19. Alleyne also called such facts actual \u201celements,\u201d as opposed to \u201cfunctional equivalent[s],\u201d for purposes of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment questions at issue in that case. 133 S. Ct. at 2162 (omitting any reference to an element\u2019s \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d).\n\u00b619 Based on this language, the defendants argue that in Washington, all \u201cessential elements of a crime must be alleged in the information\u201d and that post-Alleyne, these \u201cessential elements\u201d include the absence of sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency in a capital case. Am. Resp\u2019t\u2019s Br. at 19, 27 (boldface and capitalization omitted).\n\u00b620 The State disagrees with both arguments. First, it argues that the insufficient mitigation finding is not a factual determination subject to the Apprendi rule. The State points out that the jury can consider even nonfactual, moral issues, such as mercy and leniency, in mitigation. This is certainly true under both state and federal law. The State also relies on federal cases interpreting the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994 (FDPA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3592(c); the State is correct that these cases all hold that the jury\u2019s decision to impose the death penalty under the FDPA is a \u201cweighing\u201d process rather than a factual determination, and is therefore not subject to the Apprendi line of cases or the reasonable doubt standard. The defendants do not really respond to the first argument. They counter the second one by arguing that we cannot analogize Washington\u2019s death penalty statute to the FDPA: Washington\u2019s statute, unlike the FDPA, is not a \u201cweighing\u201d statute; the jury\u2019s insufficient mitigation decision is characterized as a sufficiency-of-evidence determination (which is characteristic of factual questions); and in Washington, the jury\u2019s insufficient mitigation finding is reviewed for sufficiency of the evidence (a standard also characteristic of factual questions). Accordingly, they contend that in Washington, the jury\u2019s decision to impose the death penalty is treated like any other \u201cfact\u201d necessary to conviction.\n\u00b621 Second, the State argues that even if \u201c \u2018not sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency\u2019 \u201d were a factual determination, the Apprendi rule deals with only the rights to trial by jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt and not with the required contents of state charging documents. RCW 10.95.060(4). In support of this argument, the State relies primarily on State v. Siers, 174 Wn.2d 269, 274 P.3d 358 (2012). It asserts that under Siers, the due process clause guarantees a defendant notice of every \u201caggravating circumstance! ]\u201d (that is, every functional equivalent of an element) alleged, but that such notice need not necessarily be given in the charging information itself. Reply Br. of Pet\u2019r at 12-13. The defense counters that all elements must be alleged in the charging instrument itself under Alleyne.\n\u00b622 The State certainly has the better of the charging instrument argument. Neither the Sixth nor the Fourteenth Amendment \u2014 the constitutional provisions at issue in Apprendi and Alleyne \u2014 requires the states to use any particular form of charging instrument. See Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 477 n.3. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\u2019s guaranty of indictment by grand jury is not binding on the states. Id. Hence, states can use their own charging procedures and documents (bounded, of course, by other constitutional guaranties, such as notice, which are not at issue here). The death penalty notices in the two cases before us complied with the state statutory charging requirements of RCW 10.95.040. Each notice alleged that \u201cthere [is] reason to believe that there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency.\u201d RCW 10.95.040(2), (1). While the due process clause requires the states to give criminal defendants constitutionally adequate notice of \u201cthe essential elements of the crimes charged,\u201d Siers held that this notice need not necessarily be afforded in the charging information. 174 Wn.2d at 271, 275-77. Neither party has argued that Siers should be overruled on this state law point. Thus, the State can provide such notice in the notice of special sentencing proceeding under RCW 10.95.040.\n\u00b623 Because we hold that the notice of special sentencing proceeding afforded the defendants statutorily required notice that the State intended to prove the absence of sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency, we do not reach the question of whether the insufficient mitigation finding is a factual determination for purposes of Apprendi. Under state law, it must already be presented to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. RCW 10.95.060(4), .080(1). On the other hand, under state law, the decision-maker can consider mercy, leniency, and other nonfactual matters. We hold only that the notice of special sentencing proceeding satisfied all applicable constitutional and state charging requirements. The trial court therefore erred when it ordered the State to amend the information or relinquish the chance to have a special sentencing proceeding.\nII. The State\u2019s request for reassignment on remand is denied\n\u00b624 For the first time on appeal, the State requested that these cases be reassigned to a different judge on remand. The State contends that reassignment is necessary to preserve the appearance of fairness and because \u201cit can reasonably be expected that the trial court will have difficulty putting aside its strongly held views regarding its erroneous findings.\u201d Opening Br. of Pet\u2019r at 41.\n\u00b625 The State\u2019s motion is based on the trial judge\u2019s conduct of more than six years of pretrial proceedings; his treatment of numerous motions; his discretionary decisions on legal issues not currently before this court on their merits; and his views on several disputed, complex legal matters. Yet the State never asked Judge Ramsdell to recuse himself.\n\u00b626 Generally, a party seeking a new judge files a motion for recusal in the trial court. See, e.g., State v. Chamberlin, 161 Wn.2d 30, 40-41, 162 P.3d 389 (2007). The recusal rule itself is based on the assumption that the challenged judge gets to evaluate the stated grounds for recusal in the first instance. CJC Canon 2.11(A) (\u201c[a] judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d). This recusal procedure allows the parties to develop a record adequate to determine whether \u201cthe judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Id.\n\u00b627 A party may sometimes seek reassignment for the first time on appeal, as the State did here. But that is generally done where the issue raised on appeal is also the basis for the reassignment request. Thus, reassignment may be sought for the first time on appeal where, for example, the trial judge will exercise discretion on remand regarding the very issue that triggered the appeal and has already been exposed to prohibited information, expressed an opinion as to the merits, or otherwise prejudged the issue. This remedy has limited availability: even where a trial judge has expressed a strong opinion as to the matter appealed, reassignment is generally not available as an appellate remedy if the appellate court\u2019s decision effectively limits the trial court\u2019s discretion on remand.\n\u00b628 This case does not involve any exception to the rule that a motion to recuse is generally the proper way to seek a new trial judge. Of the State\u2019s seven asserted grounds for reassignment, six are entirely unrelated to the Alleyne/ Apprendi issue raised in this appeal and none proves that Judge Ramsdell has prejudged the merits of this case or the propriety of any particular sentence.\n\u00b629 The one asserted ground for reassignment that does relate to the Alleynel Apprendi issue appealed does not warrant reassignment. With respect to that asserted ground, the State argues that reassignment is warranted because, in ruling on the Alleynel Apprendi issue, Judge Ramsdell \u201cignored binding precedent.\u201d Opening Br. of Pet\u2019r at 44. This argument fails for three reasons. First, legal errors alone do not warrant reassignment. See Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S. Ct. 1147, 127 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1994) (\u201cAlmost invariably, [erroneous rulings] are proper grounds for appeal, not for recusal.\u201d). Second (and relatedly), our decision today leaves no discretion in the hands of the trial court as to the Alleynel Apprendi issue appealed. Thus, as to that issue, there is simply no basis for the State\u2019s assertion that Judge Ramsdell will have trouble \u201cputting aside [his] strongly held views.\u201d Opening Br. of Pet\u2019r at 41. Even if Judge Ramsdell holds \u201cstrongly held views\u201d about the contents of charging documents, he is bound on remand by this court\u2019s decision. Id.\n\u00b630 Finally, the State\u2019s assertion that Judge Ramsdell \u201cignored binding precedent\u201d on this issue is not correct. Id. at 44 (emphasis added). The binding precedent to which the State refers is Siers, 174 Wn.2d 269, and, as this opinion makes clear, we agree with the State\u2019s interpretation of that case. But Siers arguably stands in tension with our earlier decision in State v. Goodman, on which the trial court relied. See 150 Wn.2d 774, 784, 83 P.3d 410 (2004) (\u201cA charging document is constitutionally sufficient under the sixth amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 22 of our constitution only if it includes all \u2018essential elements\u2019 of the crime, regardless of whether they are statutory or nonstatutory.\u201d (footnotes omitted)). Moreover, the State did not develop the theory that Siers was the dispositive case until it filed its motion for reconsideration in the trial court. Before it filed that motion, the State never treated Siers as controlling. Instead, it called the case \u201cinstructive,\u201d Verbatim Tr. of Proceedings (Dec. 18,2013) at 26, and argued that it \u201creinforce [d] the State\u2019s position here,\u201d CP at 95.\n\u00b631 This is understandable, given the evolution of our post -Apprendi opinions. We have yet to fully weave Apprendi into the fabric of our case law, and some of our cases distinguish in broad terms between \u201celements\u201d and \u201csentence enhancers,\u201d State v. Yates, 161 Wn.2d 714, 757-58, 168 P.3d 359 (2007), or between \u201celements\u201d and \u201c \u2018aggravation of penalty\u2019 factors,\u201d State v. Kincaid, 103 Wn.2d 304, 307, 692 P.2d 823 (1985). To the extent that these distinctions appear in cases addressing state charging documents, they are consistent with Apprendi\u2019s result. But the reasoning underlying these distinctions derives from pre-Apprendi case law. Compare, e.g., Siers, 174 Wn.2d at 282 (asserting, without qualification, that \u201can aggravating factor is not the functional equivalent of an essential element\u201d), with Alleyne, 133 S. Ct. at 2155 (\u201c[a]ny fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).\n\u00b632 The trial court\u2019s reading of these cases is not evidence of willful disregard of precedent. It may result in legal error, but an error of law is certainly not evidence of bias.\n\u00b633 Thus, the general rule requiring parties to raise recusal issues in the trial court, rather than in this court, applies to most of the State\u2019s requests for reassignment. The remaining ground for seeking reassignment is a legal error, and a legal error alone does not warrant reassignment. We deny the State\u2019s request for reassignment on remand. We do so, however, without prejudice to the State\u2019s ability to file a motion for recusal in the trial court. That is the proper place to raise some of these highly fact-dependent claims in the first instance.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b634 We hold that the notice of special sentencing proceeding afforded the defendants constitutionally and statutorily adequate notice that the State intended to prove the absence of sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency. The trial court\u2019s order directing the State to amend the charging information is therefore reversed. The State\u2019s request for reassignment on remand is denied without prejudice to the State\u2019s ability to bring a motion for recusal in the trial court.\nMadsen, C.J., and C. Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nReconsideration denied November 5, 2014.\nSee, e.g., State v. Kjorsvik, 117 Wn.2d 93, 97, 812 P.2d 86 (1991).\nIn re Pers. Restraint of Yates, 177 Wn.2d 1, 53-54, 296 P.3d 872 (2013) (\u201c[T]he statutory question, fairly read, does not require a nexus between mitigating circumstances and the crime. The term \u2018mitigating circumstance\u2019 is broadly defined to include \u2018a fact about either the offense or about the defendant which in fairness or in mercy may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of moral culpability or which justifies a sentence of less than death, although it does not justify or excuse the offense.\u2019 \u201d).\nLockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1978) (plurality opinion) (under Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution a jury must \u201cnot be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record ... that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death\u201d).\nE.g., United States v. Gabrion, 719 F.3d 511, 532-33 (6th Cir. 2013) (Apprendi and the reasonable doubt standard apply only to factual findings, not to the weighing of aggravators and mitigators), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1934 (2014); United States v. Fields, 483 F.3d 313, 345-46 (5th Cir. 2007) (same).\nCompare RCW 10.95.130(2)(a) (\u201cWith regard to the sentence review [in a death penalty case], the supreme court of Washington shall determine . . . [w]hether there was sufficient evidence to justify the affirmative finding to the question posed by RCW 10.95.060(4).\u201d), with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3595(c)(2) (requiring reviewing court in FDPA case to consider three things: (1) whether the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, (2) whether the evidence supports the special finding of the existence of the required aggravating factor (but not the determination that aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors), and (3) whether the proceedings involved any other legal error requiring reversal of the death sentence).\nE.g., State v. Stenson, 132 Wn.2d 668, 757, 940 P.2d 1239 (1997) (\u201cThe test to review the sufficiency of the evidence [of insufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency in death penalty case] is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found sufficient evidence to justify that conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).\nIn response to questions from this court at oral argument, the State filed a motion requesting to supplement the clerk\u2019s papers by designating the notice of special death penalty proceedings filed in each defendant\u2019s case. We grant that motion.\nState v. Harrison, 148 Wn.2d 550, 559, 61 P.3d 1104 (2003); In re Ellis, 356 F.3d 1198, 1211 (9th Cir. 2004); State v. Madry, 8 Wn. App. 61, 70, 504 P.2d 1156 (1972).\nState v. Sledge, 133 Wn.2d 828, 846, 947 P.2d 1199 (1997); United States v. Quach, 302 F.3d 1096, 1103-04 (9th Cir. 2002); State v. Aguilar-Rivera, 83 Wn. App. 199, 203, 920 P.2d 623 (1996); In re Custody of R., 88 Wn. App. 746, 763, 947 P.2d 745 (1997); State v. Talley, 83 Wn. App. 750, 763, 923 P.2d 721 (1996), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 134 Wn.2d 176, 949 P.2d 358 (1998).\nE.g., United States v. Wolf Child, 699 F.3d 1082, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2012) (trial court\u2019s previously expressed view that defendant \u201ccategorically presented a danger to all children\u201d not grounds for reassignment where appellate opinion \u201cgives sufficient guidance that, should [the trial judge] determine it is necessary to impose new conditions [of supervised release] he will impose only suitably narrow conditions that will comply with the applicable legal requirements set forth above\u201d).\nThe State asserted two of these grounds for reassignment for the first time in its reply brief. (We note that RAP 10.3(c) does not contemplate that parties will raise new arguments in a reply brief.) In response, the defendants filed a motion to supplement the designation of clerk\u2019s papers with four \u201cdocuments relevant to refuting new allegations made by the State . . . regarding \u2018Reassignment Upon Remand,\u2019 \u201d Mot. To Suppl. Resp\u2019ts\u2019 Designation of Clerk\u2019s Papers at 1, and one document that was \u201coverlooked in [the defendants\u2019] original designation of clerk\u2019s papers (Sub. No. 587),\u201d Resp\u2019ts\u2019 Reply on Mot. To Suppl. Resp\u2019ts\u2019 Designation of Clerk\u2019s Papers. The State filed a motion in opposition. Because we hold that none of the State\u2019s allegations, even if true, is a proper basis for reassignment as an appellate remedy, we deny the defendants\u2019 motion to supplement the clerk\u2019s papers as to the four documents relevant to that issue. We grant the defendants\u2019 motion to supplement the clerk\u2019s papers as to the document that was overlooked (Sub. No. 587). We note that that document was appended to the State\u2019s motion for discretionary review, that it has therefore been before this court for several months, and that we have given it full consideration in this opinion.\nThe State asserts the following six grounds for reassignment that are unrelated to th e Alleynel Apprendi issue: (1) Judge Ramsdell dismissed the notices of special sentencing proceeding in January 2013 for reasons ultimately rejected by this court; (2) after dismissing the notices of special sentencing proceeding in 2013, Judge Ramsdell refused to stay that order until five days after this court ruled on the State\u2019s motion for discretionary review; (3) Judge Ramsdell directed the parties to fill out the document titled \u201cRequest for Admissions\u201d; (4) Judge Ramsdell cited Albert Camus when he opined that it was ironic that, if the strength of the State\u2019s evidence is relevant to the decision to seek the death penalty, a defendant who confesses is more likely to face that penalty; (5) that Judge Ramsdell unreasonably delayed the proceedings by allowing defendant Anderson\u2019s lawyers to withdraw early on; and (6) that Judge Ramsdell incorrectly interpreted King County Local General Rule 15. Opening Br. of Pet\u2019r at 44-49.\nWe acknowledge that the State believes Judge Ramsdell harbors a bias against the death penalty. But none of the State\u2019s allegations indicate that Judge Ramsdell\u2019s personal views \u2014 whatever they might be \u2014 led him to prejudge the merits of the State\u2019s case or the propriety of any sentence.\nSee Opening Br. of Pet\u2019r at 38 (faulting trial court for declining to follow Siers, asserting that it did so \u201cbecause it is a 5-4 decision\u201d).\nIn particular, it derives from the \u201cessential elements\u201d rule articulated in Kjorsvik, 117 Wn.2d at 97.",

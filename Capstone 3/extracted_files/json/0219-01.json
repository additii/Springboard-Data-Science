        "text": "Stephens, J.\n\u00b61 Under the Washington State Medical Use of Cannabis Act (MUCA), chapter 69.51A RCW, qualifying patients may participate in \u201ccollective gardens\u201d to pool resources and grow medical marijuana for their own use. RCW 69.51A.085d). However, MUCA grants cities and towns the power to zone the \u201cproduction, processing, or dispensing\u201d of medical marijuana. RCW 69.51A.140(1). Given this state law, the city of Kent enacted a zoning ordinance that prohibits collective gardens within its city limits. City of Kent Ordinance 4036 (June 5, 2012) (codified at Kent City Code 15.02.074 and 15.08.290) (Ordinance).\n\u00b62 This case requires us to determine whether MUCA preempts the Ordinance. We hold it does not and affirm the Court of Appeals. The Ordinance is a valid exercise of the city of Kent\u2019s zoning authority recognized in RCW 69.51A-.140(1) because the Ordinance merely regulates land use activity.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA\n\u00b63 In 1971, the Washington Legislature enacted the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, chapter 69.50 RCW. That statute made it a crime to manufacture, deliver, and possess marijuana. RCW 69.50.401-.445. The same activities are criminalized under federal law. 21 U.S.C. ch. 13. But Washington has had subsequent legal developments concerning medical marijuana and recreational marijuana. In 1998, the people adopted Initiative 692, Laws of 1999, ch. 2, to provide protections for medical marijuana use. And in 2012, the people adopted Initiative 502, Laws of 2013, ch. 3, to create a system for the licensed distribution of recreational marijuana and to legalize the possession of marijuana in certain circumstances. See RCW 69.50.4013(3). Initiative 502 is not relevant to this case because no party seeks to produce marijuana pursuant to a recreational marijuana producer\u2019s license. See RCW 69.50.325(1). This case concerns Washington\u2019s medical marijuana system.\n\u00b64 Washington\u2019s medical marijuana system is codified as MUCA, chapter 69.51 A RCW. Initially, the statute provided qualifying medical marijuana users an affirmative defense to criminal prosecutions. Former RCW 69.51A-.040(2)-(3) (2010). That defense was satisfied upon compliance with the terms of the chapter, such as meeting the definition of being a \u201cqualifying patient,\u201d having \u201cvalid documentation\u201d from a \u201chealth care professional,\u201d having the appropriate quantity of marijuana, and satisfying other conditions. Id.; former RCW 69.51A.010(2) (2010).\n\u00b65 The legislature amended MUCA in 2011. See Laws of 2011, ch. 181. But the bill the legislature passed differs significantly from the enacted law because Governor Gregoire vetoed 36 of the bill\u2019s 58 sections. See id. at 1374-76 (governor\u2019s veto message). As passed by the legislature, the bill would have created a comprehensive regulatory scheme under which all patients, physicians, processors, producers, and dispensers could be securely and confidentially registered in a database maintained by the Washington Department of Health. See id. \u00a7 901 (later vetoed). Registration would have been optional. Id. \u00a7 901(6) (later vetoed). If a patient registered, the patient would not be subject to state prosecution or civil consequences for marijuana-related offenses. Id. \u00a7 401 (codified at RCW 69.51A.040). But if the patient did not register, the patient would be entitled to only an affirmative defense to marijuana prosecutions. Id. \u00a7 402 (codified at RCW 69.51A.043).\n\u00b66 In addition to the registration system, the bill authorized collective gardens and clarified that local jurisdictions retain their zoning power over medical marijuana activities. Under the bill, qualifying patients could establish collective gardens for the purpose of growing medical marijuana for personal use. Id. \u00a7 403 (codified at RCW 69.51A-.085). Participating in a collective garden involves \u201csharing responsibility for acquiring and supplying the resources required to produce and process cannabis for medical use,\u201d such as by providing real estate, equipment, supplies, or labor for the collective garden. Id. \u00a7 403(2) (codified at RCW 69.51A.085(2)). Last, the bill clarified that local governments retain authority to regulate the production, processing, or dispensing of medical marijuana through zoning, business licensing, health and safety requirements, and business taxes. Id. \u00a7 1102 (codified at RCW 69.51A.140).\n\u00b67 After the legislature passed the bill and sent it to Governor Gregoire for her approval, the United States attorneys for the Eastern and Western Districts of Washington wrote the governor a letter. It warned that the legislature\u2019s bill authorized conduct illegal under federal law, noted that Washington State employees who administered the registry would not be immune from federal prosecution, and threatened such prosecution. Cannabis Action Coal. v. City of Kent, 180 Wn. App. 455, 464, 322 P.3d 1246 (2014). Governor Gregoire vetoed all of the bill\u2019s sections that could have subjected state employees to federal charges, most importantly the establishment of the bill\u2019s centerpiece, the registration system. She did not veto the provision concerning collective gardens, RCW 69.51A-.085, or the provision concerning local zoning requirements, RCW 69.51 A. 140. She explained her decision in an official veto message. Laws of 2011, ch. 181, at 1374-76.\n\u00b68 Against this state law backdrop, in 2012, the city of Kent enacted the Ordinance at issue. Styled as a zoning ordinance, it prohibits collective gardens (largely as defined in RCW 69.51A.085) in every zoning district within the city and deems any violation a nuisance per se that shall be abated by the city attorney. Kent City Code 15.02.074; Kent City Code 15.08.290. The city may enforce the Ordinance with criminal and civil sanctions. Ch. 1.04 Kent City Code.\nB\n\u00b69 The Cannabis Action Coalition, Steve Sarich, Arthur West, John Worthington, and Deryck Tsang (collectively plaintiffs) sued the city of Kent, its city council, and its mayor Suzette Cook (collectively Kent) in King County Superior Court, seeking to have the Ordinance declared preempted and invalid. On competing motions for summary judgment, the superior court ruled in Kent\u2019s favor and upheld the Ordinance. It also dismissed the claims of Sarich, West, and Worthington for lack of standing because these plaintiffs did not reside or operate a collective garden in the city of Kent. The court determined that Tsang had standing because he currently participates in a collective garden in the city of Kent\u2019s limits. The court enjoined all plaintiffs from violating the Ordinance.\n\u00b610 Sarich, Worthington, and Tsang appealed. Recognizing that Tsang\u2019s standing to appeal was never in doubt, the Court of Appeals held that Sarich and Worthington also had standing to appeal because they were burdened by the trial court\u2019s injunction prohibiting them from violating the Ordinance. Cannabis Action Coal., 180 Wn. App. at 469 n.11. On the merits, the Court of Appeals affirmed the superior court and held state law does not preempt the Ordinance. Id. at 469-83. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petitions for review. Cannabis Action Coal. v. City of Kent, 181 Wn.2d 1022, 336 P.3d 1165 (2014).\nII. ANALYSIS\nA\n\u00b611 The Washington Constitution grants every local government the power to \u201cmake and enforce within its limits all such local police, sanitary and other regulations as are not in conflict with general laws.\u201d Wash. Const, art. XI, \u00a7 11. This court has established that an ordinance is valid under this provision \u201cunless: (1) the Ordinance conflicts with some general law; (2) the Ordinance is not a reasonable exercise of the [local government\u2019s] police power; or (3) the subject matter of the Ordinance is not local.\u201d Weden v. San Juan County, 135 Wn.2d 678, 692-93, 958 P.2d 273 (1998). Under this test, \u201ca heavy burden rests upon the party challenging [the ordinance\u2019s] constitutionality\u201d and \u201c \u2018[e]very presumption will be in favor of constitutionality.\u2019 \u201d HJS Dev., Inc. v. Pierce County, 148 Wn.2d 451, 477, 61 P.3d 1141 (2003) (quoting Lenci v. City of Seattle, 63 Wn.2d 664, 668, 388 P.2d 926 (1964)). \u201cWhether an ordinance is reasonable, local, or conflicts with a general law for purposes of article XI, section 11 is purely a question of law subject to de novo review.\u201d Weden, 135 Wn.2d at 693.\n\u00b612 The plaintiffs do not contend that the Ordinance is unreasonable or nonlocal. They contend only that MUCA is a general law in conflict with the Ordinance \u2014 i.e., that MUCA preempts the Ordinance. A state statute may preempt a local ordinance in two ways: it will \u201cpreempt[ ] an ordinance on the same subject if the statute occupies the field, leaving no room for concurrent jurisdiction, or if a conflict exists such that the statute and the ordinance may not be harmonized.\u201d Lawson v. City of Pasco, 168 Wn.2d 675, 679, 230 P.3d 1038 (2010).\nB\n\u00b613 A statute preempts the field and invalidates a local ordinance within that field \u201cif there is express legislative intent to preempt the field or if such intent is necess\u00e1rily implied ... from the purpose of the statute and the facts and circumstances under which it was intended to operate.\u201d Id. Because MUCA has no express preemption clause, we must consider whether field preemption is implied.\n\u00b614 We have recognized that when a state statute expressly provides for local jurisdiction over a subject, state law does not impliedly preempt the field of that subject. In Lawson, we held the Manufactured/Mobile Home Landlord-Tenant Act (MHLTA), chapter 59.20 RCW, did not preempt a local ordinance that prohibited recreational vehicles in mobile home parks. Lawson, 168 Wn.2d at 677. We reasoned that the MHLTA did not preempt the field of manufactured/mobile home regulations because \u201ccertain provisions of the MHLTA expressly contemplate some local regulation of manufactured/mobile home tenancies.\u201d Id. at 680. Likewise here, MUCA expressly contemplates local regulation of medical marijuana. It provides that cities and towns may adopt and enforce \u201cany of the following pertaining to the production, processing, or dispensing of cannabis or cannabis products within their jurisdiction: Zoning requirements, business licensing requirements, health and safety requirements, and business taxes.\u201d RCW 69.51A-.140(1). Given this express state law recognition of local jurisdiction over medical marijuana regulation, we must conclude that MUCA does not impliedly preempt the field of medical marijuana. Lawson, 168 Wn.2d at 680.\nC\n\u00b615 Under our conflict preemption precedents, a state law preempts a local ordinance \u201cwhen an ordinance permits what state law forbids or forbids what state law permits.\u201d Id. at 682. We will find state law to preempt an ordinance only if the ordinance \u201c \u2018directly and irreconcilably conflicts with the statute.\u2019 \u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting HJS Dev., Inc., 148 Wn.2d at 482). Though the rule may be easily stated, the analysis is often nuanced. Compare, e.g., Entm\u2019t Indus. Coal. v. Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dep\u2019t, 153 Wn.2d 657, 105 P.3d 985 (2005), and Parkland Light & Water Co. v. Tacoma-Pierce County Bd. of Health, 151 Wn.2d 428, 90 P.3d 37 (2004), with Lawson, 168 Wn.2d 675, and Weden, 135 Wn.2d 678.\n\u00b616 Whether MUCA conflicts with the Ordinance turns on the scope of Kent\u2019s power to zone medical marijuana activities under RCW 69.51A.140(1). Kent argues RCW 69.51A. 140(1) authorizes the Ordinance because the Ordinance is a zoning regulation of \u201cthe production, processing, or dispensing\u201d of medical marijuana. The plaintiffs respond that RCW 69.51A.140(1) is irrelevant to collective gardens because RCW 69.51A. 140(1) applies only to \u201ccommercial producers, processors, or dispensaries that would have been licensed under the proposed regulatory scheme.\u201d Tsang\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 17. Thus, in the plaintiffs\u2019 view, MUCA irreconcilably conflicts with the Ordinance because MUCA grants a right to engage in a collective garden under RCW 69.51A.085, yet the Ordinance prohibits the same activity. Ultimately, Kent is correct. A city\u2019s zoning power under RCW 69.51A.140(1) is not limited to commercial, licensed producers. RCW 69.51A.140(l)\u2019s plain text, and its statutory context, demonstrate that it provides local jurisdictions the authority to enact zoning requirements pertaining to the land use activity of participating in a collective garden.\n\u00b617 RCW 69.51A.140(l)\u2019s relevant text draws no distinction between commercial and noncommercial operations. Its terms are undefined, so we give them their plain and ordinary meaning. Ravenscroft v. Wash. Water Power Co., 136 Wn.2d 911, 920-21, 969 P.2d 75 (1998). The plain and ordinary meaning of RCW 69.51A.140(l)\u2019s provision that a city may adopt zoning requirements for the \u201cproduction, processing, or dispensing\u201d of medical marijuana provides no reason to limit these concepts to only commercial activities. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 653 (2002) (defining \u201cdispense\u201d to include \u201cto deal out in portions : distribute, give, provide\u201d; \u201cto deal with : handle\u201d; and \u201cto prepare and distribute (medicines) to the sick\u201d); id. at 1808 (defining \u201cprocess\u201d to include \u201cto subject to a particular method, system, or technique of preparation, handling, or other treatment designed to effect a particular result\u201d), 1810 (defining \u201cproduce\u201d to include \u201cto . . . create, or bring out by intellectual or physical effort\u201d). No doubt these words can carry a commercial meaning, but they can also carry the broader meanings quoted above. Because the legislature chose to use these capacious words without providing textual limitations to them, such as \u201ccommercial production\u201d or \u201clicensed production,\u201d we give effect to the broad meaning of the words chosen. Someone growing medical marijuana in a collective garden \u201cproducfes],\u201d \u201cprocesses],\u201d and \u201cdispens[es]\u201d (RCW 69.51A.140(1)) medical marijuana just the same as someone in a commercial operation does, albeit not to seek a profit but rather to grow, share, and use the marijuana within the small community of collective garden participants.\n\u00b618 Indeed, elsewhere RCW 69.51A. 140(1) does distinguish between licensed and nonlicensed producers. In a later sentence not directly at issue here, RCW 69.51A-.140(1) provides that a city\u2019s zoning requirements cannot \u201cpreclude the possibility of siting licensed dispensers within the jurisdiction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Yet RCW 69.51A-.140(l)\u2019s first sentence, which is at issue in this case, makes no limitation that a city\u2019s zoning requirements pertaining to the \u201cproduction, processing, or dispensing\u201d of medical marijuana must be limited to only \u201clicensed dispensers.\u201d Where the language of a statute differs, we presume the difference is intentional and give the difference effect. State v. Tracer, 173 Wn.2d 708, 718, 272 P.3d 199 (2012). Accordingly, the statute\u2019s first sentence is not limited to zoning requirements over only licensed producers.\n\u00b619 The statutory context also refutes the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that a city\u2019s zoning powers under RCW 69.51A-.140(1) do not include imposing zoning requirements for collective gardens. Under MUCA, a collective garden exists when individuals \u201cparticipate in collective gardens for the purpose of producing, processing, transporting, and delivering cannabis for medical use.\u201d RCW 69.51A.085(1) (emphasis added). Thus, because RCW 69.51A.140(1) authorizes a city to enact zoning requirements pertaining to the \u201cproduction\u201d and the \u201cprocessing\u201d of medical marijuana, and because collective gardens are defined to include \u201cproducing\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d medical marijuana, the statutory context strongly confirms that a city\u2019s power under RCW 69.51A.140(1) is not limited to commercial or licensed producers but also includes noncommercial collective gardens. State v. Coley, 180 Wn.2d 543, 553, 326 P.3d 702 (2014) (noting that we must consider the context of the statute, related provisions, and the statutory scheme as a whole).\n\u00b620 In sum, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that RCW 69.51A.140(1) reaches only commercial activities. Instead, this provision recognizes that a city may enact zoning requirements pertaining to all production, processing, and dispensing of medical marijuana.\n\u00b621 The remaining question is whether the Ordinance is otherwise consistent with state law. Because the legislature ensured that cities have the power to adopt \u201czoning requirements\u201d \u2014 but did not grant carte blanche to opt out of all medical marijuana activity \u2014 a city\u2019s ordinance under RCW 69.51A. 140(1) must concern a land use. Here, the Ordinance does concern a land use. It adopts zoning requirements for \u201cthe growing, production, processing, transportation, and delivery of cannabis\u201d in a collective garden, if seven conditions defining a collective garden are satisfied. Kent City Code 15.02.074; Kent City Code 15.08.290. As Kent concedes, the Ordinance does \u201cnot address personal use of medical marijuana.\u201d Suppl. Br. of City of Kent at 4. Instead, the Ordinance concerns only collective gardens wherein up to 10 individuals pool resources to grow medical marijuana in potentially large operations of up to 45 plants and 75 ounces of usable marijuana. Kent City Code 15.02.074(A)-(C). Tsang reports that his collective garden is \u201clocated within leased property at the north end of... an area zoned Ml for Industrial Park. The building is safe and secured with 24-hour video surveillance, alarm monitoring, electric striking door, and neighbors ... a private security firm.\u201d Tsang\u2019s Pet. for Review at 6. Such an operation to produce marijuana, potentially on a large scale, is a land use activity. Accordingly, Kent has properly exercised its authority under RCW 69.51A.140(1) to zone the land use activity involving collective gardens. The Ordinance is consistent with state law and is not preempted.\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\u00b622 Consistent with RCW 69.51A.140(1), a city may adopt zoning requirements pertaining to the land use activity of collective gardens. The Ordinance falls within this local authority and is not preempted by state law. We affirm the Court of Appeals.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Wiggins, Gordon McCloud, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nWhile this appeal was pending, the legislature enacted comprehensive reform concerning the regulation of medical marijuana in Washington. Laws of 2015, ch. 70. That new law repeals the two statutory provisions at issue in this case. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 48 (repealing RCW 69.51A.140), 49 (repealing RCW 69.51A.085). This opinion concerns the law as it existed prior to the 2015 enactment. All references to statutes in this opinion refer to the statutes as they existed prior to the 2015 enactment.\nThough vetoed by Governor Gregoire, the legislature\u2019s original bill defined \u201cdispense,\u201d \u201cprocess,\u201d and \u201cproduce\u201d in their broadest sense. See Laws op 2011, ch. 181, \u00a7 201(8), (21), (23); id. ch. 181, at 1374 (governor\u2019s veto message). The vetoed definition of \u201cprocess\u201d (\u201cto handle or process cannabis in preparation for medical use\u201d) and of \u201cproduce\u201d (\u201cto plant, grow, or harvest cannabis for medical use\u201d) plainly are not limited to a commercial context. Id. \u00a7 201(21), (23). And the vetoed definition of \u201cdispense\u201d (\u201cthe selection, measuring, packaging, labeling, delivery, or retail sale of cannabis by a licensed dispenser to a qualifying patient or designated provider\u201d) also includes various activities that occur in the noncommercial context of a collective garden, for example measuring and packaging marijuana. Id. \u00a7 201(8). Moreover, its definition expressly uses \u201clicensed dispensers\u201d as a modifier of only one meaning of \u201cdispense,\u201d not the others. Id. Nonetheless, we need not and cannot rely on these definitions because upon being vetoed, they \u201c \u2018now mean[ ] nothing whatsoever. In exercising the veto power, the governor acts as a part of the legislative bodies, and the act is to be considered now just as it would have been if the vetoed provisions had never been written into the bill at any stage of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d Hallin v. Trent, 94 Wn.2d 671, 677, 619 P.2d 357 (1980) (quoting State ex rel. Stiner v. Yelle, 174 Wash. 402, 408, 25 P.2d 91 (1933)).\nAs Governor Gregoire noted in her veto statement, it appears true that RCW 69.51A.140(l)\u2019s second sentence \u2014 i.e., that zoning requirements cannot preclude the possibility of licensed dispensers within the jurisdiction \u2014 is \u201cwithout meaning in light of the vetoes of sections providing for such licensed dispensers.\u201d Laws op 2011, ch. 181, at 1375. Nonetheless, the governor\u2019s choice to not veto the entire section of RCW 69.51A.140 signifies that she intended the remaining portions to retain their natural effect. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 view that the entirety of RCW 69.51A.140 \u201cis an orphaned section without effect,\u201d Tsang\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 17, we will not interpret the rest of the section in a manner that renders it superfluous, In re Pers. Restraint of McWilliams, 182 Wn.2d 213, 217, 340 P.3d 223 (2014). In other words, had Governor Gregoire intended that a local jurisdiction\u2019s zoning power cover only licensed operations and not cover nonlicensed collective gardens, she simply would have vetoed the entire section. But she did not do so, demonstrating that she intended local jurisdictions to have the power to zone nonlicensed medical marijuana land uses. Indeed, elsewhere in her veto statement, Governor Gregoire endorsed local zoning of medical marijuana. Laws of 2011, ch. 181, at 1376 (stating she remains open to new exemptions from state prosecutions, \u201cconditioned on compliance with local government location and health and safety specifications\u201d (emphasis added)).\nFor example, the first condition in the Ordinance\u2019s definition of a \u201ccollective garden\u201d is that no more than 10 qualifying patients may participate in the collective garden. Kent City Code 15.02.074(A). If 11 qualifying patients were to participate in a collective garden in the city of Kent, the Ordinance would not govern the activity. Thus, Kent correctly concedes that in scenarios where the Ordinance\u2019s definition of a \u201ccollective garden\u201d is not met, only state law enforcement would be able to prosecute the activity (for potentially exceeding RCW 69.51A.085\u2019s authorized definition of a \u201ccollective garden\u201d). See Wash. Supreme Court oral argument, Sarich v. City of Kent, No. 90204-6 (Feb. 24, 2015), at 24 min., 26 sec. through 25 min. 3 sec., audio recording by TVW, Washington State\u2019s Public Affairs Network, http://www.tvw.org.\nFor the same reasons we conclude that RCW 69.51A.140(1) authorizes the Ordinance, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that RCW 69.51A.085 grants a \u201cstand alone\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d right to engage in a collective garden. Also given our conclusion under RCW 69.51A.140G), we need not determine here whether medical marijuana use is \u201cillegal subject to an affirmative defense\u201d or is generally \u201clegal\u201d under state law.",

        "text": "Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\n\u00b623 (dissenting) \u2014 I agree with the majority that under the Washington State Medical Use of Cannabis Act (MUCA), chapter 69.51A RCW, \u201ca city may enact zoning requirements pertaining to all production, processing, and dispensing of medical marijuana.\u201d Majority at 231. But while a city may regulate consistent with MUCA, it may not completely ban what the state permits. Since the majority concludes otherwise, I respectfully dissent.\n\u00b624 As the majority recognizes, \u201cstate law preempts a local ordinance \u2018when an ordinance permits what state law forbids or forbids what state law permits.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 227 (quoting Lawson v. City of Pasco, 168 Wn.2d 675, 682, 230 P.3d 1038 (2010)). The majority declines to determine whether participation in collective gardens is \u201c \u2018illegal subject to an affirmative defense\u2019 \u201d or is generally \u201c \u2018legal\u2019 \u201d under state law. Id. at 232 n.5. Instead, the majority holds that \u201c[b]ecause the legislature ensured that cities have the power to adopt \u2018zoning requirements\u2019 \u2014 but did not grant carte blanche to opt out of all medical marijuana activity \u2014 a city\u2019s ordinance under RCW 69.51A. 140(1) must concern a land use.\u201d Id. at 231. Finding that City of Kent Ordinance 4036 (June 5, 2012) (codified at Kent City Code 15.02.074 and 15.08.290) (Ordinance) concerns a land use, the majority deems the Ordinance constitutional. Id. While the majority\u2019s sweeping analysis is logical, the simple fact is that this Ordinance \u201cforbids what state law permits.\u201d Lawson, 168 Wn.2d at 682. While cities may make zoning regulations that apply to collective gardens, completely prohibiting state protections related to them, whether done directly or in the guise of a zoning regulation, goes too far.\n\u00b625 In cases in which the legislature intended to allow local governments to completely prohibit activities allowed by the state, the legislature has been clear. See, e.g., Edmonds Shopping Ctr. Assocs. v. City of Edmonds, 117 Wn. App. 344, 356, 71 P.3d 233 (2003) (analyzing RCW 9.46.295, which allows local governments to \u201cabsolutely prohibit\u201d state-licensed gambling activities). Given that \u201c \u2018[e]very presumption will be in favor of constitutionality\u2019 \u201d of a local ordinance, MUCA\u2019s lack of clarity on this issue is not dispositive here. HJS Dev., Inc. v. Pierce County, 148 Wn.2d 451, 477, 61 P.3d 1141 (2003) (quoting Lenci v. City of Seattle, 63 Wn.2d 664, 668, 388 P2d 926 (1964)). A further analysis shows, however, that the Ordinance is nonetheless unconstitutional.\n\u00b626 If MUCA grants a right to participate in collective gardens, the Ordinance is unconstitutional. A local ordinance is unconstitutional when state law specifically entitles one to engage in an activity prohibited by the local ordinance. See Entm\u2019t Indus. Coal. v. Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dep\u2019t, 153 Wn.2d 657, 664, 105 P.3d 985 (2005) (finding that a local ordinance imposing a complete ban on smoking was invalid because it \u201cprohibits what is permitted by state law: the ability of certain business owners and lessees to designate smoking and nonsmoking locations in their establishments\u201d); Parkland Light & Water Co. v. Tacoma-Pierce County Bd. of Health, 151 Wn.2d 428, 433, 90 P.3d 37 (2004) (finding that a local ordinance requiring water fluoridation \u201cis a local regulation that prohibits what state law permits: the ability of water districts to regulate the content and supply of their water systems expressly granted to them by statute\u201d). If MUCA provides a right for people to participate in collective gardens, the Ordinance improperly denies that right and therefore is unconstitutional.\n\u00b627 I recognize that generally, when the state creates a licensing system for participation in an activity but does not provide an entitlement to engage in that activity, a local ordinance may completely prohibit that activity. \u201cThe fact that an activity may be licensed under state law does not lead to the conclusion that it must be permitted under local law\u201d Rabon v. City of Seattle, 135 Wn.2d 278, 292, 957 P.2d 621 (1998); see Weden v. San Juan County, 135 Wn.2d 678, 958 P.2d 273 (1998). For example, in State ex rel. Schillberg v. Everett District Justice Court, we found that a county ordinance completely prohibiting the use of internal combustion motors on certain lakes in the county did not irreconcilably conflict with a state statute setting out licensing requirements for using internal combustion motors on lakes because the statute did not provide that people are entitled to use internal combustion motors on all waters of the state. 92 Wn.2d 106, 108, 594 P.2d 448 (1979). Similarly, in Weden, we found that a state statute setting forth license requirements for operating motorized personal watercraft did not grant the right to operate such watercraft on all waters of the state and, therefore, a county was able to completely prohibit the operation of such watercraft in the county. 135 Wn.2d at 694-95.\n\u00b628 Unlike the licensing provisions at issue in Schillberg and Weden, however, even if MUCA provides that participation in collective gardens is protected only as an affirmative defense, the affirmative defense is provided to all Washington citizens and a local ordinance may not eliminate that protection. MUCA provides in relevant part that\n[a] qualifying patient or designated provider who is not registered with the registry established in section 901 of this act, but who presents his or her valid documentation to any peace officer who questions the patient or provider regarding his or her medical use of cannabis, may assert an affirmative defense to charges of violations of state law relating to cannabis ....\nRCW 69.51A.043(2) (reviser\u2019s note omitted). Clearly participation in collective gardens, addressed in RCW 69.51A.085, is one of the \u201cviolations of state law relating to cannabis\u201d protected by an affirmative defense in RCW 69.51A.043(2).\n\u00b629 The city of Kent, its city council, and its mayor (collectively Kent) argue that, as the Court of Appeals found, because medical marijuana is generally illegal under state law, a city may entirely prohibit the activity because \u201c[w]ithout question, a municipality\u2019s plenary powers include the power to \u2018enact ordinances prohibiting and punishing the same acts which constitute an offense under state laws.\u2019 \u201d Cannabis Action Coal. v. City of Kent, 180 Wn. App. 455, 482, 322 P.3d 1246 (2014) (quoting City of Bellingham v. Schampera, 57 Wn.2d 106, 109, 356 P.2d 292 (1960) and citing State v. Kirwin, 165 Wn.2d 818, 826-27, 203 P.3d 1044 (2009)); see Suppl. Br. of City of Kent at 7. Neither Schampera nor Kirwin address a local ordinance that prohibits what is also an offense under state law but concurrently eliminates a state law affirmative defense. Here, Kent intends to enforce the Ordinance with criminal and civil sanctions and warned Deryck Tsang that it may \u201cseek civil and/or criminal remedies in the courts\u201d in relation to his collective garden, without allowing the MUCA affirmative defense to be raised. Clerk\u2019s Papers at 732-33; ch. 1.04 Kent City Code. Furthermore, the Ordinance renders MUCA\u2019s affirmative defense to state prosecution worthless because a collective garden participant who operates illegally loses the protection of the affirmative defense and the Ordinance causes all collective garden participation in the city of Kent to be illegal. RCW 69.51A-.085(3). The Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis is flawed because it overlooks that the Ordinance not only prohibits participation in collective gardens, it also eliminates a state law right to assert an affirmative defense in relation to participation in collective gardens. By eliminating the MUCA affirmative defense available to all Washington citizens, the Ordinance unconstitutionally \u201cforbids what state law permits.\u201d Lawson, 168 Wn.2d at 682.\nReconsideration denied July 16, 2015.\n\u00b630 Kent may not eliminate protection provided by the state. Accordingly, I would reverse the Court of Appeals and I respectfully dissent.\nThe Weden majority did not yield to the dissent\u2019s position that \u201c[w]here a state statute licenses a particular activity, counties may enact reasonable regulations of the licensed activity within their borders but they may not prohibit same outright\u201d because an ordinance banning the activity \u201crenders the state permit a license to do nothing at all.\u201d Weden, 135 Wn.2d at 720, 722 (Sanders, J., dissenting).",

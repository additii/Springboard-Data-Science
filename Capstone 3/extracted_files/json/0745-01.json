        "text": "Johnson, J.\n\u00b61 This case involves whether a juvenile disposition condition requiring K.H.-H.\u2014who was adjudicated guilty of fourth degree assault with sexual motivation\u2014to write an apology letter to the victim violates his constitutional free speech rights. U.S. Const, amend. I. We hold that it does not.\nFacts and Procedural History\n\u00b62 K.H.-H., a 17-year-old male, was charged with assault with sexual motivation after he forced himself on C.R., a female acquaintance who attended the same high school. K.H.-H. and C.R. were sitting on C.R.\u2019s bed when K.H.-H. began to kiss her on the face and neck. She responded by telling K.H.-H. to \u201cchill it or to back off.\u201d Verbatim Tr. of Proceedings (Aug. 13, 2013) (VTP) at 29. Undeterred, K.H.-H. pushed C.R. onto her back, leaned over her, and began biting her neck. C.R. protested, tried to push K.H.-H. away, and told him to \u201cstop\u201d and to get off her, and that it hurt. VTP at 35. K.H.-H. \u201cpushed his weight down more on [her] hands,\u201d reached under her shirt and bra in an attempt to touch her breasts, and reached into and \u201ctr[ied] to undo [her] pants.\u201d VTP at 32, 33. C.R. grabbed her cell phone and threatened to call her father, prompting K.H.-H. to leave the house. C.R. noticed bruises on her neck from the bites and showed the marks to her friend, J.S. J.S. confronted K.H.-H. about the incident and then informed a school official.\n\u00b63 The State charged K.H.-H. with two counts of fourth degree assault with sexual motivation: one for the incident with C.R. and another for an incident involving a different girl. The juvenile court adjudicated K.H.-H. guilty on the count involving C.R. and not guilty on the count involving the other girl. At the disposition hearing, the State requested the court order K.H.-H. to address to C.R. \u201ca sincere written letter of apology ... meanfing] an admission that he did what he was accused of what he\u2019s [sic] doing and [is] sorry he put her in that position.\u201d VTP at 149. Defense counsel objected to this condition, insisting that K.H.-H. maintained the right to control his speech.\n\u00b64 The juvenile court sentenced K.H.-H. to three months of community supervision and also ordered K.H.-H. to \u201cwrite a letter of apology to victim C.R. that is approved by the Probation Officer and the State.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 42. K.H.-H. appealed his conviction and sentence, arguing in part that the apology letter requirement violated his rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to be free from compelled speech.\n\u00b65 The Court of Appeals affirmed the sentence, holding that the apology letter was permissible under United States v. Clark, 918 F.2d 843 (9th Cir. 1990), overruled on other grounds by United States v. Keys, 133 F.3d 1282 (9th Cir. 1998), because the apology letter requirement served the State\u2019s compelling interest in rehabilitating juvenile offenders. State v. K.H.-H., 188 Wn. App. 413, 421, 353 P.3d 661 (2015).\n\u00b66 This court granted K.H.-H.\u2019s petition for review of the condition requiring him to write the apology letter. State v. K.H.-H., 184 Wn.2d 1010, 360 P.3d 817 (2015).\nAnalysis\n\u00b67 This court has never addressed the question of whether it is a violation of the First Amendment or our own article I, section 5 of the Washington Constitution to order a juvenile defendant in a criminal case to write a letter of apology.\n\u00b68 The First Amendment prohibits states from \u201cabridging the freedom of speech.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. I; see Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 666, 45 S. Ct. 625, 69 L. Ed. 1138 (1925). The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe right of freedom of thought protected by the First Amendment against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.\u201d Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714, 97 S. Ct. 1428, 51 L. Ed. 2d 752 (1977). The protection from compelled speech extends to statements of fact as well as of opinion. Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 62, 126 S. Ct. 1297, 164 L. Ed. 2d 156 (2006). Article I, section 5 of the Washington Constitution guarantees that \u201c[e]very person may freely speak, write and publish on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right.\u201d K.H.-H. does not advocate an independent state constitutional analysis but instead argues our cases articulate a First Amendment analysis distinct from that applied in Clark. The issue here centers on the protection from government-compelled speech.\n\u00b69 Because a forced apology involves making an offender say something he does not wish to say, it implicates the compelled speech doctrine. The compelled speech doctrine generally dictates that the State cannot force individuals to deliver messages that they do not wish to make. See, e.g., Wooley, 430 U.S. 705 (the State may not compel individuals to display on their vehicles a license plate motto with which they disagree); W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 63 S. Ct. 1178, 87 L. Ed. 1628 (1943) (a compelled flag salute and pledge of allegiance in public schools violates the First Amendment).\n\u00b610 First Amendment rights are not absolute, however, particularly in the context of prison and probation, where constitutional rights are lessened or not applicable. Similarly, criminal convictions result in loss or lessening of constitutional rights. Because of this, we find Wooley and Barnette are inapplicable in the present case, as they define the boundaries of free speech for those not convicted of crimes. While the Supreme Court has never addressed anything related to the constitutionality of a probation con-ition that implicates an individual\u2019s right to free speech, the federal circuit courts have reviewed this issue and analyzed it under similar situations. The Court of Appeals in the present case relied on the analysis used by the Second and Ninth Circuits as articulated in Clark in deciding that the disposition did not violate the First Amendment. See K.H.-H., 188 Wn. App. at 423.\n\u00b611 Most analogous to the facts here, in Clark the trial court imposed a probation condition requiring two former police officers convicted of perjury to publish apologies for their crimes, which they denied having committed. The officers posited that the apology requirement violated their First Amendment right to refrain from speaking. In rejecting this argument, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged the broad discretion a sentencing judge has in setting probation conditions, reasoning that \u201ceven where preferred rights are affected, [the test] is \u2018whether the limitations are primarily designed to affect the rehabilitation of the probationer or insure the protection of the public.\u2019\u201d Clark, 918 F.2d at 848 (quoting United States v. Consuelo-Gonzalez, 521 F.2d 259, 265 n.14 (9th Cir. 1975)). When applying the analysis from Clark, a court asks whether the sentencing judge imposed the conditions for permissible purposes and then determines whether the conditions are reasonably related to those purposes. Clark, 918 F.2d at 848.\n\u00b612 Asserting that Washington\u2019s case law requires more than the ostensible reasonably related standard articulated in Clark, K.H.-H. cites State v. Bahl, 164 Wn.2d 739, 757-58, 193 P.3d 678 (2008). Bahl concerned a constitutional vagueness challenge to a community custody condition that the defendant not possess or access pornographic materials, imposed under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981, chapter 9.94A RCW. Bahl, 164 Wn.2d at 743.\n\u00b613 In Bahl, this court held that sentence conditions that implicate free speech rights must be narrowly tailored to serve an important government interest and must be reasonably necessary to achieving that interest. Bahl, 164 Wn.2d at 757. The State argued in Bahl that Washington law required that sentencing conditions be only \u201ccrime-related\u201d to be valid. This court held that both federal and state law required more connection (or nexus) before conditions that infringe on constitutional rights may be imposed. In our analysis, we referred to the analysis in Malone v. United States, 502 F.2d 554, 556 (9th Cir. 1974), which held that \u201cfreedom of association may be restricted if reasonably necessary to accomplish the essential needs of the state and public order.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We concluded that the restriction on accessing or possessing pornographic materials at issue was unconstitutionally vague. Since Bahl involved a vagueness analysis, where the inquiry also focuses on notice concerns, it is of little relevance here. Even if one were to equate the two approaches, we would uphold the condition here.\n\u00b614 Although Clark and Bahl use different words and terms, they both embrace a somewhat similar approach of looking at the underlying purpose of the act as well as the nature of the crime in determining whether the condition is appropriate. The principles anchoring the analysis in both cases can be traced to the same source. The origins of the \u201creasonably related\u201d analysis utilized in Clark come from the case Consuelo-Gonzalez, which analyzed the scope of constitutional protections available to probationers that were subject to limitations under the federal Probation Act, ch. 521, 43 Stat. 1259 (1925). Consuelo-Gonzalez, 521 F.2d at 264-65. In evaluating the federal Probation Act\u2019s underlying purpose of rehabilitation, the court recognized that the development of a sensible probationary system \u201crequires that any condition which is imposed following conviction, whether or not it touches upon \u2018preferred\u2019 rights, must be viewed in the context of the goals underlying the Act.\u201d Consuelo-Gonzalez, 521 F.2d at 265 n.14. The court held that fundamental rights may be limited if they are imposed sensitively and with a \u201ckeen appreciation\u201d that the limitation serve the purpose of the underlying act. Consuelo-Gonzalez, 521 F.2d at 265.\n\u00b615 Both Clark and Bahl cite back to Consuelo-Gonzalez, but Bahl fashioned its analysis from Riley and Malone. Bahl, 164 Wn.2d at 757 (quoting State v. Riley, 121 Wn.2d 22, 37, 846 P.2d 1365 (1993) (citing Malone, 502 F.2d at 556; Consuelo-Gonzalez, 521 F.2d at 265)); Clark, 918 F.2d at 847-48 (citing Consuelo-Gonzalez, 521 F.2d at 264-65). Additionally, the court in Bahl\u2014whose inquiry was focused on a vagueness challenge\u2014briefly mentioned the analysis from Malone in the context of providing an example to refute the State\u2019s claim that probationary conditions in Washington need only be crime related. The language in Malone refers to the constitutionality of a condition that restricts an individual\u2019s freedom of association. Furthermore, the case on which Malone relies, Birzon v. King, 469 F.2d 1241, 1243 (2d Cir. 1972), states that \u201cthe Government can infringe the first amendment rights of prisoners so long as the restrictions are reasonably and necessarily related to the advancement of some justifiable purpose of imprisonment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\u00b616 The result under either analysis is the same. Looking at the exact language of Clark, the court articulated a framework for determining the validity of probation conditions, stating:\nThe test for validity of probation conditions, even where preferred rights are affected, is \u201cwhether the limitations are primarily designed to affect the rehabilitation of the probationer or insure the protection of the public.\u201d [Consuelo-Gonzalez, 521 F.2d] at 265, n. 14. To apply this test, our court \u201cmust determine whether the sentencing judge imposed the conditions for permissible purposes, and then it must determine whether the conditions are reasonably related to the purposes.\u201d United States v. Terrigno, 838 F.2d 371, 374 (9th Cir. 1988). \u201c[T]he standard for determining the reasonable relationship between probation conditions and the purposes of probation is necessarily very flexible precisely because \u2018of our uncertainty about how rehabilitation is accomplished.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting Consuelo-Gonzalez, 521 F.2d at 264.\nClark, 918 F.2d at 848 (second alteration in original). The court held that because neither officer had admitted guilt or taken responsibility for their actions, the condition would serve a rehabilitative purpose and was proper as it was reasonably related to the federal Probation Act\u2019s purpose of rehabilitation. Clark, 918 F.2d at 848 (\u201c \u2018It is almost axiomatic that the first step toward rehabilitation of an offender is the offender\u2019s recognition that he was at fault.\u2019\u201d (quoting Gollaher v. United States, 419 F.2d 520, 530 (9th Cir. 1969))). The apology condition was also related to the underlying crime: the defendants were public servants who betrayed the public\u2019s trust through acts of dishonesty. Under the framework of Clark, we can conclude a valid probation condition is one that is related to one of the purposes of the act\u2014in this case, rehabilitation\u2014and is done to effectuate that purpose. Clark embraces the idea that a trial court has wide discretion in fashioning conditions that serve a rehabilitative purpose. We agree with that analysis.\n\u00b617 While Clark is more analogous to the present case because it involved a challenge to an apology condition whereas Bahl involved a constitutional vagueness challenge, the result in applying the analytical framework from Bahl to the present case is the same. The analysis from Bahl states,\nA condition that constitutes a \u201c[1] imitation [ ] upon fundamental rights\u201d is \u201cpermissible, provided [it is] imposed sensitively.\u201d Riley, 121 Wn.2d at 37. In accord with the federal rule, a convict\u2019s First Amendment right \u201c \u2018may be restricted if reasonably necessary to accomplish the essential needs of the state and public order.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 37-38 (quoting Malone v. United States, 502 F.2d 554, 556 (9th Cir. 1974)). Thus, conditions may be imposed that restrict free speech rights if reasonably necessary, but they must be sensitively imposed. This meshes with the vagueness doctrine\u2019s principle that where the challenged law involves First Amendment rights, a greater degree of specificity may be demanded. Here, for example, Bahl may be restricted in the material he may access or possess, but the restrictions implicating his First Amendment rights must be clear and must be reasonably necessary to accomplish essential state needs and public order.\nBahl, 164 Wn.2d at 757-58 (alterations in original).\n\u00b618 Even under Bahl\u2019s somewhat different language, an apology letter condition would be upheld. The apology letter condition is specific and concrete. In the context of the present case, we find the condition is related to the crime of which the offender was convicted and furthers the reformation and rehabilitation of the juvenile, the purpose of the underlying act.\n\u00b619 Under the Juvenile Justice Act of 1977 (JJA), chapter 13.40 RCW, no dispute exists that juvenile rehabilitation is an underlying purpose of the act. See, e.g., RCW 13.40.010; State v. J.A., 105 Wn. App. 879, 886, 20 P.3d 487 (2001) (the JJA seeks a balance between rehabilitation and retribution, and the purposes of accountability and punishment must at times give way to the purpose of responding to the needs of the juvenile); State v. Bennett, 92 Wn. App. 637, 644, 963 P.2d 212 (1998) (\u201cthe JJA is designed to foster rehabilitation as well as accountability of offenders\u201d). Additionally, a victim has an interest in receiving a letter of apology. The apology letter condition primarily aims to rehabilitate the juvenile offender but also acknowledges the victim\u2019s interest in receiving the apology.\n\u00b620 This conclusion is consistent with the statutory goals that identify measures that may be used to effectuate the purpose of rehabilitation. As part of the disposition order, juvenile courts are permitted to enter \u201clocal sane-tions.\u201d RCW 13.40.160, .0357. Such sanctions include \u201c0-12 months of community supervision.\u201d RCW 13.40.020(18)(b). \u201cCommunity supervision\u201d is defined as \u201can individualized program\u201d during a probationary period that includes \u201c[m]on-itoring and reporting requirements.\u201d RCW 13.40.020(5)(c). \u201c \u2018Monitoring and reporting requirements\u2019 \u201d authorize the court to enter \u201cother conditions or limitations as the court may require which may not include confinement.\u201d RCW 13.40.020(20) (emphasis added).\n\u00b621 Juvenile courts are permitted wide latitude and discretion in imposing conditions in a disposition order. This makes sense given that juveniles are, by their very nature, still developing. The JJA recognizes the differences between adults and juveniles and embraces rehabilitation as a primary goal rather than a focus primarily on punishment. Because of this, we hold that a juvenile court can impose and require reasonable conditions that are related to the crime of which the offender was convicted and that further the reformation and rehabilitation of the juvenile.\n\u00b622 Under the broad authority and discretion given to juvenile courts to craft dispositions that adhere to the legislative intent of rehabilitation and crime-relatedness, the juvenile court in the present case ordered K.H.-H. to \u201cwrite a letter of apology to victim C.R. that is approved by the Probation Officer and the State.\u201d CP at 42; see State v. D.H., 102 Wn. App. 620, 629, 9 P.3d 253 (2000) (\u201cThe juvenile court has considerable discretion to fashion an individualized rehabilitative disposition that includes a broad range of community supervision conditions.\u201d). The record in this case supports our conclusion that the juvenile court imposed the letter of apology condition for the purpose of rehabilitating K.H.-H. Specifically, the court was concerned that K.H.-H. refused to accept the consequences of his harmful conduct. The trial court discussed K.H.-H.\u2019s \u201cpattern of bad behavior with women\u201d and pattern of \u201cbeing disrespectful to women\u201d and that the court had grown increasingly concerned after having heard the testimony from the two young victims. VTP at 154, 156. The court ordered this condition in an effort to address this type of behavior and help K.H.-H. understand that his actions were harmful to young women.\n\u00b623 A letter of apology demonstrates a recognition and acceptance of responsibility for harmful actions. Such a condition is reasonably necessary for K.H.-H. to recognize what he did was wrong and to acknowledge his behavior.\n\u00b624 Additionally, an apology letter recognizes the victim\u2019s interest in receiving an apology from the perpetrator. An apology allows the victim to hear an acceptance of responsibility from the very person who inflicted the harm. This is particularly important where both the victim and perpetrator are juveniles, and demonstrates to both the significance of giving and receiving an apology for wrongful acts. This further advances the rehabilitative goals of the statute.\n\u00b625 The outward manifestation of accepting and apologizing for the consequences of one\u2019s actions is a rehabilitative step that attempts to improve K.H.-H.\u2019s character and outlook. Such a condition is reasonably related to the purpose of K.H.-H.\u2019s rehabilitation and the crime here.\n\u00b626 One must face the consequences of a conviction, which often include the loss or lessening of constitutional rights. There is a whole range of constitutional rights that can be affected by a conviction, not the least of which is a loss of liberty. There may be a limitation on the degree to which First Amendment rights may be restricted for those convicted of crimes, but an apology letter condition does not approach that limit. We affirm.\nMadsen, C.J., and Owens, Stephens, Wiggins, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nK.H.-H. also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, an issue not before this court.\nSee O\u2019Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 348, 107 S. Ct. 2400, 96 L. Ed. 2d 282 (1987) (\u201c \u2018[L] awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.\u2019\u201d (quoting Price v.

        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b627 (dissenting) I agree with the majority that the First Amendment ordinarily bars the government from compelling us to speak in favor of a viewpoint that is against our beliefs. Majority at 748-49; U.S. Const, amend. I. I also agree with the majority that forcing someone to utter a confession and apology that he or she does not, in his or her heart, believe constitutes compelled speech and thus would ordinarily violate this First Amendment protection. Majority at 749. Finally, I agree with the majority that a criminal defendant can be deprived of this fundamental right in certain circumstances. Id.\n\u00b628 My agreement with the majority, however, ends there. The majority holds that the government can compel a juvenile offender to speak against his deeply held personal beliefs whenever the government thinks that it would be reasonable. See majority at 750. But controlling Supreme Court precedent developed in the most analogous context\u2014 that is, the First Amendment rights of prison inmates against government-compelled speech\u2014holds that the government cannot deprive the convict of that right without an important government interest. Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 413, 94 S. Ct. 1800, 40 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1974), overruled in part by Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 413-14, 109 S. Ct. 1874, 104 L. Ed. 2d 459 (1989) (overruling Martinez as to incoming mail into a prison because it implicates prison safety concerns, but not as to the prisoner\u2019s own outgoing correspondence, where no such safety concerns exist). Here, that prerequisite is satisfied: rehabilitation of the juvenile is certainly an important government interest. But the First Amendment also requires the government to choose a narrowly tailored means of achieving its permissible interest before compelling a juvenile to endorse a viewpoint. See id.; State v. Bahl, 164 Wn.2d 739, 757, 193 P.3d 678 (2008). That prerequisite is lacking in this case. Compelling a false apology for a crime the defendant denies committing is far from the least restrictive means of achieving rehabilitation. In fact, it is probably the most ineffective way to achieve that result. I therefore respectfully dissent.\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\u00b629 Following a bench trial, the juvenile court adjudicated K.H.-H., then a 17-year-old male, guilty of fourth degree assault with sexual motivation against a female classmate. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 51; Verbatim Tr. of Proceedings (VTP) (Aug. 28, 2013) at 142. Despite this disposition, K.H.-H. maintains his innocence. VTP (Aug. 28, 2013) at 150.\n\u00b630 During the disposition hearing, the court ordered as a condition of probation that K.H.-H. \u201c[s] hall write a letter of apology to victim C.R. that is approved by the Probation Officer and the State.\u201d CP at 52. To obtain the State\u2019s approval, the letter needs to be a \u201csincere written letter of apology ... meaning] an admission that he did what he was accused of what he\u2019s doing and sorry he put her in that position.\u201d VTP (Aug. 28, 2013) at 149 (emphasis added). The court explained its reasoning for imposing this condition as follows:\nI don\u2019t know anything about you, other than what was presented in court, and my concern is, I don\u2019t want you to get in trouble again, and my concern is about what, as I said, what I see as a pattern of, I guess, being disrespectful to women. They\u2019re[] both much younger than you were, and that\u2019s of concern to me. So I want to make sure that there\u2019s some counseling to at least address that, and to be able to, I think that you have a lot of respect for your mother, I don\u2019t have any question about that, but in terms of peers who are younger than you, they warrant respect. So that\u2019s going to be my ruling.\nId. at 156-57. Defense counsel expressly objected to this condition, arguing that K.H.-H. maintained a right to control his speech and declare his innocence even after the court\u2019s disposition. Id. at 150-51. K.H.-H. contends the forced apology violates his freedom of speech under the First Amendment and article I, section 5 of the Washington Constitution.\nANALYSIS\nA. The State Ordinarily Cannot Compel Speech in Support of a Particular Viewpoint Absent the Strictest of Necessity\n\u00b631 The majority correctly observes that this exact question is one of first impression for this court and the United States Supreme Court. Majority at 748. But we are not without guidance. Outside the context of probation conditions, compelled speech is generally unconstitutional. This is because \u201c[i]f there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\u201d W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642, 63 S. Ct. 1178, 87 L. Ed. 1628 (1943).\n\u00b632 This protection against compelled speech applies even when the expression would seem unobjectionable to most of us. E.g., id. at 641-42 (compulsory salute and pledge to the national flag); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 97 S. Ct. 1428, 51 L. Ed. 2d 752 (1977) (compulsory display of state motto on vehicle license plate). This is because the very purpose of the First Amendment is to \u201cprotect! ] the right of individuals to hold a point of view different from the majority and to refuse to foster... an idea they find morally objectionable.\u201d Wooley, 430 U.S. at 715. The State, therefore, must generally present a compelling need before it can force a person to speak.\n\u00b633 The Supreme Court has adopted two tests for analyzing the constitutionality of compelled speech. In Wooley, the compelled speech at issue was the compulsory display of New Hampshire\u2019s state motto, \u201c \u2018Live Free or Die,\u2019 \u201d on vehicle license plates. Id. at 706-07. The Maynards challenged this motto as repugnant to their moral, religious, and political beliefs as members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses faith. Id. at 707. In striking down New Hampshire\u2019s compulsory display law, the Supreme Court held that such laws must be narrowly tailored to achieve a legitimate and substantial governmental purpose. Id. at 716. According to the Supreme Court, \u2018\u201c[t]he breadth of legislative abridgment must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose.\u2019\u201d Id. at 716-17 (quoting Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 488, 81 S. Ct. 247, 5 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1960)).\n\u00b634 The Supreme Court adopted an even more protective First Amendment test in Barnette where, as here, the government compelled not just the passive display of speech but the express affirmation of a viewpoint\u2014and did so with juveniles. Barnette, 319 U.S. at 633. In Barnette, the West Virginia State Board of Education adopted a resolution requiring students to salute the American flag and \u201c \u2018pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands; one Nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 628-29. The board made no exceptions, not even for the young Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Id. at 628. The Court struck down the resolution as unconstitutional. It explained that the government cannot command such an involuntary affirmation unless it is narrowly tailored to address a clear and present danger. Id. at 633-34.\n\u00b635 The majority does not dispute that forced apologies are generally unconstitutional under Barnette. It contends that a different, less protective test applies when the compulsion to speak is part of a criminal sentence or juvenile disposition. Majority at 749-50.1 agree, but the test the majority adopts strips away so many protections that it undermines the core holding of Barnette and conflicts in principle with decisions on free speech in the prison and probation context from both this court and sister jurisdictions.\nB. The Supreme Court Has Applied Strict Scrutiny to Content-Based Restrictions on Free Speech Even in the Prison Context\n\u00b636 We all agree that convicted and incarcerated persons can be deprived of many rights, including constitutional rights. Majority at 749. Indeed, as the Supreme Court has explained, it is a \u201cfamiliar proposition that \u2018[1]awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.\u2019\u201d Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822, 94 S. Ct. 2800, 41 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1974) (alteration in original) (quoting Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S. Ct. 1049, 92 L. Ed. 1356 (1948)).\n\u00b637 But this does not mean that an inmate loses all of his or her First Amendment rights at the prison door. Instead, the Supreme Court has held that even an imprisoned adult \u201cretains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his [or her] status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.\u201d Id. Such objectives certainly include deterrence and rehabilitation. Id. at 822-23.\n\u00b638 The Supreme Court, however, has never held that the goal of rehabilitation, alone, permits the judge or jailor to compel inmate or probationer speech with a specified content. Indeed, in Pell the Court was careful to distinguish content-neutral prison regulations that limit the avenues of communication available to inmates from prison regulations that limit the content of the prisoner\u2019s own speech. Id. at 824. According to the Court, as long as the \u201crestriction operates in a neutral fashion, without regard to the content of the expression, it falls within the \u2018appropriate rules and regulations\u2019 to which \u2018prisoners necessarily are subject.\u2019\u201d Id. at 828 (quoting Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 321, 92 S. Ct. 1079, 31 L. Ed. 2d 263 (1972)). In contrast, prison restrictions that limit the content of an inmate\u2019s own communications \u201cmust further an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression\u201d and \u201cthe limitation of First Amendment freedoms must be no greater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved.\u201d Martinez, 416 U.S. at 413. \u201cThus a [content-based] restriction on inmate correspondence that furthers an important or substantial interest of penal administration will nevertheless be invalid if its sweep is unnecessarily broad.\u201d Id. at 413-14.\n\u00b639 Compelling speech that voices a specific viewpoint is obviously a content-based restriction. Riley v. Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Blind of N. C., 487 U.S. 781, 795, 108 S. Ct. 2667, 101 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1988). This is because \u201c[m]andating speech that a speaker would not otherwise make necessarily alters the content of the speech.\u201d Id. Thus, it follows that Martinez\u2014 not Pell\u2014should apply in the context of a prison regulation compelling speech with a specified viewpoint, and would require that such regulation be narrowly tailored to meet an important or substantial governmental interest. It also logically follows that we cannot choose a test that is less protective of the First Amendment where, as here, the offender who is compelled to confess and apologize is not an imprisoned adult but a released juvenile offender.\nC. This Court Has Applied a Similar Important-Interest, Narrow-Tailoring Test to Content-Based Probation Conditions\n\u00b640 Perhaps for that reason, this court has applied a similar test to probation conditions. As we explained in Bahl, \u201cA [community custody] condition that constitutes a \u2018[1] imitation[ ] upon fundamental rights\u2019 is \u2018permissible, provided [it is] imposed sensitively.\u2019\u201d 164 Wn.2d at 757 (most alterations in original) (quoting State v. Riley, 121 Wn.2d 22, 37, 846 P.2d 1365 (1993)). This, we explained, means \u201ca convict\u2019s First Amendment right \u2018 \u201cmay be restricted if reasonably necessary to accomplish the essential needs of the state and public order.\u201d\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Riley, 121 Wn.2d at 37-38 (quoting Malone v. United States, 502 F.2d 554, 556 (9th Cir. 1974))). The decision we quoted, Malone, said that an even more protective test would likely apply if the First Amendment rights at issue were freedom of speech or religion, as opposed to the freedom of association at issue there. Malone, 502 F.2d at 556 (\u201cThe courts strive to protect freedom of speech, religion and racial equality, but freedom of association may be restricted if reasonably necessary to accomplish the essential needs of the state and public order.\u201d). Thus, the majority correctly cites Bahl as requiring that probation conditions limiting free speech \u201cbe narrowly tailored to serve an important government interest and must be reasonably necessary to achieving that interest.\u201d Majority at 751; Bahl, 164 Wn.2d at 757.\n\u00b641 In spite of quoting and crediting that Bahl test, the majority declines to apply it. But it is our most recent case in the most analogous context, and it is neither incorrect nor harmful; hence, it remains controlling (and persuasive) authority. Bahl holds that a probation condition like the one in this case violates the First Amendment unless it both serves an \u201cimportant government interest\u201d and is \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d and \u201cnecessary to achieving that interest.\u201d If the majority really applied that test here, the probation condition could not survive. According to the juvenile court, the governmental purpose for ordering K.H.-H. to write a letter of apology was to address K.H.-H.\u2019s pattern of disrespect toward younger women. VTP (Aug. 28, 2013) at 156-57. But the juvenile court could have addressed this concern without infringing on K.H.-H.\u2019s First Amendment rights\u2014and could have done so far more effectively. For example, the court could have required K.H.-H. to write an essay on the lifelong effects that rape has on young victims. Instead, the court ordered K.H.-H. to write a letter of apology that includes a confession of wrongdoing. See CP at 52; VTP (Aug. 28, 2013) at 149. This is not narrowly tailored or necessary. As the Supreme Court has explained, it is one thing to provide education that tends to inspire a specific belief; it is another to short-cut this effort altogether with the substitution of a compulsory statement. Barnette, 319 U.S. at 631.\n\u00b642 Not surprisingly, no one\u2014not even the State\u2014argues that the apology requirement imposed by the juvenile court in this case was a narrowly tailored means or \u201cnecessary\u201d to achieve the permissible goal of rehabilitation. The majority\u2019s decision to affirm shows that it is implicitly rejecting Bahl. Majority at 756.\n\u00b643 In fact, the majority acknowledges that Bahl describes the First Amendment test using very different language from the language the majority ultimately borrows from Clark (see supra Part D below). Majority at 751. As discussed above, under Bahl, probation conditions that infringe on a defendant\u2019s First Amendment rights must be \u201creasonably necessary to accomplish the essential state needs and public order.\u201d 164 Wn.2d at 758. The majority dismisses Bahl\u2019s express requirement that the condition be \u201creasonably necessary\u201d as requiring no more than a \u201creasonable relationship\u201d among the imposed condition, the underlying crime, and a sentencing purpose. See majority at 755-56. But that is not what Bahl says. Bahl says the condition must be \u201cnecessary.\u201d This language cannot be set aside as superficial or cosmetic. It is constitutionally required in this context.\nD. The Majority Adopts the Least Protective Test\n\u00b644 In the place of the Bahl test, the majority adopts the least protective test\u2014a highly deferential, rational-relationship test. Majority at 750, 755 (deferring to the sentencing court\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion,\u201d \u201cbroad authority,\u201d and \u201cwide latitude\u201d). According to the majority, any compelled speech condition will be upheld against a First Amendment challenge as long as that condition is \u201crelated to the crime of which the offender was convicted [or adjudicated guilty]\u201d and furthers some sentencing purpose. Majority at 755.\n\u00b645 The majority relies primarily on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Clark, 918 F.2d 843 (9th Cir. 1990), overruled on other grounds by United States v. Keys, 133 F.3d 1282 (9th Cir. 1988), for this deferential \u201crelated to the underlying crime\u201d test. Majority at 752-53. In Clark, the trial court imposed a probation condition requiring two officers convicted of perjury to publish apologies and acknowledge that they had lied and betrayed the trust and confidence of the people. 918 F.2d at 845. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, adopting a very forgiving rational-relationship test: \u201cThe test for validity of probation conditions, even where preferred rights are affected, is \u2018whether the limitations are primarily designed to affect the rehabilitation of the probationer or insure the protection of the public.\u2019\u201d Id. at 848 (quoting United States v. Consuelo-Gonzalez, 521 F.2d 259, 265 n.14 (9th Cir. 1975) (en banc)). Probation conditions satisfy the Clark test if \u201c \u2018the sentencing judge imposed the conditions for permissible purposes, and ... the conditions are reasonably related to the purposes.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting United States v. Terrigno, 838 F.2d 371, 374 (9th Cir. 1988)). The majority accurately cites the Clark test.\n\u00b646 But it is not the Supreme Court\u2019s test, it is not our court\u2019s Bahl test, and it cannot be the First Amendment\u2019s test. Under the majority\u2019s and Clark\u2019s test, the Alabama court could have ordered Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to write an apology to the state of Alabama rather than his \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail.\u201d The question for our court is not whether we like or hate that consequence as a policy matter. The question for us is only whether it is constitutional. Under the majority\u2019s restatement of the Clark test, it might be. But under the First Amendment, analogous Supreme Court decisions, and Bahl, it is not: before the State can compel a person\u2014even a juvenile offender\u2014to speak and endorse a viewpoint, the State must not only justify the condition with an important governmental need but must also narrowly tailor that condition so that it compels no more speech than necessary to meet that need. Martinez, 416 U.S. at 413; Bahl, 164 Wn.2d at 757.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b647 The juvenile court\u2019s forced apology condition fails under any First Amendment test other than the majority\u2019s highly deferential rational-relationship test borrowed from language in Clark. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s test in Martinez, the government cannot restrict the content of a prison inmate\u2019s speech in this context unless the restriction \u201cfurther [s] an important or substantial governmental interest\u201d and is narrowly tailored so that it infringes on \u201cno greater [speech] than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved.\u201d 416 U.S. at 413. The compelled confession and apology in this case fails that narrow-tailoring requirement. Under the test we articulated in Bahl, the condition must be \u201c \u2018reasonably necessary to accomplish the essential needs of the state and public order.\u2019\u201d Bahl, 164 Wn.2d at 757 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Riley, 121 Wn.2d at 37-38). The compelled confession and apology in this case fails that requirement also. In fact, under controlling Supreme Court precedent, compelled speeches and pledges are probably the worst ways to teach remorse or anything else: \u201cA person gets from a symbol the meaning he puts into it, and what is one man\u2019s comfort and inspiration is another\u2019s jest and scorn.\" Barnette, 319 U.S. at 632-33.\n\u00b648 I respectfully dissent.\nFairhurst and Gonz\u00e1lez, JJ., concur with Gordon McCloud, J.\nThe underlying case involved two alleged assaults against two different classmates, C.R. and E.O. The juvenile court acquitted K.H.-H. of the count against E.O. after video footage undermined E.O.\u2019s account of what had transpired. VTP (Aug. 14, 2013) at 143-44.\nAlthough forced apologies, especially ones that require an admission of guilt, may implicate a person\u2019s right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the federal constitution, K.H.-H. did not raise a Fifth Amendment challenge below or in his briefs to this court. See Wash. Court of Appeals oral argument, State v. K.H.-H., No. 45461-1-II (Feb. 27, 2015), at 2 min., 37 sec. (on file with court) (\u201cWe didn\u2019t actually really raise a Fifth Amendment issue although I do think there are Fifth Amendment questions here.\u2019\u2019).\nLater Supreme Court decisions certainly overruled the application of this rule to many prison situations. But they preserve its application to the single, limited situation at issue here, the convicted offender\u2019s own speech: \u201cMartinez [is] limited to regulations concerning outgoing [prisoner] correspondence.\u201d Abbott, 490 U.S. at 413.\nI agree with the majority that any reliance on freedom of association cases in the context of freedom of speech inquiries would be misplaced, see majority at 751, 752, because those cases describe a less exacting First Amendment analysis. See Riley, 121 Wn.2d at 37-38 (applying freedom of association analysis to restriction against associating with computer hackers and communicating on computer bulletin boards); Malone, 502 F.2d at 555 (banning participating with, belonging to, working for, or visiting certain establishments and organizations affiliated with the American Irish Republican movement); Birzon v. King, 469 F.2d 1241, 1241 (2d Cir. 1972) (prohibiting any association with persons having a criminal record). Notably, however, the decisions adopting those less protective tests addressed conditions restricting association, not conditions compelling association against the defendant\u2019s will.\nSee In re T.M., 2012-Ohio-3408, \u00b6 3, 2012 WL 3061851, 2012 Ohio App. LEXIS 2997, at *2-3 (affirming disposition order requiring the juvenile offender to write a 1,000-word essay on \u201c \u2018why racism is wrong\u2019 \u201d against First Amendment challenge). According to the court, an essay requirement does not implicate the First Amendment where the court merely chooses the topic of the essay that the juvenile is required to address. Id. \u00b6 5.",

        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b61 Sean O\u2019Dell was convicted of second degree rape of a child and given a standard range sentence of 95 months. O\u2019Dell committed this offense 10 days after his 18th birthday.\n\u00b62 O\u2019Dell raises two issues in this appeal: one challenge to his conviction and one challenge to his sentence. With respect to the conviction, he argues that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of reasonable belief that the victim \u2014 here, a 12-year-old girl \u2014 was at least 14 years old or less than 36 months younger than O\u2019Dell, based on the victim\u2019s declarations as to age. With respect to the sentence, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to consider O\u2019Dell\u2019s own relative youth as a basis to depart from the standard sentence range.\n\u00b63 For the reasons given below, we reject O\u2019Dell\u2019s challenge to his conviction but remand for a new sentencing hearing at which the trial court can consider whether youth diminished O\u2019Dell\u2019s culpability for his offense.\nFACTS\n\u00b64 About 10 days after his 18th birthday, O\u2019Dell had sex with 12-year-old A.N. According to A.N., the two met up on Sunday afternoon, along with a mutual friend, to drink wine and smoke cigars in the woods. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Jan. 16, 2013) at 254-59. A.N. testified that she, the friend, and O\u2019Dell made plans to meet up again later that night but that the friend did not join them as planned. Id. at 268-75. She testified that she and O\u2019Dell sat in the woods to wait for their friend and, after a few minutes of talking, O\u2019Dell forcibly raped her. Id. at 280-87. A.N. also testified that she told O\u2019Dell when they first met that she was 12 years old. Id. at 256-57.\n\u00b65 O\u2019Dell testified that he met A.N. at their mutual friend\u2019s house on Saturday night, where A.N. and others were drinking wine. VRP (Jan. 18, 2013) at 538. According to O\u2019Dell, he commented that A.N. looked too young to be drinking and she responded, \u201c \u2018I get that a lot.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 542. He testified that A.N. wanted to go swimming at the beach, that she left the party with O\u2019Dell to do this, and that the two had consensual sex on the walk to the beach. Id. at 544-48. He also testified that he first learned A.N.\u2019s age when A.N.\u2019s mother called him, the Monday after he had sex with A.N., and told him that her daughter was only 12. Id. at 572-74.\n\u00b66 The State charged O\u2019Dell with second degree rape of a child. With no objection from the State, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[i]t is ... a defense to the charge of Rape of a Child in the Second Degree that at the time of the acts the defendant reasonably believed that [A.N.] . . . was at least fourteen years of age, or was less than thirty-six months younger than the defendant based upon declarations as to age by [A.N.].\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 104. While deliberating, the jurors sent a question to the court regarding this instruction: \u201cAs to declarations as to age: Must it be verbal or can it be nonverbal?\u201d VRP (Nov. 9, 2012) at 533. Ultimately, the jury was unable to reach a verdict and the court declared a mistrial. Id. at 542-43.\n\u00b67 In the second trial, O\u2019Dell again requested a jury instruction on the affirmative defense that he reasonably believed A.N. was \u201cat least fourteen years of age, or was less then thirty-six months younger than the defendant, based upon declarations as to age by [A.N.].\u201d CP at 79. This time, the State objected. O\u2019Dell argued that A.N.\u2019s statement \u201cI get that a lot\u201d was an assertion that A.N. was older than she looked. VRP (Jan. 18, 2013) at 605-06; CP at 80-81. The trial court rejected that reasoning and denied the requested instruction. VRP (Jan. 18, 2013) at 607-08. The jury convicted O\u2019Dell as charged. CP at 62.\n\u00b68 At sentencing, the defense asked the court to impose an exceptional sentence below the standard range because \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct, or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, was significantly impaired by youth.\u201d CP at 37. The defense argued that when O\u2019Dell committed his offense, he \u201cwas still in high school, associating with school age persons\u201d and \u201cwas not some mid-twenties man hanging out at the local high school or trolling the internet for young people.\u201d Id. at 40. Counsel also pointed out that \u201c[h]ad the incident happened two weeks prior, and assuming the State could not convince the Court to prosecute [O\u2019Dell] as an adult, he would be facing 15-36 weeks in a well-guarded juvenile detention facility ... rather than 78-102 months in an adult prison.\u201d CP at 39. Finally, the defense quoted portions of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569-70, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005), which held that it is unconstitutional to impose the death penalty on a juvenile. CP at 38-39. Roper relied on research, by various medical and psychiatric associations, indicating that juveniles are more susceptible to negative influences and impulsive behavior and therefore less morally culpable for their crimes relative to adults. 543 U.S. at 570.\n\u00b69 The trial court acknowledged this argument but ruled that it could not consider age as a mitigating circumstance under the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in State v. Ha\u2019mim, 82 Wn. App. 139, 916 P.2d 971 (1996), aff\u2019d, 132 Wn.2d 834, 940 P.2d 633 (1997):\nThe other [mitigating factor] that is relied upon is (e), \u201cThe Defendant\u2019s capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct or to conform his or her conduct to the requirements of the law was significantly impaired. . . .\u201d\nSo I - I\u2019ve looked over, of course, this - this mitigating circumstance as well. And, really, I guess it comes down to the statement that Mr. O\u2019Dell made, and that is, \u201cI\u2019m just a boy who made a mistake.\u201d\nSo we\u2019re talking about his age. He\u2019s just a week past 18. Or he was not mature yet. Or whatever it is.\nBut then I looked up State v. Ha\u2019Mim, I think it is. H-A-[apostrophe]-M-I-M. It is 82 Wn. App. 139, 1996. And that it talks about [former] ROW 9.94A.390(1)(e) [(1996)], that factor I was saying, that capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness.\nAnd it specifically says that .a defendant\u2019s incapacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the criminal conduct cannot be based on the youthfulness of the Defendant...\" The particular judge in that case based it on that and was overturned.\nSo it is what it is.\nVRP (Mar. 6, 2013) at 73-75 (emphasis added) (fourth and seventh alterations in original).\n\u00b610 O\u2019Dell appealed his conviction and sentence. State v. O\u2019Dell, noted at 180 Wn. App. 1044, 2014 WL 1711548, at *1, 2014 Wash. App. LEXIS 1079, at *1. He argued that he was entitled to the jury instruction on the affirmative defense of reasonable belief and that the trial court should have considered his relative youth as a basis for an exceptional sentence below the standard range.\n\u00b611 The Court of Appeals held that the trial court properly rejected the affirmative defense instruction because there was no evidence that A.N. made any declarations as to her age. 2014 WL 1711548, at *2, 2014 Wash. App. LEXIS 1079, at *4-5. It also rejected O\u2019Dell\u2019s challenge to his sentence. 2014 WL 1711548, at *3, 2014 Wash. App. LEXIS 1079, at *7. First, the Court of Appeals concluded that this court\u2019s decision in Ha\u2019mim, 132 Wn.2d 834, barred the trial court from considering youth as a basis for an exceptional downward departure under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), chapter 9.94A RCW. 2014 WL 1711548, at *3, 2014 Wash. App. LEXIS 1079, at *7. This court\u2019s decision in Ha\u2019mim, like the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision that the trial court relied on at O\u2019Dell\u2019s sentencing hearing, held that a young adult offender\u2019s age is not, in and of itself, a mitigating circumstance justifying an exceptional lowered sentence. Ha\u2019mim, 132 Wn.2d at 846.\n\u00b612 The Court of Appeals also rejected O\u2019Dell\u2019s argument that Roper and recent research on adolescent brain development have abrogated Ha\u2019mim:\nFollowing the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roper v. Simmons, our legislature found that \u201cadolescent brains, and thus adolescent intellectual and emotional capabilities, differ significantly from those of mature adults. It is appropriate to take these differences into consideration when sentencing juveniles tried as adults,\u201d and amended RCW 9.94A-.540 prospectively. But this exception does not apply to O\u2019Dell, who was an adult and not a juvenile tried as an adult.\nO\u2019Dell, 2014 WL 1711548, at *3, 2014 Wash. App. LEXIS 1079, at *9 (footnotes omitted) (quoting Laws of 2005, ch. 437, \u00a7 1).\n\u00b613 We granted review. State v. O\u2019Dell, 181 Wn.2d 1020, 337 P.3d 327 (2014).\nANALYSIS\nI. The Trial Court Properly Declined To Instruct the Jury on the Affirmative Defense That the Defendant Reasonably Believed That the Victim Was at Least Fourteen Years of Age, or Was Less Than Thirty-Six Months Younger Than the Defendant, Based on Declarations by the Victim\n\u00b614 A defendant is entitled to a jury instruction that is supported by substantial evidence in the record. State v. Griffith, 91 Wn.2d 572, 574-75, 589 P.2d 799 (1979). In determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support a jury instruction on an affirmative defense, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant. State v. Ginn, 128 Wn. App. 872, 879, 117 P.3d 1155 (2005).\n\u00b615 In a prosecution for rape of a child in the second degree (an offense defined not by the perpetrator\u2019s use of force but instead by the victim\u2019s age), \u201cit is no defense that the perpetrator did not know the victim\u2019s age, or that the perpetrator believed the victim to be older.\u201d RCW 9A.44-.030(2), .076. But it is an affirmative defense, provable by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201cat the time of the offense the defendant reasonably believed the alleged victim to be [at least 14, or less than 36 months younger than the defendant] based upon declarations as to age by the alleged victim.\u201d RCW 9A.44.030(2), (3)(b).\n\u00b616 O\u2019Dell contends that A.N. made a declaration as to her age when, in response to his comment that she appeared too young to be drinking, she responded, \u201c 1 get that a lot.\u2019 \u201d VRP (Jan. 18, 2013) at 542.\n\u00b617 The trial court properly rejected this argument. The trial court noted in its ruling that A.N.\u2019s comment \u201cdoesn\u2019t say anything . . . about any specific ages.\u201d Id. at 608. This determination was correct. We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that O\u2019Dell was not entitled to his requested affirmative defense instruction.\nII. The Trial Court Erred in Failing To Consider Youth as a Possible Mitigating Factor Justifying an Exceptional Sentence\n\u00b618 Whether a particular factor can justify an exceptional sentence is a question of law, which we review de novo. Ha\u2019mim, 132 Wn.2d at 840.\n\u00b619 The question presented in this case is the same question this court considered in Ha\u2019mim: whether a defendant\u2019s youth can justify an exceptional sentence below the standard range when the defendant was over 18 when he or she committed the offense. Thus, the parties to this case agree that Ha\u2019mim is the relevant controlling authority.\n\u00b620 But the parties disagree about what Ha\u2019mim held. O\u2019Dell contends that Ha\u2019mim absolutely bars a sentencing court from considering \u201cyouth and its attributes as mitigating factors.\u201d Suppl. Br. of Pet\u2019r at 6. And he argues that we should overturn Ha\u2019mim because this prohibition is incorrect and harmful. Id. The State interprets Ha\u2019mim differently; it argues that age \u201cmay be relevant,\u201d under Ha\u2019mim, \u201cfor the statutory mitigating factor that the defendant\u2019s capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct, or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, was significantly impaired.\u201d Suppl. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 10. But it contends that a defendant must provide some evidence that youth in fact impaired his capacities, since youth does not per se automatically reduce an adult offender\u2019s culpability. Id.\n\u00b621 For the reasons given below, we agree with much of the State\u2019s interpretation of Ha\u2019mim. That decision did not bar trial courts from considering a defendant\u2019s youth at sentencing; it held only that the trial court may not impose an exceptional sentence automatically on the basis of youth, absent any evidence that youth in fact diminished a defendant\u2019s culpability. But we also conclude that the trial court in this case improperly interpreted Ha\u2019mim just as O\u2019Dell does: to bar any consideration of the defendant\u2019s youth at sentencing. Thus, we find that the trial court did not meaningfully consider youth as a possible mitigating factor in this case, and we remand for a new sentencing hearing.\nYouth satisfies the two-part test this court applies to determine whether a factor legally supports a departure from the standard sentence range\n\u00b622 To determine whether a factor legally supports departure from the standard sentence range, we apply a two-part test. Ha\u2019mim, 132 Wn.2d at 840. First, a factor cannot support the imposition of an exceptional sentence if the legislature necessarily considered that factor when it established the standard sentence range. Id. (citing State v. Alexander, 125 Wn.2d 717, 725, 888 P.2d 1169 (1995)). Second, in order to justify an exceptional sentence, a factor must be \u201csufficiently substantial and compelling to distinguish the crime in question from others in the same category.\u201d Id.\n1. Youth is not a factor that the legislature necessarily considered when it established the standard sentence ranges for offenders over the age of 18\n\u00b623 Although we addressed youth as a basis for an exceptional sentence in Ha\u2019mim, that case discussed only the second part of the test: whether age is a factor sufficiently substantial and compelling to distinguish a defendant\u2019s crime from others in the same category. Id. at 845-47. Thus, we have never considered whether the legislature necessarily considered youth when it established the standard range sentences applicable under the SRA. The State contends that the legislature \u201cexplicitly considered ... age\u201d when it made the SRA applicable to felony offenders 18 and older. Suppl. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 9 (citing RCW 9.94A.030(34)). This argument fails for two reasons.\n\u00b624 First, this court has held that when the legislature defines (and therefore punishes) an offense according to the victim\u2019s age, this does not necessarily prevent a sentencing court from relying on the victim\u2019s particular age to impose an exceptional sentence. In State v. Fisher, 108 Wn.2d 419, 423-24, 739 P.2d 683 (1987), for example, this court considered whether the victim\u2019s \u201cparticular vulnerability due to extreme youth\u201d could justify an exceptional sentence above the range when the fact of the victim\u2019s youth \u2014 specifically, the fact that the victim was less than 14 years old \u2014 was already an element of the defendant\u2019s crime. The Fisher court held that it could, concluding that \u201c[w]hile the Legislature might have reasoned that victims less than 14 years old were more vulnerable in general than those 14 or older, it could not have considered the particular vulnerabilities of specific individuals.\u201d Id. at 424 (emphasis added).\n\u00b625 The same logic applies in this case. The legislature has determined that all defendants 18 and over are, in general, equally culpable for equivalent crimes. But it could not have considered the particular vulnerabilities \u2014 for example, impulsivity, poor judgment, and susceptibility to outside influences \u2014 of specific individuals. The trial court is in the best position to consider those factors.\n\u00b626 Second, when the legislature enacted RCW 9.94A-.030(34) \u2014 defining an \u201coffender\u201d subject to the SRA as \u201ca person who has committed a felony established by state law and is eighteen years of age or older . . .\u201d \u2014 it did not have the benefit of the data underlying the decisions in Roper, Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 176 L. Ed. 2d 825 (2010), and Miller v. Alabama, _U.S. _, 132 S. Ct. 2455, 183 L. Ed. 2d 407 (2012), since the SRA\u2019s definition of an \u201coffender\u201d predates Roper by roughly 25 years. Laws op 1981, ch. 137, \u00a7 3(11). Thus, when the legislature enacted RCW 9.94A.030(34), it did not have the benefit of psychological and neurological studies showing that the \u201c \u2018parts of the brain involved in behavior control\u2019 \u201d continue to develop well into a person\u2019s 20s.\n\u00b627 These studies reveal fundamental differences between adolescent and mature brains in the areas of risk and consequence assessment, impulse control, tendency toward antisocial behaviors, and susceptibility to peer pressure. As amici Washington Defender Association et al. put it, \u201c[ujntil full neurological maturity, young people in general have less ability to control their emotions, clearly identify consequences, and make reasoned decisions than they will when they enter their late twenties and beyond.\u201d Br. of Amici Curiae in Supp. of Appellant at 9-10. In Miller, Roper, and Graham, the Court recognized that these neurological differences make young offenders, in general, less culpable for their crimes: \u201c[T]he distinctive attributes of youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences[;] . . . [bjecause \u2018[t]he heart of the retribution rationale\u2019 relates to an offender\u2019s blameworthiness, \u2018the case for retribution is not as strong with a minor as with an adult.\u2019 \u201d Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2465 (internal quotation marks omitted) (fifth alteration in original) (quoting Graham, 560 U.S. at 71 and citing Roper, 543 U.S. at 571).\n\u00b628 It is precisely these differences that might justify a trial court\u2019s finding that youth diminished a defendant\u2019s culpability, and there was no way for our legislature to consider these differences when it made the SRA sentencing ranges applicable to all offenders over 18 years of age. Thus, we decline to hold that the legislature necessarily considered the relationship between age and culpability when it made the SRA applicable to all defendants 18 and older.\n2. Scientific advances in the study of adolescent brain development, unavailable to the Ha\u2019mim court, show that youth can significantly mitigate culpability\n\u00b629 This court recognized in Ha\u2019mim that youth might be relevant to one of the mitigating factors listed in current RCW 9.94A.535: an impairment of the defendant\u2019s \u201ccapacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct or to conform his or her conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d 132 Wn.2d at 846 (citing former RCW 9.94A.390(l)(e) (1996)). But the Ha\u2019mim court then went on to conclude that the record before it contained \u201cno evidence ... that the Defendant\u2019s capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct or to conform it to the requirements of the law were in any way impaired.\u201d Id.\n\u00b630 In reaching that conclusion, this court embraced broad reasoning from the Court of Appeals regarding the relationship between youth and culpability:\nIn the context of [former] RCW 9.94A.390(l)(e), the Court of Appeals has rejected a 17-year-old\u2019s argument that his youth should have been considered at sentencing. State v. Scott, 72 Wn. App. 207, 218-19, 866 P.2d 1258 (1993), aff\u2019d, [State v.] Ritchie, 126 Wn.2d 388, 894 P.2d 1308 (1995). The Scott opinion states:\nScott asserts that his youth, 17 years old at the time of the crime, limited his \u201ccapacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law,\u201d [former] RCW 9.94A.390(l)(e), and thus, the exceptional sentence [above the standard range] was improper. This argument borders on the absurd.\nGranted, teenagers are more impulsive than adults and lack mature judgment. However, Scott\u2019s conduct cannot seriously be blamed on his \u201clack of judgment\u201d, as he contends. Premeditated murder is not a common teenage vice.\nScott, 72 Wn. App. at 218-19 (footnote omitted).\nId. at 846-47 (first emphasis added) (fourth alteration in original).\n\u00b631 Having embraced this reasoning \u2014 that it is \u201cabsurd\u201d to believe that youth could mitigate culpability \u2014 this court went on to explain that youth alone could not be a nonstatutory mitigating factor under the SRA because \u201c[t]he age of the defendant does not relate to the crime or the previous record of the defendant.\u201d Id. at 847 (emphasis added).\n\u00b632 When our court made that sweeping conclusion, it did not have the benefit of the studies underlying Miller, Roper, and Graham \u2014 studies that establish a clear connection between youth and decreased moral culpability for criminal conduct. And as the United States Supreme Court recognized in Roper, this connection may persist well past an individual\u2019s 18th birthday: \u201cThe qualities that distinguish juveniles from adults do not disappear when an individual turns 18 [just as] some under 18 have already attained a level of maturity some adults will never reach.\u201d 543 U.S. at 574; see also supra note 5.\n\u00b633 Today, we do have the benefit of those advances in the scientific literature. Thus, we now know that age may well mitigate a defendant\u2019s culpability, even if that defendant is over the age of 18. It remains true that age is not a per se mitigating factor automatically entitling every youthful defendant to an exceptional sentence. In this respect, we adhere to our holding in Ha\u2019mim, 132 Wn.2d at 847. But, in light of what we know today about adolescents\u2019 cognitive and emotional development, we conclude that youth may, in fact, \u201c \u2018relate to [a defendant\u2019s] crime,\u2019 \u201d id. (quoting RCW 9.94A-.340); that it is far more likely to diminish a defendant\u2019s culpability than this court implied in Ha\u2019mim; and that youth can, therefore, amount to a substantial and compelling factor, in particular cases, justifying a sentence below the standard range.\n\u00b634 For these reasons, a trial court must be allowed to consider youth as a mitigating factor when imposing a sentence on an offender like O\u2019Dell, who committed his offense just a few days after he turned 18. To the extent that this court\u2019s reasoning in Ha\u2019mim is inconsistent, we disavow that reasoning.\nIII. The Trial Court Failed To Consider Whether Youth Diminished O\u2019Dell\u2019s Capacity To Appreciate the Wrongfulness of His Conduct or To Conform That Conduct to the Requirements of the Law\n\u00b635 In this case, the trial court did not meaningfully consider youth as a possible mitigating circumstance. As detailed above, the trial court clearly believed that the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in Ha\u2019mim absolutely prohibited it from considering whether youth diminished O\u2019Dell\u2019s capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or conform that conduct to the requirements of the law. See VRP (Mar. 6, 2013) at 74-75 (\u201c \u2018a defendant\u2019s incapacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the criminal conduct cannot be based on the youthfulness of the Defendant...\u2019\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\u00b636 This failure to exercise discretion is itself an abuse of discretion subject to reversal. State v. Grayson, 154 Wn.2d 333, 342, 111 P.3d 1183 (2005) (the trial court\u2019s failure to consider an exceptional sentence authorized by-statute is reversible error). We therefore remand for a new sentencing hearing. At that hearing the trial court will consider, in light of this opinion, whether youth diminished O\u2019Dell\u2019s culpability.\n\u00b637 Finally, we note that despite the scientific and technical nature of the studies underlying the Roper, Graham, and Miller decisions, a defendant need not present expert testimony to establish that youth diminished his capacities for purposes of sentencing. As in a juvenile court decline hearing, where the court considers whether a juvenile\u2019s \u201csophistication and maturity\u201d support his or her prosecution as an adult, lay testimony may be sufficient. See, e.g., State v. M.A., 106 Wn. App. 493, 501 n.14, 23 P.3d 508 (2001) (affirming decline of juvenile jurisdiction in part because \u201c \u2018[b]y all accounts, [M.A.] is physically very mature [and] [M.A.] has spent much of his youth with older adults\u2019 \u201d (second and fourth alterations in original)); State v. Toomey, 38 Wn. App. 831, 835, 690 P2d 1175 (1984) (finding juvenile sufficiently \u201csophisticat[ed]\u201d to be prosecuted as an adult because \u201c[w]hether by choice or not, Toomey had been on her own for over a year. She knew how to operate in her environment, and she readily involved herself in adult situations\u201d).\n\u00b638 In this case, the defense offered just such lay testimony that a trial court should consider in evaluating whether youth diminished a defendant\u2019s culpability. E.g., VRP (Mar. 6, 2013) at 62-63 (mother testifying that after O\u2019Dell committed his offense, \u201c[a]s I was cleaning a pack from his room so that we could move, I was struck by the contents of his room. In his room I found his Lego collection, a poster of Daffy Duck on Harley-Davidson, the stuffed kitty that had been on his bed since he was born .... [H]e\u2019s only a kid. He likes to play video games, and he likes to go hiking, and he likes to play music and tease his sisters. He rolls his eyes when he\u2019s forced on a family outing . . see also id. at 42 (friend and former babysitter of the defendant testifying that he \u201chas lots of growing up to do\u201d), 44 (friend testifying that O\u2019Dell \u201cthinks and ... talks and ... acts like I did when I was 18-years old. . . . [H]e is still forming his own identity ... [and needs a chance to] become a corrected and productive member of society\u201d), 48 (family\u2019s pastor testifying that \u201c[w]hen I met with [O\u2019Dell] ... just a couple weeks ago, I saw the same immature kid who wanted to be with good people and do good things\u201d), 51 (family friend testifying that \u201c[s]tudies show that boys do not mature as quickly as girls do. This remains true for Sean O\u2019Dell .... Even though his birth date says he was 18, mentally, he was not\u201d), 56 (cousin testifying that in \u201cthe time I\u2019ve spent with [O\u2019Dell] ... I think the most grown-up thing I\u2019ve ever done with him was play a video game .... He\u2019s just a kid. He\u2019s a young, young kid. He\u2019s a boy.\u201d), 59 (sister testifying that \u201c[e]motionally, [0\u2019Dell]\u2019s still just a kid who likes hanging out, video games and family nights at the movies\u201d).\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b639 In Ha\u2019mim, 132 Wn.2d at 847, this court held that a defendant\u2019s age, alone, does not automatically support an exceptional sentence below the standard range applicable to an adult felony offender. Ha\u2019mim contains reasoning that some, including the trial court in this instance, have understood as absolutely barring any exceptional downward departure sentence below the range on the basis of youth. That reasoning has been thoroughly undermined by subsequent scientific developments. Accordingly, we disavow it. We hold that a defendant\u2019s youthfulness can support an exceptional sentence below the standard range applicable to an adult felony defendant, and that the sentencing court must exercise its discretion to decide when that is.\n\u00b640 We affirm the Court of Appeals as to O\u2019Dell\u2019s conviction, but we reverse the Court of Appeals as to O\u2019Dell\u2019s sentence and remand for a new sentencing hearing in accordance with this opinion.\nMadsen, C.J., and Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nSee Br. of Appellant at 9-10 (\u201cThe Washington State Supreme Court has concluded \u2018the age of the defendant does not relate to the crime or the previous record of the defendant.\u2019 . . . Ha\u2019mim, 132 Wn.2d [at] 847. . . . But since Ha\u2019mim was decided, courts have recognized youth does alter the nature of the crime and thus relates directly to the crime.\u201d).\nSuppl. Br. of Pet\u2019r at 19 (\u201cThe plain language [of RCW 9.94A.030(2)] requires nothing more than a statement, an assertion of fact verbal or otherwise, relating to age. O\u2019Dell presented such evidence. He testified he was drinking with two other adolescents .... He commented to [A.N.] \u2018you look too young to be drinking.\u2019 She responded T get that a lot.\u2019 That is a statement by [A.N.] regarding her age, it is a factual assertion that she was older than she appeared. The foundation for the defense was met.\u201d (citations omitted)).\nThe rationale for this part of the test is that \u201c \u2018while factors which truly distinguish the crime from others of the same category may justify an exception, those which are inherent in that class of crimes\u2019 \u201d cannot be the basis for such a distinction. Alexander, 125 Wn.2d at 725 (quoting David Boerner, Sentencing in Washington \u00a7 9.6, at 9-13 (1985)). Thus, for example, an offender\u2019s criminal history cannot justify an exceptional sentence \u201csince criminal history is one of the two components (the other being the seriousness of the offense) used to compute the presumptive range.\u201d State v.

Ct. 2455.\nAs the dissent correctly notes, our legislature addressed the relationship between youth and culpability in 2005, when \u2014 in response to \u201c \u2018emerging research on brain development\u2019 \u201d \u2014 it eliminated mandatory minimum sentences for juveniles tried as adults. Dissent at 700 (quoting Laws of 2005, ch. 437, \u00a7 1). The dissent would hold that our legislature therefore \u201cnecessarily considered an offender\u2019s age when it determined that the adult sentencing guidelines attach when the offender is 18 years old.\u201d Id. But the question before us is not whether the adult sentencing guidelines apply to an 18-year-old offender \u2014 everyone agrees that they do. The question is whether the legislature necessarily considered emerging research on adolescent brain development (the Roper research) when it established the standard range sentences applicable to adult offenders. See Nordby, 106 Wn.2d at 518 n.4 (\u201c[flor example, the sentencing judge may not list the offender\u2019s criminal history as a reason to justify an exceptional sentence since criminal history is one of the two components (the other being the seriousness of the offense) used to compute the presumptive range\u201d).\nFor all the reasons given above, we hold that the answer is no: the legislature did not necessarily consider the Roper research when it established the standard range sentences applicable to offenders 18 and over. To be sure, it considered that research in 2005 and amended a juvenile sentencing law in response. But the dissent reads far too much into the amendment, interpreting it as a bar to any youth-related exceptional sentencing under the SRA. See dissent at 700 (arguing that the defendant\u2019s relative youth can never justify an exceptional sentence because \u201cthe legislature reviewed the relevant literature and had the opportunity to reevaluate the age at which the adult sentencing guidelines attach\u201d). This is a radical departure from our case law on exceptional sentencing.\nFinally, it is not entirely clear what the dissent thinks the trial court may consider when sentencing a relatively young adult offender. Under the first prong of our test for valid exceptional sentencing factors, the dissent concludes that neither age nor the Roper research can play any role at all in the court\u2019s decision to depart from the standard range. The dissent explains that the legislature \u201cnecessarily considered\u201d both age and \u201cthe relevant literature\u201d on adolescent brain development before deciding, in 2005, to amend only the sentencing laws applicable to juveniles tried as adults (and not those applicable to offenders 18 and over). Id. But later the dissent makes a different and much narrower argument: that \u201cage alone\u201d cannot justify an exceptional sentence. Id. at 701 (emphasis added). This rule is consistent with our decision; we remand so that the trial court may consider O\u2019Dell\u2019s age and testimony, by numerous witnesses, about his general maturity level. In light of our fundamental agreement with the dissent on this point, we think that the dissent simply views the evidence differently than we do \u2014 it concludes, for example, that testimony about O\u2019Dell\u2019s hobbies is not probative of his maturity level. Id. at 703. But as the dissent acknowledges, \u201cthe trial court [is] in the best place to make such a determination.\u201d Id. at 704. And in this case, the trial court did not believe it had any discretion to do so. See supra p. 686.\nSee Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2464-65 (\u201cthose findings \u2014 of transient rashness, proclivity for risk, and inability to assess consequences \u2014 ... lessen! ] a child\u2019s \u2018moral culpability1 \u201d (quoting Graham, 560 U.S. at 67-68)); see also supra notes 5-10.\nThe dissent contends that the trial court considered all of the testimony \u201cfrom various acquaintances, family members, and O\u2019Dell himself regarding his youthfulness\u201d and rejected it as conclusory because \u201c \u2018[jlust calling somebody a \u201cboy\u201d doesn\u2019t make them a \u201cboy.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Dissent at 702-03 (alteration in original) (quoting VRP (Mar. 6, 2013) at 74). We disagree with this reading of the record. As noted above, when the trial court stated that \u201c[j]ust calling somebody a \u2018boy\u2019 doesn\u2019t make them a \u2018boy,\u2019 \u201d it was referring specifically to \u201cthe statement that Mr. O\u2019Dell made, and that is, \u2018I\u2019m just a boy who made a mistake.\u2019 VRP (Mar. 6, 2013) at 74. The trial court did not address the statements by numerous other witnesses regarding O\u2019Dell\u2019s maturity level.\nThe dissent would hold that none of this testimony suffices to show that \u201cage actually diminished [O\u2019Dell\u2019s] capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or impaired his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d Dissent at 703. We decline to decide that question as a matter of law. Such factual and credibility determinations should be made by the trial court.",

At sentencing, O\u2019Dell sought an exceptional sentence below the standard range because he committed the rape 10 days past his 18th birthday. The trial court denied O\u2019Dell\u2019s request and imposed a standard range sentence. We must decide whether a defendant\u2019s age alone may form the basis for an exceptional sentence. I would adhere to our precedent in State v. Ha\u2019mim, 132 Wn.2d 834, 846, 940 P.2d 633 (1997), that held age is not a substantial and compelling basis to grant an exceptional sentence absent evidence that age actually affected the defendant\u2019s capacities. Because there is no such evidence here, I respectfully dissent.\nA. O\u2019Dell is not entitled to an exceptional sentence below the standard range based on his age alone\n\u00b642 Generally, a trial court may impose a sentence outside the standard range only if there are substantial and compelling reasons justifying the exceptional sentence. See former ROW 9.94A.535 (2011). We use a two-part test to determine whether a factor may legally support a departure from the standard sentence range. State v. Law, 154 Wn.2d 85, 95, 110 P.3d 717 (2005). \u201c \u00a3[F]irst, a trial court may not base an exceptional sentence on factors necessarily considered by the Legislature in establishing the standard sentence range.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Ha\u2019mim, 132 Wn.2d at 840). Second, the \u201c \u2018mitigating factor must be sufficiently substantial and compelling to distinguish the crime in question from others in the same category.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Ha\u2019mim, 132 Wn.2d at 840).\n\u00b643 Beginning with the first inquiry, I agree with the State that the legislature necessarily considered an offender\u2019s age when it determined that the adult sentencing guidelines attach when the offender is 18 years old. See former RCW 9.94A.030(34) (2011). The majority finds fault in this conclusion because the legislature did not have the access to recent scientific literature addressing the psychological and neurological distinctions between juveniles and adults. See majority at 691-92. To the contrary, the legislature reviewed the relevant literature and had the opportunity to reevaluate the age at which the adult sentencing guidelines attach. The legislature found such research pertinent only to juveniles tried as adults. See Laws of 2005, ch. 437, \u00a7 1 (\u201cThe legislature finds that emerging research on brain development indicates that adolescent brains . . . differ significantly from those of mature adults. It is appropriate to take these differences into consideration when sentencing juveniles tried as adults.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\u00b644 Thus, the legislature has considered the offender\u2019s age on several occasions in determining the standard range sentence. The establishment of penalties for criminal offenses is a legislative function, \u201c \u2018and the power of the legislature in that respect is plenary and subject only to constitutional provisions.\u2019 \u201d State v. Varga, 151 Wn.2d 179, 193, 86 P.3d 139 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Thorne, 129 Wn.2d 736, 767, 921 P.2d 514 (1996)). We should not supplant the legislature\u2019s judgment in this matter with our own.\n\u00b645 Turning to the second prong, a defendant\u2019s age alone is not a sufficiently substantial or compelling factor to distinguish the crime in question from others in the same category. I agree with the majority and the United States Supreme Court that \u201c \u00a3[t]he qualities that distinguish juveniles from adults do not disappear when an individual turns 18.\u2019 \u201d Majority at 695 (alteration in original) (quoting Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 574, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005)). But as both recognize, \u201c \u2018some under 18 have already attained a level of maturity some adults will never reach.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Roper, 543 U.S. at 574). This leads me to believe that age is not a reliable indicator of an individual\u2019s mental and emotional faculties for purposes of sentencing and is not alone sufficient to justify an exceptional sentence. The majority even acknowledges that a defendant\u2019s age does not automatically result in an exceptional sentence, only in \u201cparticular cases.\u201d Id. at 696. This reasoning implicitly recognizes the existence of a factor that distinguishes those young adults that have the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of their conduct and those that do not. A defendant\u2019s age alone cannot form the basis for an exceptional sentence.\n\u00b646 This is not to say that age is irrelevant. Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), chapter 9.94A RCW, a sentencing court may impose an exceptional sentence below the standard range if a defendant establishes that his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was significantly impaired. Former RCW 9.94A.535(l)(e) (2011). Indeed, Ha\u2019mim itself recognized that age is relevant to this determination. 132 Wn.2d at 846. But a defendant may not rely on age alone. Rather, there must be evidence that his age actually diminished his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions or impaired his ability to control his conduct. Here, as in Ha\u2019mim, there is no such evidence.\nB. The trial court did not fail to exercise its discretion\n\u00b647 Under the SRA, a defendant generally may not appeal a standard range sentence. RCW 9.94A.585(1). However, a defendant may appeal such a sentence if the trial court refused to exercise its discretion. State v. Garcia-Martinez, 88 Wn. App. 322, 330, 944 P.2d 1104 (1997). \u201cA court refuses to exercise its discretion if it refuses categorically to impose an exceptional sentence below the standard range under any circumstances; i.e., it takes the position that it will never impose a sentence below the standard range.\u201d Id.\n\u00b648 Contrary to the majority\u2019s view, when read in context, the record reveals that the trial court did not categorically refuse to consider an exceptional sentence. In deciding whether O\u2019Dell deserved an exceptional sentence under former RCW 9.94A.535(l)(e), the trial court heard testimony from various acquaintances, family members, and O\u2019Dell himself regarding his youthfulness. The trial court considered this testimony and rejected it as conclusory, stating that \u201c[j]ust calling somebody a hoy\u2019 doesn\u2019t make them a \u2018boy.\u2019 \u201d Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Mar. 6, 2013) at 74.\n\u00b649 Other than these statements, O\u2019Dell presented no evidence that his age actually diminished his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or impaired his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. The majority cites to testimony that O\u2019Dell kept childish memorabilia in his room, such as a Lego collection, and that he enjoyed playing video games. Majority at 697; see also VRP (Mar. 6, 2013) at 56, 59-60, 63. But whether an individual constructs Legos or enjoys video games tells us little about whether he has the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. Indeed, these are activities enjoyed by many adults. See Thane Grauel, Lego builds adult fan base, USA Today (Nov. 28, 2014), http://www.usatoday .com/story/news/nation/2014/11/28/lego-builds-adult-fan -base/19637025/; Susanna Kim, Seattle Guy\u2019s Lego Man Cave Contains About 250,000 Pieces and a Bar, ABC News (May 5, 2015), http://abcnews.go.com/US/seattle-mans-lego-man-cave -250000-pieces-bar/story?id=30818092 see also Entm\u2019t Software Ass\u2019n, Essential Facts about the Computer and Video Game Industry 3 (2015), http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads /2015/04/ESAEssential-Facts-2015.pdf (finding that the average video game player is 35 years old and only 26 percent of video game players are under the age of 18 years old). These activities in and of themselves are not particularly reflective of O\u2019Dell\u2019s general culpability. In short, they are neither substantial nor compelling to justify an exceptional sentence.\n\u00b650 Contrary to establishing diminished culpability, the evidence from trial revealed that O\u2019Dell actually possessed the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions. For example, during direct examination, O\u2019Dell testified that he was worried when he learned A.N. was 12 years old because he knew that his conduct \u201ccouldn\u2019t be legal.\u201d VRP (Jan. 18, 2013) at 550. Moreover, it cannot be said that O\u2019Dell succumbed to peer pressure because of his youth. The record does not reveal any negative influences from peer pressure. In fact, O\u2019Dell was the most sophisticated and mature person involved during the weekend that the rape occurred. A.N. was 12 years old and in the sixth grade, and their mutual friend was 13. By contrast, O\u2019Dell was 18 and a senior in high school. In this context, O\u2019Dell\u2019s claim that he was \u201cjust a boy\u201d is suspect, VRP (Mar. 6,2013) at 67, and the trial court was in the best place to make such a determination.\n\u00b651 Because O\u2019Dell presented no other evidence regarding his intellectual and emotional capabilities, the trial court recognized that all that was left was O\u2019Dell\u2019s chronological age. Id. at 74 (\u201cSo we\u2019re talking about his age. He\u2019s just a week past 18.\u201d). Properly relying on Ha\u2019mim, the trial court held that youth alone was not sufficient to warrant an exceptional sentence and concluded that there were \u201cno mitigating factors here.\u201d Id. at 74, 76. The trial court considered the facts and concluded there was no basis for an exceptional sentence. This was a proper exercise of discretion that O\u2019Dell may not appeal. See former ROW 9.94A.585(1).\n\u00b652 As we held in Ha\u2019mim, age alone may not form the basis for an exceptional sentence below the standard range absent evidence that age affected the defendant\u2019s capacities. Because there is no such evidence here, I would affirm the Court of Appeals.\nJohnson, Owens, and Stephens, JJ., concur with Fairhurst, J.\nvI agree with the majority on the jury instruction issue.\nFor this reason, I also reject the majority\u2019s reliance on State v. Fisher, 108 Wn.2d 419, 423-24, 739 P.2d 683 (1987). See majority at 691. In Fisher, we reasoned that the legislature could not have possibly considered the particular vulnerabilities of specific victims. Here, the legislature has reviewed the relevant scientific literature and understands the attendant properties that accompany youth. However, the legislature has expressly limited the effect of such research to juveniles tried as adults.\nThe legislature also could have amended the age where the adult sentencing guidelines attach after our decision in Ha\u2019mim but did not.\nI find this particularly true toward the \u201cmargins between adolescence and adulthood\u201d because \u201cthe relevant differences between \u2018adults\u2019 and \u2018juveniles\u2019 appear to be a matter of degree, rather than of kind.\u201d Roper, 543 U.S. at 600 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting).\nSee Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Mar. 6, 2013) at 42 (\u201cHe\u2019s still a kid.\u201d), 45 (\u201cHe\u2019s a kid. He don\u2019t know any better.\u201d), 48 (\u201cWhen I met with him at that time just a couple weeks ago, I saw the same immature kid who wanted to be with good people and do good things.\u201d), 50 (\u201cI know that Sean is a good boy.\u201d), 51 (\u201cHe was a young boy who made an honest mistake, like many boys his age have done. Even though his birth date says he was 18, mentally, he was not.\u201d), 53 (\u201cHe\u2019s just a boy.... He is a kind boy and he wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone.\u201d), 56 (\u201cHe\u2019s just a kid. He\u2019s a young, young kid. He\u2019s a boy. He made a stupid mistake, yes.\u201d). During allocution, O\u2019Dell stated, \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m a boy who made a mistake.\u201d Id. at 67.\nThe majority interprets this statement to mean that the trial court considered only O\u2019Dell\u2019s statement and not comments from other witnesses. Majority at 696 n.12. But the court referenced O\u2019Dell\u2019s statement that he was \u201cjust a boy\u201d because it reflected the entirety of the comments made by O\u2019Dell\u2019s relatives and friends. See supra note 18. This becomes clear when the court\u2019s statement is read in context. The court began by explaining that it had reviewed the mitigating circumstance, and then it noted that the entirety of the assertions made by defense witnesses could be summarized by O\u2019Dell\u2019s statement. VRP (Mar. 6,2013) at 74 (\u201cSo I - I\u2019ve looked over, of course, this - this mitigating circumstance as well. And, really, I guess it comes down to the statement that Mr. O\u2019Dell made, and that is, Tm just a boy who made a mistake.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added)). Any doubt as to whether the trial court was addressing only O\u2019Dell\u2019s statement or the sentencing statements as a whole is resolved when the court then referenced a comment made by O\u2019Dell\u2019s mother that no one would ever refer to O\u2019Dell as \u201c \u2018Mister.\u2019 \u201d Compare id. at 63 (O\u2019Dell\u2019s mother noting that \u201c[njobody would have called [O\u2019Dell] \u2018Mister* \u201d), with id. at 74 (Trial court advising that \u201c[j]ust calling somebody a \u2018boy\u2019 doesn\u2019t make them a \u2018boy.\u2019 And - and the fact that I use \u2018Mr. O\u2019Dell\u2019 in here is a form of respect. It\u2019s a form of respect for whatever person that comes before me, whatever their age. I have called 7-year-olds \u2018mister\u2019 \u201d). The trial court therefore not only considered all of the sentencing testimony, but went as far as to respond to specific comments made by O\u2019Dell\u2019s family.\nI also note that rape \u201c \u2018is not a common teenage vice\u2019 \u201d that can be blamed on a lack of judgment. Ha\u2019mim, 132 Wn.2d at 847 (quoting State v. Scott, 72 Wn. App. 207, 219, 866 P.2d 1258 (1993)). For this reason, the trial court likely rejected testimony from O\u2019Dell\u2019s friends and family that characterized his conduct as an \u201chonest mistake.\u201d VRP (Mar. 6,2013) at 51; see also id. at 57 (\u201cLike I said, he made a stupid mistake.\u201d), 67 (\u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m a boy who made a mistake\u201d). Such assertions appear flippant in the face of testimony from A.N. that O\u2019Dell held her down, pulled off her pants and undergarments, and forcibly raped her while she told him to stop. See VRP (Jan. 16, 2013) at 281-84. And while force is not an element of child rape, the trial court stated at sentencing that \u201c[A.N.] was traumatized. And that trauma showed up on Monday morning. ... So I believe [A.N.], and I trust in the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d VRP (Mar. 6, 2013) at 75. A.N.\u2019s family also testified as to the trauma inflicted on her. See id. at 23 (\u201c[O\u2019Dell] has made my granddaughter go through hell since that night. Sometimes she\u2019s okay, and then at other times she will revert to the age of 5 or 6.\u201d), 25 (\u201cThe nightmares. She wakes up at night crying. Her mother finds her in the closet hiding under covers, under her bed.\u201d), 26 (\u201cAnd, eventually, [A.N.] had to be pulled out of school and [her mother] is now homeschooling her.\u201d), 31 (\u201cTo watch her start to become an independent young girl to a child that needs to be comforted and laid with each night, holding my hand in the car when we leave home, or needing to leave where we have gone because it\u2019s just too crowded and overwhelming for her to be there\u201d).",

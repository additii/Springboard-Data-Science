        "text": "Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\n\u00b61 This case presents two questions: (1) whether Chad Duncan can challenge the legal financial obligations (LFOs) imposed by the trial court for the first time on appeal and (2) whether the police properly searched his car for a gun after a drive-by shooting. We answer yes to both questions, affirm Duncan\u2019s conviction, and remand for resentencing with proper consideration of his ability to pay LFOs.\nFacts\n\u00b62 A little after midnight in Yakima one summer night in 2009, someone in a car shot into a home, grazing Kyle Mullins\u2019 head. Other people in the home called 911 for medical assistance and to report the shooting. Callers described the car as white and possibly a Subaru or Impala. Officers were dispatched and stopped Duncan\u2019s white Ford Taurus. Officers removed Duncan and his two passengers from the car at gunpoint, ordered them to the ground, handcuffed them, and put them in separate police cars. Without a warrant, officers opened the doors and found shell casings on the floor and a gun between the front passenger seat and the door. One officer removed the gun and placed it into an evidence bag in his own patrol car. The passengers told the police that Duncan had fired from the car and tossed the gun on the front floorboards. After the car was towed to a police annex, police obtained a warrant and made a more thorough search.\n\u00b63 Duncan was charged with six counts of first degree assault and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm. Duncan moved to suppress the evidence and confessions that flowed from the traffic stop on several grounds, including that the police had insufficient grounds to stop him and that their initial warrantless search of his car was improper. At the pretrial suppression hearing, held a year and a half after the events of that summer night, the judge found that the stop was justified and that the search was reasonable, and denied the motion.\n\u00b64 The jury returned guilty verdicts on all charges and found by special verdicts that Duncan was armed with a firearm. The judge sentenced Duncan to 1,159 months of incarceration, the top of the standard range. Duncan\u2019s projected release date is March 26, 2099. Mot. & Aff. to Suppl. R., Ex. A at 12. With no discussion and over no objection, the trial judge ordered Duncan to pay $2,905.54 in restitution, costs, assessments, and fines; $50 per day toward the cost of incarceration for the duration of his prison sentence; and the costs of his medical care. The State acknowledges that there was no inquiry into Duncan\u2019s ability to pay at sentencing. Am. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 24. Assuming Duncan does not accrue good time and incurs no medical expenses, amici calculate that the principal alone of his LFOs will be nearly $2 million. Amici Curiae Br. of ACLU of Wash, et al. at 1. This does not include any appellate costs that may be imposed under RCW 10.73.160(1).\n\u00b65 For the first time on appeal, Duncan challenged the trial court\u2019s imposition of the LFOs on the grounds that the record did not support a finding he had or would have any likelihood of being able to pay them. Br. of Appellant at 26-27. Despite the State\u2019s suggestion that the matter be remanded for a hearing on Duncan\u2019s ability to pay, the Court of Appeals concluded \u201cthat ability to pay LFOs is not an issue that defendants overlook\u2014it is one they reasonably waive\u201d and declined to consider it. State v. Duncan, 180 Wn. App. 245, 253, 327 P.3d 699 (2014). The Court of Appeals did not consider whether Duncan himself had reasonably waived a challenge to the LFOs. See id. It largely affirmed. Id. at 247.\n\u00b66 We stayed consideration of Duncan\u2019s petition for review pending our decision in State v. Blazina, 182 Wn.2d 827, 344 P.3d 680 (2015). Order to Stay, State v. Duncan, No. 90188-1 (Wash. July 9, 2014). After a mandate was issued in Blazina, we granted review. State v. Duncan, 183 Wn.2d 1013, 353 P.3d 641 (2015).\nAnalysis\nI. LFOs\n\u00b67 The imposition and collection of LFOs have constitutional implications and are subject to constitutional limitations. State v. Barklind, 87 Wn.2d 814, 817, 557 P.2d 314 (1976) (citing Fuller v. Oregon, 417 U.S. 40, 44-47, 94 S. Ct. 2116, 40 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1974)). A constitutionally permissible system that requires defendants to pay court ordered LFOs must meet seven requirements:\n\u201c1. Repayment must not be mandatory;\n\u201c2. Repayment may be imposed only on convicted defendants;\n\u201c3. Repayment may only be ordered if the defendant is or will be able to pay;\n\u201c4. The financial resources of the defendant must be taken into account;\n\u201c5. A repayment obligation may not be imposed if it appears there is no likelihood the defendant\u2019s indigency will end;\n\u201c6. The convicted person must be permitted to petition the court for remission of the payment of costs or any unpaid portion;\n\u201c7. The convicted person cannot be held in contempt for failure to repay if the default was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the court order or a failure to make a good faith effort to make repayment.\u201d\nState v. Curry, 118 Wn.2d 911, 915-16, 829 P.2d 166 (1992) (quoting State v. Eisenman, 62 Wn. App. 640, 644 n.10, 810 P.2d 55, 817 P.2d 867 (1991) (citing Barklind, 87 Wn.2d at 814)). The constitution does not require that the trial court enter formal findings, though of course it is a good practice and helpful on review. See id. at 915-16 (quoting Eisenman, 62 Wn. App. at 644 n.10). Had Duncan objected at trial to the LFOs sought by the State, the trial court would have been obligated to consider his present and future ability to pay before imposing the LFOs. Id.\n\u00b68 However, Duncan did not object at trial, and thus the first question we must decide is whether we should reach the issue. We recently noted that \u201ca party generally waives the right to appeal an error unless there is an objection at trial.\u201d State v. Kalebaugh, 183 Wn.2d 578, 583, 355 P.3d 253 (2015) (citing RAP 2.5(a)). But while appellate courts \u201cmay refuse to review any claim of error which was not raised in the trial court,\u201d they are not required to. RAP 2.5(a). Recently, in Blazina, we chose to exercise \u201cour own RAP 2.5 discretion [to] reach the merits and hold that a trial court has a statutory obligation to make an individualized inquiry into a defendant\u2019s current and future ability to pay before the court imposes LFOs.\u201d 182 Wn.2d at 830.\n\u00b69 We reached this issue in Blazina because we found ample and increasing evidence that unpayable LFOs \u201cimposed against indigent defendants\u201d imposed significant burdens on offenders and our community, including \u201cincreased difficulty in reentering society, the doubtful recoupment of money by the government, and inequities in administration.\u201d Id. at 835-87 (citing extensive sources). Given that, and given the fact that the trial courts had not made an individualized inquiry into the defendants\u2019 ability to pay before imposing the LFOs, we remanded to the trial court for new sentencing hearings. Id. at 839.\n\u00b610 Consistent with our opinion in Blazina and our other cases decided since then, we remand to the trial court for resentencing with proper consideration of Duncan\u2019s ability to pay LFOs. See id. at 830; see also State v. Marks, 185 Wn.2d 143, 368 P.3d 485 (2016); State v. Licon, 184 Wn.2d 1010, 359 P.3d 791 (2015); State v. Leonard, 184 Wn.2d 505, 358 P.3d 1167 (2015) (per curiam); State v. Vansycle, 183 Wn.2d 1013, 353 P.3d 634 (2015); State v. Cole, 183 Wn.2d 1013, 353 P.3d 634 (2015).\nII. Warrantless Protective Sweep\n\u00b611 We turn now to whether the warrantless search of Duncan\u2019s vehicle was lawful. Briefly, after Duncan\u2019s car was stopped and its three occupants were handcuffed in the back of separate police cars, the police \u201cwalked up to make sure there w [ere] no other occupants hiding in the vehicle.\u201d 1 CD Proceedings (Feb. 14, 2011) at 71. No one else was found, but one officer testified that he could see a gun on the floorboards. Id. at 72. Another testified that he saw shell casings and decided to search the car in order \u201cto make sure we weren\u2019t going to [be] towing a car with a handgun inside that could possibly discharge.\u201d Id.\n\u00b612 Duncan unsuccessfully moved to suppress the gun, shell casings, and passenger statements that flowed from the stop. However, without the benefit of State v. Snapp, 174 Wn.2d 177, 275 P.3d 289 (2012), the judge found the search and seizure was justified to find evidence of the crime of arrest. The judge also found the sweep of the car and the seizure of the gun were lawful because of the danger posed by an unsecured weapon in a car as it is being towed. Duncan made several challenges to the judge\u2019s CrR 3.6 ruling below that he does not renew at this court. Here, he argues that the search exceeded the permissible bounds of a protective sweep given that he and his passengers were already handcuffed and secured in separate patrol vehicles. Pet. for Review at 10.\n\u00b613 \u201c As a general rule, warrantless searches and seizures are per se unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d State v. Hendrickson, 129 Wn.2d 61, 70, 917 P.2d 563 (1996) (quoting State v. Houser, 95 Wn.2d 143, 149, 622 P.2d 1218 (1980)).\nNonetheless, there are a few \u201cjealously and carefully drawn exceptions\u201d to the warrant requirement which \u201cprovide for those cases where the societal costs of obtaining a warrant, such as danger to law officers or the risk of loss or destruction of evidence, outweigh the reasons for prior recourse to a neutral magistrate.\u201d\nHouser, 95 Wn.2d at 149 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U.S. 753, 759, 99 S. Ct. 2586, 61 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1979)). The State bears the burden of showing that the search and seizure was supported by a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement. Hendrickson, 129 Wn.2d at 71 (citing State v. Johnson, 128 Wn.2d 431, 447, 909 P.2d 293 (1996)); Snapp, 174 Wn.2d at 188 (citing State v. Kirwin, 165 Wn.2d 818, 203 P.3d 1044 (2009)). The fruits of an unconstitutional search and seizure must be suppressed. State v. Ladson, 138 Wn.2d 343, 359, 979 P.2d 833 (1999) (citing State v. Kennedy, 107 Wn.2d 1, 4, 726 P.2d 445 (1986)).\n\u00b614 Prior to Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485 (2009), the search here would have passed constitutional muster. But in the wake of Gant, we reexamined the search incident to arrest exception and found it did not justify warrantless searches of vehicles for evidence of the crime of arrest once the vehicles\u2019 occupants are detained in police cars. Snapp, 174 Wn.2d at 197, 201. Thus, the search here cannot be justified on the first ground found by the trial court.\n\u00b615 In the alternative, the State argues that the seizure of the gun was justified under the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. Suppl. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 7 (boldface omitted). However, the trial judge\u2019s order indicates he did not believe the officers could see the gun from outside the vehicle and there is nothing in this record that suggests the officers needed to open the car doors to sweep the vehicle for suspects. We find the plain view exception is not available under these facts.\n\u00b616 The State also argues that this search was \u201cessentially identical to an inventory search.\u201d Id. at 8. This argument is also not well presented by the facts. Inventory searches are authorized after vehicles are lawfully impounded. E.g., State v. Tyler, 177 Wn.2d 690, 701, 302 P.3d 165 (2013) (citing Houser, 95 Wn.2d at 154). There is nothing in the trial judge\u2019s CrR 3.6 order or the officers\u2019 testimony at the hearing that suggests the vehicle had actually been impounded at the time the vehicle was searched and the gun was seized.\n\u00b617 As amici curiae, the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys (WAPA) and the Washington State Patrol (WSP) ask us to adopt a rule that would authorize officers to search a car whenever there is reasonable suspicion it contains a firearm and the vehicle is to be released to any third party. WSP\u2019s Amicus Curiae Br. at 5, 7; Br. of Amicus Curiae WAPA at 7-8. We may, but usually do not, reach arguments raised only by amicus. Dragonslayer, Inc. v. Wash. State Gambling Comm\u2019n, 139 Wn. App. 433, 442, 161 P.3d 428 (2007) (citing Noble Manor Co. v. Pierce County, 133 Wn.2d 269, 272 n.1, 943 P.2d 1378 (1997)). While we decline to adopt so broad a rule, we find the amici\u2019s briefings helpful.\n\u00b618 As the trial court noted, \u201c[T]he presence of an unsecured firearm presented a safety risk to the officers and a danger to anyone in the area of accidently discharging while the car was being towed since a car is frequently lifted up and dropped.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 207 (stricken language omitted). A warrantless search may be justified when officers have reasonable grounds to believe that \u201cobjects likely to burn, explode or otherwise cause harm\u201d need to be secured. See State v. Downey, 53 Wn. App. 543, 544-45, 768 P.2d 502 (1989) (citing Robert Utter, Survey of Washington Search and Seizure Law: 1988 Update, 11 U. Puget Sound L. Rev. 421, 538-39 (1988)). Accordingly, we hold that under the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement, officers may make a limited sweep of a vehicle when (1) there is reasonable suspicion that an unsecured weapon is in the vehicle and (2) the vehicle has or shortly will be impounded and will be towed from the scene. See id.\n\u00b619 We caution, however, that the community caretaking exception is a strictly limited exception to the warrant requirement. State v. Kinzy, 141 Wn.2d 373, 385, 5 P.3d 668 (2000) (citing Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U.S. 433, 441, 93 S. Ct. 2523, 37 L. Ed. 2d 706 (1973)). It may not be used as a pretext for an investigatory search. Houser, 95 Wn.2d at 153 (citing State v. Hardman, 17 Wn. App. 910, 913, 567 P.2d 238 (1977)). It will only rarely justify intrusion into a private place or vehicle after an arrest. See Kinzy, 141 Wn.2d at 384-86; see also Charles W. Johnson & Debra L. Stephens, Survey of Washington Search and Seizure Law: 2013 Update, 36 Seattle U. L. Rev. 1581, 1703-04 (2013) (describing cases). In this case, we recognize that it is troubling that the trial judge denied the suppression motion in part because he found the search was justified in order to find evidence of the crime given\u2014 making it difficult to say that the officers were not motivated to find evidence. However, given the facts of this case and the fact that the sweep of the vehicle occurred before our opinion in Snapp, 174 Wn.2d 177, was announced, we are confident that the desire to remove an unsecured gun from the vehicle was not here used as a pretext for an otherwise unlawful search. See Houser, 95 Wn.2d at 153 (citing Hardman, 17 Wn. App. at 913); see also Ladson, 138 Wn.2d at 353.\nConclusion\n\u00b620 We find the LFOs imposed on Duncan are indistinguishable from those imposed on Blazina and remand for resentencing with proper consideration of his ability to pay. We conclude that under these facts, the limited search of the vehicle was lawful and affirm Duncan\u2019s conviction.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gordon McCloud, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union.\nThe Court of Appeals remanded to the trial court to strike a term of community custody the parties agreed was not statutorily authorized. Duncan, 180 Wn. App. at 247. This issue is not before us.\nWe recognize that the legislature has designated some of these fees as mandatory. E.g., RCW 7.68.035 (victim assessment); RCW 43.43.7541 (DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) collection fee); RCW 10.82.090(2)(d) (effectively making the principal on restitution mandatory). Others have been treated as mandatory by the Court of Appeals. State v. Lundy, 176 Wn. App. 96, 102, 308 P.3d 755 (2013) (holding that the filing fee imposed by RCW 36.18.020(2)(h) is mandatory and courts have no discretion to consider the offender\u2019s ability to pay). While we have not had occasion to consider the constitutionality of all of these statutes, we have found that the victim penalty assessment statute was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied to the defendants in the case because there were sufficient safeguards to prevent the defendants from being sanctioned for nonwillful failure to pay. See Curry, 118 Wn.2d at 917.\nThe State had prepared the order, which had stated the car contained \u201can unsecured firearm which was visible from outside the vehicle presented a safety risk to the officers and a danger to anyone in the area of accidently discharging while the car was being towed since a car is frequently lifted up and dropped and moved around.\u2019\u2019 Clerk\u2019s Papers at 207. The trial judge struck out the words \u201cwhich was visible from outside the vehicle.\u2019\u2019 Id.",

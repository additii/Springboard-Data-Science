        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b61 A jury convicted Andrea Rich of driving under the influence (DUI) and reckless endangerment. RCW 46.61.502; RCW 46.64.506; RCW 9A.36.050. The evidence showed that Rich was speeding in traffic while highly intoxicated and with a young child in the front passenger seat. But the officer who arrested Rich followed her car because he believed that the car was stolen; Rich\u2019s manner of driving posed no observable danger.\n\u00b62 The Court of Appeals reversed the reckless endangerment conviction, holding that the evidence was insufficient to establish that Rich\u2019s driving created an actual, substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person. State v. Rich, 186 Wn. App. 632, 347 P.3d 72, review granted, 183 Wn.2d 1018, 355 P.3d 1153 (2015). The Court of Appeals ruled, on an issue of first impression, that proof of a DUI does not necessarily establish proof of reckless endangerment. Id. at 642.\n\u00b63 We agree with the Court of Appeals that proof of DUI alone does not necessarily establish proof of reckless endangerment. But the State proved more than just DUI in this case. It also proved speeding, past a police car, in traffic, by a driver whose breath alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit, who showed awareness that she had done something wrong once stopped, and who had a young child in the front passenger seat. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, a reasonable juror could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Rich created a substantial risk of death or injury to her passenger, that Rich knew of the substantial risk, and that Rich disregarded that risk in gross deviation from the way a reasonable person would act in her situation. We therefore reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm the reckless endangerment conviction.\nFACTS\n\u00b64 On May 27, 2012, at about 8:00 p.m., Deputy Paul Mulligan of the King County Sheriff\u2019s Office was on patrol in Burien. 2 Report of Proceedings (RP) at 89. He heard a Seattle Police Department radio broadcast stating that a stolen, dark blue Acura MDX had been seen in the area. Deputy Mulligan testified that he \u201cwas in the inside lane [traveling southbound] when the stolen vehicle drove past me in the outside lane!\u2019 Id. at 75. The speed limit was \u201cabout 35 through that area \u201d Id. The deputy was \u201cdoing the flow of traffic\u201d in a marked patrol car. Id. Based on his suspicion that the car was stolen, Deputy Mulligan \u201cpulled in behind the vehicle, and was able to catch up to it at about 50 miles an hour.\u201d Id. Deputy Mulligan followed the Acura for about four blocks before it pulled into a parking lot of an apartment complex. Id. at 78. He turned on his emergency lights and parked behind the Acura. Id.\n\u00b65 The driver of the Acura, Rich, opened her car door. Id. at 79. Deputy Mulligan got out of his car but waited for backup before approaching the Acura. Id. He heard Rich say in a \u201cloud voice\u201d to the passenger, Rich\u2019s nephew who was between seven and nine years old, \u201c[T] ell them we just found the keys and we just got in the car.\u201d Id. Deputy Mulligan arrested Rich after backup arrived. Id. at 80.\n\u00b66 The officers who interacted with Rich at the time of her arrest noticed a strong odor of alcohol and observed signs of intoxication, including bloodshot, watery eyes and slurred speech. Id. at 110-12. Because Rich was wearing a walking leg cast, police officers did not administer field sobriety tests. 1 RP at 42-43. Breath alcohol tests administered at a police station approximately an hour after Rich\u2019s arrest indicated blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.183 and 0.188.2 RP at 177. Rich told police officers that she had consumed one shot of alcohol. Id. at 122.\n\u00b67 The State charged Rich with DUI, possession of a stolen vehicle, and reckless endangerment. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 6-7.\n\u00b68 At trial, Rich testified that she was just getting into the car when the police officer pulled up behind her. 2 RP at 191. She said that her nephew brought the keys to her just before the police arrived and that he was in the car with her. Id. at 191, 198. Rich testified that she had consumed one or two shots of alcohol and that she was \u201ctipsy,\u201d but she also claimed that the alcohol did not affect her. Id. at 205, 201, 194.\n\u00b69 The state forensic toxicologist testified that a person would have to consume about 9 to 10 shots of standard proof alcohol to achieve a blood alcohol reading of 0.188. 2 RP at 134. He also testified that a person burns off alcohol at an average rate of 0.015 per hour. Id.\n\u00b610 The jury convicted Rich of DUI and reckless endangerment\u2014both gross misdemeanors\u2014but acquitted her of possessing a stolen vehicle. CP at 47-49. The jury also returned a special verdict stating that Rich\u2019s alcohol concentration level was \u201c0.15 or higher within two hours after driving.\u201d CP at 50. The court imposed a sentence of 120 days of confinement on the DUI conviction and 20 days on the reckless endangerment conviction. CP at 54; Tr. of Trial (July 26, 2013) at 4.\n\u00b611 Rich appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed Rich\u2019s reckless endangerment conviction and affirmed the DUI conviction. Rich, 186 Wn. App. 632. The Court of Appeals held that no evidence showed Rich\u2019s driving specifically posed an actual risk of death or serious injury that was considerable or substantial. Id. at 647. The court also held that evidence Rich was under the influence of alcohol, alone, did not support the conviction. Id.\n\u00b612 This court granted the State\u2019s petition for review. Rich, 183 Wn.2d 1018. The question presented is whether the evidence was sufficient to support Rich\u2019s reckless endangerment conviction.\nANALYSIS\nI. Standard of Review\n\u00b613 This case requires us to decide if evidence that Rich was speeding in traffic with a young passenger in the front seat of the car while she was highly intoxicated was sufficient to support her reckless endangerment conviction. The sufficiency of the evidence is a question of constitutional law that we review de novo. State v. Berg, 181 Wn.2d 857, 867, 337 P.3d 310 (2014).\n\u00b614 The State bears the burden of proving all the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970); U.S. Const, amend. XIV; Wash. Const, art. I, \u00a7 3. To determine if sufficient evidence supports a conviction, we consider \u201c \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d State v. Green, 94 Wn.2d 216, 221, 616 P.2d 628 (1980) (plurality opinion) (some emphasis omitted) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)). \u201c[inferences based on circumstantial evidence must be reasonable and cannot be based on speculation.\u201d State v. Vasquez, 178 Wn.2d 1, 16, 309 P.3d 318 (2013). A \u201c \u2018modicum\u2019 \u201d of evidence does not meet this standard. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 320.\nII. A Person Commits Reckless Endangerment by Creating a Substantial Risk of Death or Injury to Another Person\n\u00b615 The State charged Rich with reckless endangerment, not reckless driving. RCW 9A.36.050(1), which defines \u201creckless endangerment,\u201d states, \u201cA person is guilty of reckless endangerment when he or she recklessly engages in conduct not amounting to drive-by shooting but that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person.\u201d\n\u00b616 Thus, to obtain a conviction, the State must first prove \u201creckless[ ] ... conduct.\u201d RCW 9A.36.050(1). The mens rea of recklessness has both a subjective and an objective component. RCW 9A.08.010(l)(c) states, \u201cA person is reckless or acts recklessly when he or she knows of and disregards a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and his or her disregard of such substantial risk is a gross deviation from conduct that a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Whether Rich\u2019s conduct was reckless therefore \u201c \u2018depends on both what [she] knew and how a reasonable person would have acted knowing these facts.\u2019 \u201d State v. Graham, 153 Wn.2d 400, 408, 103 P.3d 1238 (2005) (quoting State v. R.H.S., 94 Wn. App. 844, 847, 974 P.2d 1253 (1999)).\n\u00b617 The State must also prove \u201ca substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person.\u201d RCW 9A.36.050(1). A \u201crisk,\u201d of course, is not a certainty. See Graham, 153 Wn.2d at 407 (reckless endangerment is an inchoate crime; distinguishing between reckless endangerment, on the one hand, which subjects defendant to conviction based on risk her conduct poses, and assault or homicide, on the other hand, which require proof that harmful consequences actually occurred). And although no statute defines \u201cserious physical injury,\u201d RCW 9A.04.110(4)(a) defines \u201cphysical injury\u201d as \u201cphysical pain or injury, illness, or an impairment of physical condition.\u201d No statute defines \u201csubstantial\u201d either, but in State v. McKague, we defined \u201csubstantial\u201d (as used in the statute defining \u201csecond degree assault\u201d) as \u201c \u2018considerable in amount, value, or worth\u2019 \u201d and more than just \u201chaving some existence.\u201d 172 Wn.2d 802, 806, 262 P.3d 1225 (2011) (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2280 (2002)); RCW 9A.36.021(1)(a).\n\u00b618 Taken together, to convict Rich of reckless endangerment, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Rich knew of and disregarded a considerable risk\u2014not a certainty\u2014of death or serious physical pain or injury that her conduct posed to her young nephew, and that her behavior constituted a gross deviation from how a reasonable person would have acted based on the known facts.\nIII. Evidence of Intoxication Alone or Speed Alone, without More, Does Not Constitute Reckless Endangerment\n\u00b619 Rich argues that proof of DUI alone is insufficient to prove reckless endangerment. Resp\u2019t\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 8. She also asserts that proof of speeding alone is insufficient to prove reckless endangerment. Id. at 13.\n\u00b620 This is, in part, a question of statutory interpretation; we therefore begin by looking at the language of the relevant statutes. Kitsap County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Guild v. Kitsap County, 183 Wn.2d 358, 378, 353 P.3d 188 (2015) (plurality opinion). As discussed supra, the reckless endangerment statute requires proof that the defendant knows of and disregards a substantial risk and that the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes a gross deviation from the way that a reasonable person would act in the same situation. RCW 9A.36.050U); RCW 9A.08.010(l)(c). DUI, however, contains no such mens rea element. RCW 46.61.502(1); see State v. Dailey, 174 Wn. App. 810, 815-16, 300 P.3d 834 (2013). For this reason alone, proof of DUI, without more, does not establish proof of reckless endangerment. Reckless endangerment requires proof of something more.\n\u00b621 Similarly, speeding requires only proof of a violation of the traffic code. See Clement v. Dep\u2019t of Licensing, 109 Wn. App. 371, 375 n.10, 35 P.3d 1171 (2001) (citing City of Bremerton v. Spears, 134 Wn.2d 141, 158, 949 P.2d 347 (1998)). For this reason alone, proof of speeding, without more, does not establish proof of reckless endangerment. Reckless endangerment requires proof of something more.\n\u00b622 This conclusion is consistent with the conclusion we reached on this issue in the reckless driving context. In State v. Hanna, this Court upheld the validity of an instruction allowing a jury to draw an inference of reckless driving from proof of speeding. 123 Wn.2d 704, 712-13, 871 P.2d 135 (1994). Thereafter, in Hanna v. Riveland, 87 F.3d 1034 (9th Cir. 1996), the court ruled that that instruction created an impermissible inference in violation of the right to due process\u2014a fact about which this court said it was \u201cnot unmindful\u201d when deciding State v. Randhawa, 133 Wn.2d 67, 77 n.3, 941 P.2d 661 (1997), a few years later. Thus, in Randhawa, we clarified that speeding, alone, does not necessarily give rise to an inference of recklessness. Id. at 77 (\u201c[W]e cannot say with substantial assurance that the inferred fact, Randhawa\u2019s reckless driving, more likely than not flowed from the proved fact\u2014Randhawa\u2019s speed. That is so because the facts relating to Randhawa\u2019s speed were not nearly as egregious as those in Hanna . . . .\u201d). We reaffirm that holding now: that speeding, alone, does not necessarily prove recklessness. But in this case, the State did not rely on evidence of Rich\u2019s speed, alone, to support the reckless endangerment conviction.\n\u00b623 Similarly, in State v. Birch, 183 Wash. 670, 673, 49 P.2d 921 (1935), we held that driving under the influence of alcohol does not, on its own, constitute reckless driving. We explained that the jury must determine \u201c[w]hether or not, in any particular case, the extent of the use of intoxicating liquor influenced the manner of driving.\u201d Id. at 674-75. This reasoning supports our conclusion here that the court must consider the specific facts of the case to decide if the defendant, under the particular circumstances, knew of and disregarded a considerable risk that her conduct posed and that her behavior constituted a gross deviation from reasonable behavior.\n\u00b624 Rich cites Commonwealth v. Mastromatteo, 719 A.2d 1081, 1083 (Pa. Super. 1998), in which the intermediate appellate court interpreted a statute similar to Washington\u2019s reckless endangerment statute and held that DUI does not constitute recklessness per se. But, as discussed in more detail in Part IV below, the State did not rely only on DUI evidence to support Rich\u2019s conviction.\n\u00b625 Rich also claims, \u201cImportantly, the State did not present any statistical evidence to substantiate its bare assertion during closing argument that driving drunk creates a high risk of accident causing serious physical injury or death.\u201d Resp\u2019t\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 9. She cites Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 140, 128 S. Ct. 1581, 170 L. Ed. 2d 490 (2008) and Johnson v. United States, _ U.S. _, 135 S. Ct. 2551, 2557, 192 L. Ed. 2d 569 (2015).\n\u00b626 Begay and Johnson, however, were not sufficiency of the evidence cases. Those cases interpreted\u2014in two different ways\u2014the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the former Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), which imposes a mandatory sentencing enhancement on felons who unlawfully possess a firearm and have three or more convictions for violent felonies. Begay, 553 U.S. at 148. The residual clause defines an offense as a qualifying violent felony if it \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). In Begay, the Court held that it had to \u201cconsider the offense generically .... [W] e examine it in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\u201d Id. at 141. Rich cites Justice Scalia\u2019s concurrence in that case, which concluded that drunk driving does not clearly present a serious risk of injury to another within the statute\u2019s meaning. Id. at 148.\n\u00b627 Begay\u2019s holding is not applicable to either the subjective or objective inquiry here. In this case, we do not look at reckless endangerment generically; rather, we consider the specific evidence admitted to determine if it was constitutionally sufficient to support the conviction.\n\u00b628 In Johnson, the Supreme Court held that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague because it defined a qualifying offense at too high a level of generality. 135 S. Ct. at 2557. This case does not involve overly broad definitions; rather, the question before us is whether specific evidence was sufficient to support Rich\u2019s conviction.\nIV. A Reasonable Juror Could Conclude beyond a Reasonable Doubt That Rich Created a Subjectively and Objectively Unreasonable and Substantial Risk of Death or Serious Physical Injury to Another\n\u00b629 The question remains whether any reasonable juror could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Rich created a subjectively and objectively unreasonable and substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another. The Court of Appeals reversed because the State failed to prove an \u201c \u2018actual\u2019 \u201d risk of death or serious physical injury that was \u201cconsiderable or substantial.\u201d Rich, 186 Wn. App. at 647 (quoting McKague, 172 Wn.2d at 805).\n\u00b630 The State acknowledges that it lacked proof of actual erratic driving or actual harm. It contends that such proof was not necessary.\n\u00b631 Rich, on the other hand, focuses on the absence of erratic driving or any resulting harm. She contends that despite her intoxication, she \u201cwas not incapacitated [;] [s]he was able to walk, waive her rights and answer questions, and submit to a breathalyzer,\u201d and that \u201c[t]here was no evidence that she had swerved or driven erratically.\u201d Resp\u2019t\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 12-13. She also argues that her nephew was secure in the car and that no external circumstances in the environment tended to show the creation of a substantial risk. Id. at 14.\n\u00b632 But none of that really responds to the State\u2019s argument that it need not prove actual erratic driving or actual harm to prove reckless endangerment. Indeed, there is no good response to the State\u2019s interpretation; Rich\u2019s argument would eliminate the word \u201crisk\u201d from the crime\u2019s language.\n\u00b633 With that interpretation in mind, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. The record clearly reveals more than proof of only DUI or only speeding. Evidence also showed that Rich knew that the legal blood alcohol limit in Washington is 0.08. 2 RP at 194. Further, the evidence showed that Rich knew that she was driving while \u201ctipsy.\u201d Id. at 205. Indeed, Rich\u2019s loud comments to her nephew show that she was trying to cover up the fact that she had done something wrong. Id. at 79. A reasonable juror could conclude that Rich knew driving while \u201ctipsy\u201d could cause an accident, and that she disregarded that risk in a gross deviation from conduct a reasonable person would exercise in a similar situation. Id. at 205; RCW 9A.08.010(1)(c). This satisfies the subjective component of reckless conduct.\n\u00b634 In addition, Deputy Mulligan testified that Rich passed his marked police car in the right lane. The jury could infer from his testimony that Rich was speeding when she passed him. 2 RP at 75. The evidence also showed that she was driving in traffic, not in a deserted area. She had a young child in the front passenger\u2019s seat. Officers testified that Rich, once stopped, spoke in an abnormally loud voice with odd speech patterns and that based on her demeanor, the smell of alcohol, and the appearance of her eyes, they concluded that she was intoxicated. Id. at 81, 105, 107, 110-12, 146, 148. As discussed above, her blood alcohol level about one hour after her arrest was 0.183 to 0.188. Id. at 194. A toxicologist testified that to reach a blood alcohol level of 0.188, a person would have to consume about 9 to 10 shots of standard proof alcohol. Id. at 134. The toxicologist also testified that any amount over a 0.08 blood alcohol level would render a person unable to operate a motor vehicle safely. Id. at 133. This evidence\u2014taken together\u2014is sufficient to satisfy the objective component of reckless conduct: a reasonable person would recognize the substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to Rich\u2019s nephew seated in the front of the car by her conduct of speeding in traffic while having a blood alcohol level of more than twice the legal limit, which affected her speech and her behavior, and knowing that she was \u201ctipsy.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b635 Evidence of DUI, alone, is not sufficient to prove reckless endangerment. Evidence of speeding, alone, is not sufficient to prove reckless endangerment. But here, the record contains evidence of DUI, of speeding, of extreme intoxication, of Rich\u2019s knowledge that she was \u201ctipsy,\u201d and of Rich engaging in all of this behavior while in traffic with a young child in the front seat. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any reasonable juror could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Rich recklessly engaged in conduct that created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to her nephew and that it constituted a gross deviation from the way a reasonable person would act in her situation. We therefore reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate Rich\u2019s reckless endangerment conviction.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nReckless endangerment is not exclusively a driving offense. It is located in the general criminal code, Title 9A RCW, rather than in the motor vehicle code, Title 46 RCW. A separate statute, RCW 46.61.500, prohibits \u201creckless driving,\u2019\u2019 which is \u201cdriv[ing] any vehicle in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u2019\u2019 RCW 46.61.500(1).",

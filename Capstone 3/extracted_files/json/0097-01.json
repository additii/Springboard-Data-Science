        "text": "Owens, J.\n\u00b61 Courts generally avoid reviewing ballot initiatives before they have been enacted into law, but a few limited types of challenges can be appropriately reviewed prior to election: procedural challenges (such as sufficiency of signatures and ballot titles) and challenges asserting that the initiative is not within the scope of the legislative authority granted to local residents. The first issue in this case is who has standing to bring those types of challenges. The Court of Appeals created new limits on who can bring such challenges, but we reverse and adhere to our existing standards because they adequately ensure that only those affected by an ordinance may challenge it. Applying those existing standards, we find that petitioners in this case had standing to bring this challenge. The second issue in this case is the substance of the petitioners\u2019 challenge: whether the initiative\u2019s subject matter falls within the scope of authority granted to local residents. This initiative attempts to regulate a variety of subjects outside this scope of authority, including administrative matters, water law, and constitutional rights. Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that this local initiative exceeds the scope of local initiative power and should not be put on the ballot.\nFACTS\n\u00b62 In 2013, Envision Spokane gathered enough signatures to place a local initiative on the ballot that would establish a \u201cCommunity Bill of Rights\u201d (referred to herein as the Envision Initiative or initiative). Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 39. The Envision Initiative would amend the city of Spokane\u2019s charter to add a \u201cCommunity Bill of Rights\u201d that contained four primary provisions relating to zoning changes, water rights, workplace rights, and the rights of corporations. Id. at 39-40.\n\u00b63 First, the initiative would require any proposed zoning changes involving large developments to be approved by voters in the neighborhood. Second, it would give the Spokane River the legal right to \u201cexist and flourish,\u201d including the rights to sustainable recharge, sufficient flows to support native fish, and clean water. Id. at 40. It would also give Spokane residents the right to access and use water in the city, as well as the right to enforce the Spokane River\u2019s new rights. Third, it attempts to give employees the protections of the Bill of Rights against their employer in the workplace. Fourth, it would strip the legal rights of any corporation that violated the rights secured in the charter. Id.\n\u00b64 Petitioners filed this declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of the Envision Initiative. The petitioners include Spokane County, individual residents of Spokane (including two city council members acting in their individual capacities), for-profit corporations and companies in Spokane (including Pearson Packaging Systems and the utility company Avista Corporation), and nonprofit associations (including the Spokane Association of Realtors, the Spokane Building Owners and Managers Association, the Spokane Home Builders Association, and local chambers of commerce). See id. at 8-13.\n\u00b65 The trial judge ruled that (1) petitioners had standing to challenge the initiative and (2) the initiative exceeded the scope of the local initiative power. She therefore instructed that it be struck from the ballot. Envision Spokane appealed, and the Court of Appeals held that petitioners lacked standing and ordered the initiative be put on the next available ballot. Spokane Entrepreneurial Ctr. v. Spokane Moves to Amend Constitution, No. 31887-7-III, slip op. at 18-19 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2015) (unpublished), http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/318877.unp.pdf. We granted review. Spokane Entrepreneurial Ctr. v. Spokane Moves to Amend Constitution, 183 Wn.2d 1017, 355 P.3d 1153 (2015).\nISSUES\n\u00b66 1. Do petitioners have standing to bring this challenge?\n\u00b67 2. Does the Envision Initiative exceed the scope of local initiative power?\nANALYSIS\n1. Under Our Existing Standing Requirements, Petitioners Have Standing\n\u00b68 This case involves the intersection of our rules regarding standing in declaratory judgment actions and our rules regarding preelection challenges to initiatives. The Court of Appeals found these rules to be in tension with each other, noting that our liberal standing requirements seemed to conflict with limits on preelection judicial review of initiatives. Spokane Entrepreneurial Ctr., No. 31887-7-III, slip op. at 9-10. Because of this conflict, the Court of Appeals applied heightened standing requirements for this type of action.\n\u00b69 As explained below, we decline to adopt heightened standing requirements for this type of action. Our case law has consistently applied existing standing requirements for declaratory judgment actions, and we believe the concerns regarding preelection review of initiatives are properly addressed by our limits on the types of challenges that courts will review prior to elections.\nA. Existing standing requirements limit who can bring declaratory judgment actions\n\u00b610 To challenge the Envision Initiative, petitioners filed an action under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, chapter 7.24 RCW. That statute allows a person whose rights are affected by a statute or municipal ordinance to \u201chave determined any question of construction or validity\u201d of that statute or ordinance, and to \u201cobtain a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d RCW 7.24.020. At issue in this case is whether petitioners had standing to file that declaratory judgment action.\n\u00b611 \u201cThe standing doctrine prohibits a litigant from raising another\u2019s legal rights.\u201d Walker v. Munro, 124 Wn.2d 402, 419, 879 P.2d 920 (1994). This court\u2019s test for standing in declaratory judgment actions has two requirements. First, the interest sought to be protected must be \u201c \u2018arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.\u2019 \u201d Grant County Fire Prot. Dist. No. 5 v. City of Moses Lake, 150 Wn.2d 791, 802, 83 P.3d 419 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Save a Valuable Env\u2019t v. City of Bothell, 89 Wn.2d 862, 866, 576 P.2d 401 (1978)). Second, the challenged action must have caused \u201c \u2018injury in fact,\u2019 economic or otherwise, to the party seeking standing.\u201d Id. (quoting Save a Valuable Env\u2019t, 89 Wn.2d at 866).\nB. Existing rules strictly limit preelection judicial review of initiatives\n\u00b612 As a preliminary issue, it is important to distinguish statewide and local initiatives. The right of the people to file a statewide initiative is laid out in the Washington Constitution. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1(a). Because it is a constitutional right, Washington courts interpret the rules regarding statewide initiatives to facilitate this right. Coppernoll v. Reed, 155 Wn.2d 290, 296, 119 P.3d 318 (2005); In re Estate of Thompson, 103 Wn.2d 292, 294-95, 692 P.2d 807 (1984).\n\u00b613 However, the right to file a local initiative is not granted in the constitution. Instead, state statutes governing the establishment of cities allow the cities to establish a local initiative process. See RCW 35.22.200 (\u201cThe [city] charter may provide for direct legislation by the people through the initiative and referendum upon any matter within the scope of the powers, functions, or duties of the city.\u201d).\n\u00b614 We have expressed great concern about reviewing initiatives prior to enactment. This concern has been attributed to both \u201cthe constitutional preeminence of the right of initiative,\u201d Coppernoll, 155 Wn.2d at 297. There are also general concerns that \u201cthe courts should not interfere in the electoral and legislative processes, and that the courts should not render advisory opinions.\u201d Seattle Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council v. City of Seattle, 94 Wn.2d 740, 746, 620 P.2d 82 (1980). To address these concerns, we strictly limit the type of preelection challenges courts will review. Courts will not consider a challenge to the substantive validity of a statewide initiative prior to the election. Coppernoll, 155 Wn.2d at 297. Courts will generally review only two types of challenges\u2014procedural challenges (such as sufficiency of signatures and ballot titles) and whether the subject matter is proper for direct legislation. Id. at 298-99. As we have explained, this second type of challenge is typically aimed at local initiatives because of the \u201cmore limited powers of initiatives under city or county charters.\u201d Id. at 299. Thus, while \u201c[generally, judicial preelection review of initiatives and referendums is disfavored . . . courts will review local initiatives and referendums to determine, notably, whether \u2018the proposed law is beyond the scope of the initiative power.\u2019 \u201d City of Port Angeles v. Our Water-Our Choice!, 170 Wn.2d 1, 7, 239 P.3d 589 (2010) (quoting Seattle Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 94 Wn.2d at 746).\n\u00b615 Based on our court\u2019s concerns about preelection review of an initiative, the Court of Appeals concluded that even in the context of an allowable challenge to an initiative, petitioners must meet heightened standing requirements. We now clarify that these rules address different concerns and should not be conflated. \u201c \u2018The kernel of the standing doctrine is that one who is not adversely affected by a statute may not question its validity.\u2019 \u201d Grant County, 150 Wn.2d at 802 (quoting Walker, 124 Wn.2d at 419). In contrast, our limits on preelection review ensure that we do not address the substantive validity of a statute before it is enacted. Requiring challengers to meet heightened standing requirements does nothing to help the court avoid addressing the substantive validity of a statute before it is enacted, it only limits the groups of people who can challenge initiatives. Therefore, if a case involves one of the few types of allowable preelection initiative challenges, petitioners should have to meet only our traditional standing requirements.\nC. Applying our existing standing requirements, petitioners had standing to challenge the Envision Initiative\n\u00b616 Applying those existing standing requirements, we hold that petitioners in this case have standing to bring their challenge. First, petitioners must show that the interest they are seeking to protect is arguably within the zone of interests that the initiative will protect or regulate. As the Court of Appeals noted, one of the petitioners\u2019 strongest arguments regarding this prong relates to the initiative\u2019s provision giving the Spokane River water rights. Two of the petitioners actively use the Spokane River\u2014Spokane County (which maintains a sewage treatment plant on the river) and Avista Corporation (a utility company that, among other things, stores water in Lake Coeur d\u2019Alene that might otherwise flow into the Spokane River). The Court of Appeals found that these would arguably put the petitioners within the zone of interests regulated by the initiative but that this was not sufficient in the context of a preelection challenge. Spokane Entrepreneurial Ctr., No. 31887-7-III, slip op. at 11-12. In light of our holding that petitioners are not subject to heightened standing requirements, we hold that petitioners are certainly within the zone of interests that the initiative protects or regulates. The initiative gives the Spokane River its own water rights, including the rights to sustainable recharge, sufficient flows to support native fish, and clean water. This protects or regulates the water of the Spokane River, which petitioners use pursuant to state and federal law. Similarly, housing builders and developers would be within the zone of interests regulated by the initiative\u2019s provision requiring an additional level of approval from neighborhood residents for all major developments. Petitioners meet the first standing requirement.\n\u00b617 Second, petitioners must show injury in fact, economic or otherwise. If we were to require that a petitioner show that an injury had already occurred, no challenger could ever meet this requirement for an initiative that had not yet been enacted. However, we have not required challengers to local initiatives to show that an injury has already occurred. Instead, we have allowed petitioners to show that they would suffer an injury in fact if the law were to pass. For example, in Grant County, we held that property owners \u201cclearly\u201d met the \u201cactual injury\u201d standing requirement because they \u201cface different tax rates following annexation.\u201d 150 Wn.2d at 802-03. Similarly, in Mukilteo Citizens for Simple Government v. City of Mukilteo, 174 Wn.2d 41, 46, 272 P.3d 227 (2012), we found that an association of city residents had standing to challenge a proposed initiative because the individual members had standing as \u201cMukilteo residents who are eligible to vote.\u201d\n\u00b618 In this case, petitioners will face injury if the initiative passes. The clearest examples arise from the provisions of the initiative that (1) assign water rights that conflict with water rights held pursuant to state law and (2) create a new zoning approval process. Petitioners include a utility company and a county entity that use the Spokane River pursuant to existing state law that would certainly suffer harm if others were given conflicting water rights related to the Spokane River. Similarly, the petitioner builders and developers would suffer harm by having to go through an additional zoning approval process. Regardless of whether these harms might be justified or offset by other societal benefits, these petitioners will suffer harm. Therefore, they meet the second requirement for standing and can bring a challenge to the initiative.\n2. The Envision Initiative Exceeds the Scope of Local Initiative Power\n\u00b619 Having found that petitioners have standing to challenge the Envision Initiative, the next question is whether the initiative exceeds the scope of the local initiative power. As described below, the local initiative power is limited to legislative matters that are within the authority of the city. In this case, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that all four provisions of the Envision Initiative were outside the scope of the local initiative power, as they either dealt with nonlegislative matters or were outside the authority of the city.\n\u00b620 There are multiple limits on the local initiative power, three of which apply in this case. First, \u201cadministrative matters, particularly local administrative matters, are not subject to initiative or referendum.\u201d Our Water-Our Choice!, 170 Wn.2d at 8. \u201cGenerally speaking, a local government action is administrative if it furthers (or hinders) a plan the local government or some power superior to it has previously adopted.\u201d Id. at 10. We have noted that \u201c[d]iscerning whether a proposed initiative is administrative or legislative in nature can be difficult.\u201d Id. In one case, we described the question as \u201cwhether the proposition is one to make new law or declare a new policy, or merely to carry out and execute law or policy already in existence.\u201d Ruano v. Spellman, 81 Wn.2d 820, 823, 505 P.2d 447 (1973).\n\u00b621 Similarly, a local initiative \u201cis beyond the scope of the initiative power if the initiative involves powers granted by the legislature to the governing body of a city, rather than the city itself.\u201d City of Sequim v. Malkasian, 157 Wn.2d 251, 261, 138 P.3d 943 (2006). As this court has explained, a grant of authority to the city\u2019s legislative body means the city council or mayor, not the electorate. Id. at 265.\n\u00b622 Finally, the provisions of a local initiative must be within the scope of the authority of the city itself. As we have explained, \u201cWhile the inhabitants of a municipality may enact legislation governing local affairs, they cannot enact legislation which conflicts with state law.\u201d Seattle Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 94 Wn.2d at 747. In that case, we reviewed a Seattle initiative that would have halted certain Interstate 90 construction projects. Id. at 742. We struck down the initiative\u2014prior to it being put on the ballot\u2014holding that it dealt with matters that the city had no authority to regulate: \u201cthe location and construction of state limited access facilities.\u201d Id. at 749.\n\u00b623 The trial court found that all four of the Envision Initiative provisions were outside the scope of the initiative power. We discuss each provision in turn.\n\u00b624 The first provision would require any proposed zoning changes involving large developments to be approved by voters in the neighborhood. The trial court ruled that this provision dealt with administrative matters and was thus outside the scope of the initiative power. We affirm this ruling. The city of Spokane has already adopted processes for zoning and development. This provision would modify those processes for zoning and development decisions, which falls under our description of an administrative matter since it deals with carrying out and executing laws or policies already in existence. See Ruano, 81 Wn.2d at 823.\n\u00b625 The second provision would give the Spokane River the legal right to \u201cexist and flourish,\u201d including the rights to sustainable recharge, sufficient flows to support native fish, and clean water. CP at 40. It would also give Spokane residents the right to access and use water in the city, as well as the right to enforce the Spokane River\u2019s new rights. Id. The trial court ruled that this provision was outside of the scope of the local initiative power because it conflicted with state law, which already determines the water rights for the Spokane River. The trial court noted that this provision was particularly problematic because it dealt with an aquifer that is actually located in Idaho, which is outside of the city\u2019s authority. The trial court also ruled that this provision was administrative in nature because it would deal with how an existing regulatory scheme is implemented. We affirm. This broad provision is directly contrary to the water rights system established by the State and is outside the scope of the city\u2019s authority.\n\u00b626 The third provision attempts to give employees the protections of the Bill of Rights against their employer in the workplace. The trial court ruled that this provision was outside of the scope of the local initiative power because (1) municipalities cannot expand constitutional protections and (2) this provision would conflict with state and federal labor laws. We affirm. Expanding the Bill of Rights to apply to private persons and entities, not just state actors, is a federal constitutional issue that is outside the scope of local authority. See Ford v. Logan, 79 Wn.2d 147, 156, 483 P.2d 1247 (1971) (\u201cAmendment of our constitution is not a legislative act and thus is not within the initiative power reserved to the voters.\u201d).\n\u00b627 The fourth provision would strip the legal rights of any corporation that violated the rights secured in the charter. This appears to be a response to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310, 342-43, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010), which held that corporations have rights under the federal constitution. The trial court ruled that this provision was outside of the scope of the local initiative power because it directly conflicts with federal and state law. We affirm this ruling because municipalities cannot strip constitutional rights from entities and cannot undo decisions of the United States Supreme Court.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b628 While preelection challenges to initiatives are disfavored, two types of challenges can be brought prior to election. For those allowable challenges, we continue to apply our existing standing rules. Under those rules, petitioners had standing to challenge this initiative. As to the underlying issue, we hold that the initiative exceeded the scope of local legislative authority and thus should not be put on the ballot.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, Gordon McCloud, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nReconsideration denied April 1, 2016.",

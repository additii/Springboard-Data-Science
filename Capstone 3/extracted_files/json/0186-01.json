        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b61 Bart Rowley Sr. was injured while driving a truck for his employer, and he subsequently filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The Department of Labor and Industries (Department) denied Rowley\u2019s claim because it determined that Rowley was injured while committing a felony: possession of a controlled substance. The Industrial Insurance Act (IIA), Title 51 RCW, bars payment of workers\u2019 compensation under that circumstance. RCW 51.32.020. Rowley filed a notice of appeal to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (Board). After considering testimony from several witnesses, an industrial appeals judge (IAJ) found that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the Department\u2019s decision and ordered the Department to approve Rowley\u2019s claim.\n\u00b62 The Department has challenged that order four times: in an appeal before a three-member board panel, at the superior court, at the Court of Appeals, and finally in this court. Every lower court affirmed the IAJ\u2019s decision that Rowley was entitled to benefits. Although we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding on the applicable evidentiary standard, we too agree that Rowley is entitled to benefits.\nFACTS\n\u00b63 Bart Rowley worked as a truck driver for 33 years. Rowley was severely injured when his truck-trailer veered off a highway overpass and landed on the roadway below. The accident occurred midday on a clear and dry day. Suspecting that drug use might have been a contributing factor, law enforcement sent Officer Donevan Dexheimer, a trained drug recognition officer, to Harborview hospital, where Rowley was treated after the accident. At Harborview, an emergency room (ER) nurse provided Officer Dexheimer with a \u201cbaggie\u201d that she said had come from Rowley\u2019s pocket. The baggie contained residue that Officer Dexheimer believed to be methamphetamine. Officer Dexheimer also had Rowley\u2019s blood drawn and submitted to the Washington State Toxicology Laboratory (Lab) for testing.\n\u00b64 Rowley filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The Department rejected Rowley\u2019s claim, finding that it was barred by RCW 51.32.020. The relevant part of that statute provides:\nIf injury or death results to a worker from the deliberate intention of the worker himself or herself to produce such injury or death, or while the worker is engaged in the attempt to commit, or the commission of, a felony, neither the worker nor the widow, widower, child, or dependent of the worker shall receive any payment under this title.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\u00b65 As will be discussed in more detail below, this statute contains two bars to payment of a workers\u2019 compensation claim: the deliberate self-injury bar (not at issue in this case) and the felony payment bar (at issue in this case). In its order denying benefits, the Department appeared to conflate the two payment bars and thus paraphrased the statute inaccurately:\nCLAIM IS REJECTED BASED [ON] RCW 51.32.020 WHICH STATES IF INJURY OR DEATH RESULTS TO A WORKER FROM THE DELIBERATE INTENTION OF THE WORKER HIMSELF . . . WHILE THE WORKER IS ENGAGED IN THE ATTEMPT TO COMMIT, OR THE COMMISSION OF, A FELONY .... SHALL NOT RECEIVE ANY PAYMENT UNDER THIS TITLE.\nClerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 275 (alterations in original).\n\u00b66 Rowley filed a request for reconsideration, which the Department denied. He then filed a notice of appeal with the Board. The Board granted Rowley a hearing before IAJ Kathleen Stockman.\n\u00b67 Consistent with Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 263-12-115(2)(a), which provides that \u201c[i]n any appeal under . . . the [IIA] . . . , the appealing party shall initially introduce all evidence in his or her case in-chief,\u201d Rowley presented his evidence first. He called only two witnesses: himself and the office manager for his employer. Consistent with WAC 263-12-115(2)(c), the Department then presented its case in chief. It called six witnesses: Officer Dexheimer; Brian Capron, a forensic specialist from the Lab; Washington State Trooper David Roberts, the first responder to Rowley\u2019s accident; Washington State Trooper Nicholas King; Mary Comstock, a nurse who treated Rowley in the ER; and Jennifer Compton, another ER nurse who treated Rowley.\n\u00b68 The office manager for Rowley\u2019s employer testified that Rowley was working when the accident occurred. She thus provided evidence of injury during the course of employment. Rowley testified that he was in a coma for 40 days after the accident and could not remember anything about the events leading up to it. But he also testified that he had taken random drug tests many times over the course of his employment and was not aware of ever testing positive. He thus presented some evidence from which an inference could be drawn that he did not possess drugs at the time of his accident.\n\u00b69 The Department then called Officer Dexheimer; he testified that he was trained to identify both signs of impairment and types of drugs. He also testified about his interactions with nurses treating Rowley. He stated that a nurse (either Nurse Comstock or Nurse Compton) told him that Rowley \u201chad a quote/unquote \u2018surprise\u2019 in his pocket when he arrived.\u201d CP at 737. Officer Dexheimer explained that he could not perform a field sobriety test on Rowley because Rowley was unconscious, but that he measured Rowley\u2019s pulse, listened to the conversations occurring between the treating nurses, and got Nurse Comstock to help him find Rowley\u2019s clothes and a baggie with some suspected methamphetamine residue in it. Rowley\u2019s pulse was normal, but Officer Dexheimer testified that he believed this was unusual because hospital staff had given Rowley morphine and Valium. Under those circumstances, Officer Dexheimer considered Rowley\u2019s pulse high, possibly indicating use of a central nervous system stimulant prior to the accident. On one hand, Officer Dexheimer testified that he could not form an opinion about whether Rowley was impaired by drug use because he could not perform a proper field sobriety test. On the other hand, he testified that \u201ccoming down\u201d from stimulants could cause a person to fall asleep at the wheel and that this might explain Rowley\u2019s accident. CP at 751. He also stated that he arrested Rowley for driving under the influence of an intoxicant (DUI) (while Rowley was unconscious in the hospital), and he opined that the accident \u201cmore likely than not\u201d occurred because Rowley was affected by methamphetamine. CP at 754.\n\u00b610 Officer Dexheimer also testified that he asked Nurse Comstock where the baggie was and that she told him Rowley\u2019s clothes and the baggie were both in the trash. He related the following exchange with Nurse Comstock:\nSo she pointed out - We looked through the garbage bag that was actually still in the room, and it was nearly empty. She says, \u201cNo, this isn\u2019t the right bag.\u201d We went outside, we opened up the garbage bag, and she started opening the bags that were inside, and she says, \u201coh, here it is,\u201d hands it to me, or points it out to me. I can\u2019t remember whether she actually physically handed it to me or just said, \u201cThat\u2019s the one. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nCP at 746. When Officer Dexheimer saw the baggie, he determined that the residue in it looked like methamphetamine. He explained that this was because of its color, texture, and packaging.\n\u00b611 Finally, Officer Dexheimer testified that he provided Nurse Comstock with two vials so she could draw Rowley\u2019s blood. Officer Dexheimer labeled these vials with Rowley\u2019s name, but could not remember whether he also labeled them with the date or the case number. After Nurse Comstock took Rowley\u2019s blood, Officer Dexheimer gave the vials to Trooper King.\n\u00b612 On cross-examination, Officer Dexheimer explained that, according to his police report, hospital staff had washed the contents of the baggie down the sink before he arrived at Harborview. He stated that although Nurse Comstock found the baggie in the trash for him, he believed that a different staff member originally discovered the baggie. He also testified that he might have written the wrong date in his accident report and the wrong name on the blood vials (\u201cRawley\u201d instead of Rowley), CP at 765, that he did not test the baggie or take a sample from the hospital sink, and that coffee can raise a person\u2019s heart rate. CP at 766-67.\n\u00b613 Capron, the forensic specialist from the Lab, testified that the Lab received two vials of blood marked \u201cR-a-w-l-e-y,\u201d along with a \u201crequest for analysis\u201d marked \u201cR-o-w-l-e-y.\u201d CP at 784. He explained that the Lab\u2019s analysts noted that discrepancy and then tested the blood. Capron testified that the blood tested positive for high levels of methamphetamine. He also testified that he believed it was more probable than not that Rowley was impaired by methamphetamine when his truck went off the road.\n\u00b6 14 Compton, one of the ER nurses, testified that she did not specifically remember Rowley but that her records showed that Officer Dexheimer gave her vials so she could draw Rowley\u2019s blood.\n\u00b615 Comstock, the other ER nurse, testified that she remembered Rowley, but not well. She explained that when a trauma patient like Rowley comes into the ER, his or her clothing is cut off either before or upon arrival. She also stated that when ER staff cut clothing from a patient, they search it for valuables, lock up any valuables that are found, and dispose of any other items. Comstock said she was sure that Rowley\u2019s clothes were disposed of.\n\u00b616 Comstock also testified that Officer Dexheimer had disrupted protocol in the ER and that she had provided him with a baggie that she was certain, on that day, came from Rowley\u2019s clothes. She recounted the events as follows:\nI remember there being [a] disruptive scenario in that room, not because the patient was sick but because now we had the officer in-house. It was a . . . significant delay.\n... [W]e had done a lot of care and quantified the patient was very sick, but then this officer shows up and wants all of these things that we\u2019ve already disposed of and wants to be engaged in the care immediately [ ] regardless of the acuity. I do remember that part.\nSo I remember him wanting the clothes, being very frustrated about them not being readily available and being frustrated that we had found something that we suspected to be an illicit drug and that we didn\u2019t have to produce to him, and his expectation was that they would have saved all of this stuff, anticipating somebody to be there, but that\u2019s not our general practice.\nSo I do remember him and I - he and I dialoguing, and I told him I could find the clothes if they \u2014 I knew where they would go, because they had already been removed from the room, because the housekeepers are very diligent about cleaning those spaces.\nSo we went down the hall to where they would be and I do remember - I don\u2019t remember what trash they were in. I don\u2019t remember what the color of the bags were. I don\u2019t remember what the clothes looked like. I just remember us pulling the clothes out, me finding the ones that were his and the Baggie that he was in question about, because it was distinctive. . . .\n... I know that that day I was certain that they were [Rowley\u2019s clothes]. I couldn\u2019t recall to you at this point what they looked like or who they were [from], but they came from that room that was the only room that had just - they had just cleaned that day because I remember the housekeepers coming down to be helpful to, you know, help me go through the trash. That\u2019s not something they like for us to do at all, so it took significant negotiating to be able to get into the trash to be able to pull it out, because it\u2019s just not safe.\nCP at 905-07. Comstock also testified that she could not remember whether she or someone else originally discovered the baggie with the smiley faces on it. She explained that she had to go \u201cdown to the hallway ... to negotiate with the staff of the housekeepers to get into the room to be able to go through the trash, something they\u2019re instructed to not allow us to do.\u201d CP at 925-26.\n\u00b617 Trooper King testified that he came to Harborview shortly after Rowley\u2019s accident and that Officer Dexheimer provided him with two pieces of evidence there: the blood vials taken from Rowley and \u201ca small baggie of crystal substance.\u201d CP at 948. He stated that he labeled the blood vials with the name \u201c \u2018Rowley Bart A.,\u2019 \u201d Rowley\u2019s date of birth, and \u201citem numbers.\u201d CP at 948-49. He later clarified that he had marked the vials with the name \u201cR-A-W-L-E-Y,\u201d per Officer Dexheimer\u2019s original spelling, and testified that he used an incorrect \u201c[p]roperty number\u201d on the \u201ctransfer-disposition report\u201d associated with the vials and put the wrong \u201ctime obtained\u201d in his evidence report\u20142:30 a.m. instead of 2:30 p.m. CP at 953-56, 965. Trooper King also testified that he tested the residue in the baggie using a \u201cfield test kit\u201d or \u201cNIK [(narcotics identification kit)] test[ ]\u201d and determined it to be \u201cecstasy, methamphetamine.\u201d CP at 972-75, 948.\n\u00b618 Finally, Trooper Roberts testified that he was the first responder to the scene of Rowley\u2019s accident. He explained that the accident occurred in daylight, in dry weather, and on a portion of road with no signs or lights. Trooper Roberts stated that after his investigation, he recommended that the State charge Rowley with possessing methamphetamine in violation of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, chapter 69.50 RCW. But Trooper Roberts also testified that (1) he charged Rowley with DUI, (2) he referred the case to the prosecutor\u2019s office as a felony \u201cViolation of the Controlled Substance Act,\u201d and (3) he was not sure whether any criminal charges were ever filed against Rowley. CP at 1005-07. It is undisputed that the State never charged Rowley with a felony.\n\u00b619 On the basis of that testimony, Judge Stockman reversed the Department\u2019s order. In a \u201cProposed Decision and Order,\u201d she concluded that the Department had not met its burden\u2014which she determined to be a preponderance of the evidence standard\u2014to show that RCW 51.32.020\u2014as inaccurately paraphrased in the Department\u2019s original order\u2014barred compensation: \u201cInnuendos and boot strapping are not sufficient to establish even by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant\u2019s injury resulted from the deliberate intention of Mr. Rowley himself while he was engaged in the attempt to commit, or in the commission of, a felony.\u201d CP at 69. Judge Stockman therefore found that \u201c[o]n or about August 14, 2008, the injuries sustained by Bart A. Rowley, Sr., did not result from the deliberate intention of Mr. Rowley himself while he was engaged in the attempt to commit, or in the commission of, a felony.\u201d CP at 70.\nProcedural History\n\u00b620 A three-member panel of the Board granted the Department\u2019s petition for review. The Department argued that the IAJ erred by requiring it to prove that Rowley intended to commit a felony and by concluding that the preponderance of the evidence did not establish that Rowley possessed methamphetamine. The panel of the Board affirmed in a split vote, with three separate opinions applying three different evidentiary burdens. CP at 11-19.\n\u00b621 The controlling opinion (signed by two judges) reached four conclusions relevant to our analysis. CP at 11-17.\n\u00b622 First, the opinion addressed the confusion in the original and proposed orders regarding the legal standard at issue. It explained that compensation will be barred simply because a worker was injured while committing or attempting a felony, and that the Department does not need to prove any separate \u201c \u2018deliberate intention\u2019 \u201d in order to deny benefits. CP at 15 (emphasis omitted).\n\u00b623 Second, the opinion held that the Department must prove the commission or attempt of a felony by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. It acknowledged that the normal standard in IIA appeals is the preponderance of the evidence standard, but it concluded that felony payment bar appeals were different for two reasons: (1) the felony payment bar \u201cdeprive [s] the worker of benefits to which he or she would otherwise be entitled but for the allegation of wicked conduct\u201d and (2) an adverse determination exposes the worker to significant financial and reputational consequences and possibly even criminal prosecution. CP at 14. In reaching this conclusion, the controlling opinion also relied on a prior board decision interpreting another statute, RCW 51.32.240, which governs cases in which the Department alleges that a claimant obtained benefits through \u201cwillful misrepresentation.\u201d CP at 14-15.\n\u00b624 Third, the Board\u2019s controlling opinion concluded that the Department had not met its evidentiary burden. It explained that while the evidence showed that Rowley likely used methamphetamine, this was not dispositive because driving under the influence is only a gross misdemeanor. It further explained that while possession is a felony, the evidence that Rowley actually possessed methamphetamine in the truck was not clear, cogent, and convincing. It cited Officer Dexheimer\u2019s failure to explain why he believed the residue in the baggie was methamphetamine, the chain of custody problems involving the baggie, and Officer King\u2019s failure to explain why his field test was reliable or how that test could reveal both ecstasy and methamphetamine.\n\u00b625 Finally, the controlling opinion held that \u201cthe Department cannot reject a claim under the felony provision of RCW 51.32.020 [because] . . . [t]he proper inquiry [under that statute] is whether Rowley is barred from receiving industrial insurance payments.\u201d CP at 13. In other words, the panel issued a procedural holding: whenever the Department concludes that a claimant was injured in the course of employment while committing or attempting a felony, it must grant the claim and then deny payment.\n\u00b626 One member of the panel concurred in the decision, stating that he would have required the Department to prove the attempt or commission of a felony by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. CP at 17-18. The third member dissented, concluding that the preponderance of the evidence standard governs in all workers\u2019 compensation claims and that the Department\u2019s evidence met that standard. CP at 18-19.\n\u00b627 The Department appealed to the superior court. CP at 2-4. The superior court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision in all respects. CP at 1182-85. The Department again appealed. CP at 1186-87.\n\u00b628 Division One of the Court of Appeals affirmed two of the lower court\u2019s holdings: (1) the holding that the Department bears the burden to prove that the felony payment bar applies and (2) the holding that this proof must be by \u201cclear, cogent, and convincing\u201d evidence. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus. v. Rowley, 185 Wn. App. 154, 157, 340 P.3d 929 (2014), review granted, 183 Wn.2d 1007, 352 P.3d 187 (2015). But it reversed the holding that the Department cannot reject claims under the felony payment bar. Id. at 168-70.\n\u00b629 With respect to the burden of proof, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the felony payment bar is an affirmative defense: a statutory exception that the Department asserts to escape the general rule that a covered worker is entitled to benefits whenever he or she is injured on the job. Id. at 162.\n\u00b630 With respect to the standard of proof, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the preponderance standard usually applies in industrial insurance appeals. Id. at 163 (citing Olympia Brewing Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 34 Wn.2d 498, 504, 208 P.2d 1181 (1949), overruled in part on other grounds by Windust v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 52 Wn.2d 33, 40, 323 P.2d 241 (1958)). But it concluded that the Board\u2019s panel had made a sound \u201cpolicy decision\u201d to apply the clear, cogent, and convincing evidentiary standard in felony payment bar cases. Id. at 164-65. It decided that the superior court \u201cappropriately deferred to the expertise of the Board on this issue,\u201d in light of the purposes underlying the IIA. Id. at 165.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\u00b631 Generally, when we review an agency\u2019s decision, we sit in the same position as the superior court and apply the Administrative Procedure Act directly to the record before the agency. Brown v. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 184 Wn.2d 509, 359 P.3d 771 (2015); ch. 34.05 RCW. But a modified standard applies to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. Gorre v. City of Tacoma, 184 Wn.2d 30, 33, 357 P.3d 625 (2015). Under that standard, which is discussed in detail in the analysis below, the superior court presumes the correctness of the Board\u2019s decision and can reverse it only upon finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Board\u2019s \u201cfindings and decision are erroneous.\u201d Id. at 36 (citing Ravsten v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 108 Wn.2d 143, 146, 736 P.2d 265 (1987)).\n\u00b632 In an IIA appeal from the superior court, the court reviews the record \u201c \u2018to see whether substantial evidence supports the findings made after the superior court\u2019s de novo review, and whether the court\u2019s conclusions of law flow from the findings.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Ruse v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 138 Wn.2d 1, 5-6, 977 P.2d 570 (1999)). As always, we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo. Cockle v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 142 Wn.2d 801, 807, 16 P.3d 583 (2001).\nANALYSIS\n\u00b633 Three questions of law are presented in this case.\n\u00b634 The first is which party bears the burden of proof on the felony payment bar, RCW 51.32.020. On this question of first impression, the IIA is silent. For the reasons given in the analysis below, we hold that the Department bears this burden.\n\u00b635 The second question presented implicates the burden of production under RCW 51.52.050(2)(a), which provides:\nWhenever the department has taken any action or made any decision relating to any phase of the administration of this title the worker, beneficiary, employer, or other person aggrieved thereby may request reconsideration of the department, or may appeal to the board. In an appeal before the board, the appellant shall have the burden of proceeding with the evidence to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought in such appeal.\n\u00b636 The Department interprets this statute to mean that an aggrieved party must make some affirmative showing that an initial department order is incorrect. It contends this is a prerequisite to \u201cestablish [ing] a prima facie case for the relief sought in such appeal.\u201d Id.\n\u00b637 Rowley and amicus Washington State Association for Justice Foundation (WSAJF) disagree. They counter that a claimant establishes a \u201cprima facie case\u201d for relief on appeal just by presenting evidence that he or she was injured in the course of employment. Br. of Amicus WSAJF at 13; Suppl. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 8.\n\u00b638 For the reasons given in the analysis below, we conclude that in order to establish a \u201cprima facie case\u201d under RCW 51.52.050(2)(a), a party must make a viable case that a department decision is incorrect. However, we also conclude that a party can satisfy this requirement by showing (1) injury in the course of employment and (2) that the Department\u2019s order is unsupported by sufficient evidence.\n\u00b639 The third question presented is what evidentiary standard applies to the felony payment bar determination. The Court of Appeals upheld the Board\u2019s application of the \u201cclear, cogent, and convincing\u201d standard as a valid exercise of agency authority to \u201c \u2018fill[ ] in the gaps\u2019 to effect a general statutory scheme.\u201d Rowley, 185 Wn. App. at 164-65 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Hama Hama Co. v. Shoreline Hr\u2019gs Bd., 85 Wn.2d 441, 448, 536 P.2d 157 (1975)). Because we conclude that there is no statutory \u201cgap\u201d to be filled in this case, we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue and hold that the Department must prove commission or attempt of a felony only by a preponderance of the evidence.\nI. When the Department Denies Benefits under the Felony Payment Bar, It Bears the Burden of Proving the Commission or Attempt of a Felony\n\u00b640 No IIA provision expressly allocates the burden of proof on the felony payment bar, and no case law controls this issue. Thus, this case presents us with a question of first impression.\n\u00b641 As noted above, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Department bears the burden of proof on the felony payment bar because it characterized that bar as an affirmative defense to an otherwise meritorious benefits claim. Rowley, 185 Wn. App. at 162. That court reasoned that \u201c[p]roof that an industrial injury occurred during the commission of a felony does not negate any element of an industrial insurance claim.\u201d Id.\n\u00b642 Rowley argues that this analysis was correct. He contends that there are three \u201celement [s]\u201d of a prima facie benefits claim\u2014(1) injury (2) in the course of (3) employment\u2014and that commission of a felony does not negate any of these elements. Suppl. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 3-4 (emphasis omitted). The Department disagrees. It contends that the Court of Appeals created an arbitrary and confusing distinction between necessary and unnecessary \u201celements\u201d of a worker\u2019s compensation claim. Suppl. Br. of Pet\u2019r at 14.\n\u00b643 We agree with the Department that the affirmative defense analogy is inapt. As Rowley acknowledges, an affirmative defense generally excuses a violation without negating an element of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Kastanis v. Educ. Emps. Credit Union, 122 Wn.2d 483, 493, 859 P.2d 26, 865 P.2d 507 (1993). But Rowley argues that the \u201celements\u201d of a claim under RCW 51.52.050(2)(a) are (1) injury (2) in the course of (3) employment. Suppl. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 1. The felony payment bar arguably negates the second element: injury while committing a felony is not injury in the course of employment.\n\u00b644 Indeed, in order to show that he or she is entitled to benefits, a worker must sometimes negate the deliberate self-injury bar codified at RCW 51.32.020. Mercer v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 74 Wn.2d 96, 101, 442 P.2d 1000 (1968). In Mercer, the widow of a logger filed a claim for benefits, arguing that a hand injury her husband sustained in the course of his employment caused him to commit suicide six months later. Id. at 97-98. The Department denied the claim under the deliberate self-injury bar, and this court affirmed, reasoning that the plaintiff had not \u201cma[de] out a prima facie case\u201d (for entitlement to benefits/relief on appeal). Id. at 101. Specifically, it held that \u201c[i]n cases such as this, in view of the statutory language precluding recovery if the workman\u2019s death results from his own deliberate intention to take his life, we have allowed recovery only where [the claimant presents] competent medical evidence establish [ing] that the decedent acted under an incontrol-lable impulse or while in a delirium.\u201d Id. (emphasis added) (citation omitted) (citing Karlen v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 41 Wn.2d 301, 249 P.2d 364 (1952)).\n\u00b645 The Department contends that we apply this rule because the deliberate self-injury bar breaks the chain \u201c \u2018between cause and a proximately related result\u2019 \u201d and thus \u201cnegates an element of the cause of action\u201d (injury in the course of employment). Suppl. Br. of Pet\u2019r at 14 (quoting Schwab v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 76 Wn.2d 784, 791-92, 459 P.2d 1 (1969)). Our older cases appear to support this argument. See Arsnow v. Red Top Cab Co., 159 Wash. 137, 159, 292 P. 436 (1930) (in both common law tort and industrial insurance claims, claimant must prove that a suicide was \u201cmoved by an uncontrollable impulse\u201d in order to show that it did not break the chain of causation between employment and death). We decline to overrule Mercer and must therefore reject the Court of Appeals\u2019 \u201caffirmative defense\u201d analysis.\n\u00b646 Although we reject the Court of Appeals\u2019 affirmative defense analysis, we affirm its holding that the Department bears the burden to prove that the felony payment bar applies. Common sense and policy concerns may dictate the allocation of the burden of persuasion in a civil case. 5 Karl B. Tegland, Washington Practice: Evidence Law and Practice \u00a7 301.2, at 193 (5th ed. 2007) (where preponderance standard applies, \u201c[t] rial convenience, access to facts, and substantive policy are all factors for consideration, but for the most part the burden of persuasion must be determined on a case-by-case basis\u201d). Common sense dictates that a worker should not be required to prove a negative\u2014noncommission of a felony\u2014in order to obtain benefits under the IIA. Indeed, in this case the Department\u2019s order denying benefits did not even mention what the alleged felony was. A worker should not be required to rebut, with positive evidence and before any hearing occurs, the Department\u2019s bare assertion that he or she has committed a felony. We do not interpret the IIA to impose such a burden.\n\u00b647 A contrary conclusion would require courts to presume the commission or attempt of a felony, a presumption that would offend basic principles of judicial fairness. Consistent with these principles of fairness, and absent any clear statutory directive, we hold that the legislature intended to burden the Department with proving that a felony bars payment under RCW 51.32.020.\nII. To Establish a \u201cPrima Facie Case for the Relief Sought\u201d in an Appeal under RCW 51.52.050(2)(a), a Worker Must Show That the Department\u2019s Order Was Incorrect, but a Worker Can Meet This Requirement by Showing (1) Injury in the Course of Employment and (2) That the Department\u2019s Order Is Not Supported by Sufficient Evidence\n\u00b648 The second question presented in this case is also one of first impression for this court. It requires us to interpret RCW 51.52.050(2)(a), the statute requiring the appellant in \u201can appeal before the [B]oard . . . [to] proceed! ] with the evidence to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought in such appeal.\u201d As noted above, the Department interprets this statute to mean that an aggrieved party must make some affirmative showing that an initial Department order is incorrect.\n\u00b649 We agree that in order to establish a \u201cprima facie case\u201d under RCW 51.52.050(2)(a), a party must show that a department decision is incorrect. However, we also conclude that a party can satisfy this requirement by showing (1) injury in the course of employment and (2) that the Department\u2019s order is unsupported by sufficient evidence.\n\u00b650 This is the only viable interpretation of RCW 51.52-.050(2)(a) for two reasons.\n\u00b651 First, a contrary holding would shift the burden of proof on the felony payment bar, requiring an aggrieved worker to provide evidence of noncommission of a felony even before any formal hearing occurred. (Although RCW 51.52-.050(2)(a) permits an \u201cappeal to the board,\u201d an \u201cappeal\u201d from a department order is in fact the first proceeding at which any evidence is taken.) As explained above, this result would be inconsistent with basic principles of fairness.\n\u00b652 Second, the Department\u2019s interpretation of RCW 51.52.050(2)(a) does not comport with cases interpreting RCW 51.52.115, the statute that governs IIA appeals from the Board to the superior court. RCW 51.52.115 provides that \u201c[i]n all court proceedings under or pursuant to this title the findings and decision of the board shall be prima facie correct and the burden of proof shall be upon the party attacking the same.\u201d The plain terms of this statute place a greater burden on the appellant than RCW 51.52.050(2)(a), the statute at issue in this case. RCW 51.52.115 provides that the Board\u2019s decision is presumed correct on appeal; RCW 51.52.050(2)(a) contains no such provision. And while RCW 51.52.050(2)(a) provides that the appellant bears only the burden to come forward with a \u201cprima facie case for the relief sought\u201d on appeal, RCW 51.52.115 places the \u201cburden of proof\u201d squarely on the appellant. Nevertheless, this court has held that an appellant can meet the burden imposed under RCW 51.52.115 just by showing that the Department\u2019s order is not supported by sufficient evidence\u2014that is, without necessarily presenting any new affirmative evidence that the Department\u2019s order is incorrect. Olympia Brewing, 34 Wn.2d at 506. Given the difference in language summarized above, RCW 51.52.050(2)(a) cannot possibly impose a greater evidentiary burden on an aggrieved party.\n\u00b653 For all of these reasons, we hold that a worker challenging an order from the Department that denies benefits under the felony payment bar establishes a \u201cprima facie case for the relief sought on appeal\u201d under RCW 51.52.050(2)(a) by showing (1) injury in the course of employment and (2) that there is insufficient evidence that the felony payment bar applies.\nIII. The Court of Appeals Erred by Requiring the Department To Prove the Commission or Attempt of a Felony by Clear, Cogent, and Convincing Evidence; the Correct Standard Is a Preponderance\n\u00b654 With respect to the evidentiary standard, Rowley repeats the analysis in the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion. He contends that the Board\u2019s \u201cpolicy decision\u201d is owed \u201c \u2018great weight\u2019 \u201d because it filled a \u201cgap\u201d in the statute the Board is charged with implementing. Suppl. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 9 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Rowley, 185 Wn. App. at 165 & n.25 (citing Hama Hama, 85 Wn.2d at 448)). While we recognize that an agency is entitled to some deference when it interprets an ambiguous statute it is charged with implementing (when it \u201c \u2018fill [s] in the gaps\u2019 via statutory construction\u201d), Hama Hama, 85 Wn.2d at 448, we find no gaps or ambiguity justifying the Board\u2019s interpretation in this case.\n\u00b655 Indeed, the Court of Appeals did not identify a statutory gap in this case; it identified what it perceived as a gap in civil case law. The IIA provision governing rules on appeal provides that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this chapter, the practice in civil cases shall apply to appeals prescribed in this chapter.\u201d RCW 51.52.140. And as the Department points out, the preponderance of the evidence standard generally applies in civil cases. Suppl. Br. of Pet\u2019r at 15. Instead of acknowledging that general rule of civil case law, the Court of Appeals determined that \u201c[n]o general principle or fixed rule exists [in civil case law] for deciding when to require more than a preponderance of the evidence to prove something.\u201d Rowley, 185 Wn. App. at 163-64. Then, citing one treatise, one case addressing procedural due process claims, and one case addressing parental rights, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201cWashington courts have required proof of facts by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in over 30 different types of cases,\u201d and that \u201cwhen these cases do not involve the loss of liberty or deprivation of a property interest, they reflect a policy decision.\u201d Id. at 164 (citing Nguyen v. Med. Quality Assur. Comm\u2019n, 144 Wn.2d 516, 524-25, 29 P.3d 689 (2001) (quoting Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 424, 99 S. Ct. 1804, 60 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1979))); Am. Prods. Co. v. Villwock, 7 Wn.2d 246, 268, 109 P.2d 570 (1941); 5 Tegland, supra, \u00a7 301.3, at 200-06 & nn.5-41.\n\u00b656 We disagree. No case cited by the Court of Appeals, or collected in the treatise it cited, applies the \u201cclear, cogent and convincing\u201d standard to proof of a felony in a civil case. Rowley, 185 Wn. App. at 164. Most of them apply the long-standing common law rule that clear and convincing evidence is required to alter or invalidate a written contract. Several more apply a heightened evidentiary standard as a matter of statutory law. And the rest apply it because it is constitutionally required (an argument that Rowley did not raise in this court).\n\u00b657 Even if these cases could be said to derive from varying \u201cpolicy\u201d concerns, Rowley, 185 Wn. App. at 164, these are policy concerns that the courts\u2014not the Board\u2014 are empowered to address. The Board is required to apply a particular statute, and that statute says that \u201cthe practice in civil cases\u201d shall apply to IIA appeals, RCW 51.52.140. Civil practice in our state has required proof of a felony by a preponderance\u2014not by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. See, e.g., In re Estate of Kissinger, 166 Wn.2d 120, 128, 206 P.3d 665 (2009).\n\u00b658 As noted above and in the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, the Board panel applied the clear, cogent, and convincing evidentiary standard in part because that standard applies to the Department\u2019s allegations of \u201c \u2018willful misrepresentation\u2019 \u201d in benefit-recoupment cases. Rowley, 185 Wn. App. at 164-65 (quoting In re Rowley, No. 09 12323, 2012 WL 1374566, at *4, 2012 WA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 2, at *9-10 (Wash. Bd. Indus. Ins. Appeals Jan. 30, 2012)). In this case, the panel decided that the same standard should apply when the Department seeks to prove commission of a felony, in light of the severe consequences that could follow. CP at 4.\n\u00b659 But the Board\u2019s application of the heightened standard in willful misrepresentation cases does not reflect a policy decision to depart from general civil practice. Instead, it reflects a decision to adhere to long-standing rules of civil practice, despite recent amendments to the IIA. When the legislature enacted the \u201cwillful misrepresentation\u201d statute, RCW 51.32.240(5), in 2004, it replaced an older statute that required the Department to prove that benefits were \u201cfraudulently obtained.\u201d In re Hejna, No. 04 24184, 2006 WL 3520132, at *7, 2006 WA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 140, at *19 (Wash. Bd. Indus. Ins. Appeals Aug. 28, 2006); Laws of 2004, ch. 243, \u00a7 7. Consistent with the rule that civil practice governs in IIA appeals, the Board interpreted the old statute to incorporate the common law rule that \u201cfraud required proof by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.\u201d Hejna, 2006 WL 3520132, at *8, 2006 WA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 140, at *21. When the Board first interpreted the amended (willful misrepresentation) statute, it concluded that the legislature did not intend to alter that long-standing (common-law-derived) burden. 2006 WL 3520132, at *8, 2006 WA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 140, at *21. Thus, applying the common law preponderance standard in felony payment bar cases is actually consistent with the Board\u2019s decisions in willful misrepresentation cases.\nIV. The Evidence in This Case Is Insufficient To Sustain a Finding That Rowley Committed a Felony\n\u00b660 For the reasons given above, the Department bears the burden of proving the applicability of the felony payment bar by a preponderance of the evidence. The next question is whether it has satisfied that burden.\n\u00b661 The answer is no. As the Department acknowledges, DUI is not a felony. The only felonious conduct alleged in this case is possession of a controlled substance. In the criminal context, evidence of intoxication may support a finding of prior possession, but only when it is combined with other corroborating evidence of sufficient probative value. See State v. Dalton, 72 Wn. App. 674, 677, 865 P.2d 575 (1994) (evidence of intoxication was sufficient, in combination with defendant\u2019s \u201cclose proximity to a beer keg and plastic cups of beer,\u201d to sustain conviction for minor in possession of liquor).\n\u00b662 But that is all we have here. As Judge Stockman recognized at the initial hearing, the nurses who treated Rowley in the ER testified that they could not remember if he had clothes on when he arrived; that they could not remember what his clothes looked like; and that ER staff make no effort to keep track of nonvaluable items removed from a patient. Further, a baggie from which alleged methamphetamine had been dumped in the sink was arguably recovered from a trash bag in a room down the hall from where Rowley was being treated, by someone other than whoever supposedly found it in Rowley\u2019s pocket, and it was field tested and determined to contain residue of \u201cecstasy or methamphetamine.\u201d CP at 974 (emphasis added). We agree that this evidence does not establish, even by a preponderance, that Rowley possessed methamphetamine when his truck left the highway.\n\u00b663 Because we hold that the evidence of possession was insufficient as a matter of law, we do not remand to the trial court to reweigh the evidence. See Olympia Brewing, 34 Wn.2d at 507 (when appellate court is faced with \u201cfailure of proof\u201d in workers\u2019 compensation claim, the appropriate disposition is \u201creversal, with a direction to deny the claim\u201d).\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b664 We affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that the Department bears the burden of proving that the felony payment bar applies. Because the Department bears this burden, an aggrieved worker establishes a \u201cprima facie case for the relief sought\u201d in an appeal under RCW 51.52-.050(2)(a) if he or she can show that the preponderance of the evidence does not establish the commission or attempt of a felony.\n\u00b665 We reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that the Department must prove the applicability of the felony payment bar by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence and hold that the correct evidentiary standard is a preponderance. But we also hold that the evidence in this case was insufficient to establish commission of a felony under that standard. Accordingly, we hold that Rowley is entitled to benefits.\nJohnson, Owens, Stephens, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Yu, JJ., and Ellington, J. Pro Tem., concur.\nRowley\u2019s spinal cord was severed in the accident, causing paraplegia, among other conditions.\nThe only exception to this rule applies to cases in which the Department alleges that a worker has received benefits through \u201cfraud or willful misrepresentation.\u2019\u2019 WAC 263-12-115(2)(a).\nThe Department also cites RCW 51.52.050(2)(c), which provides that \u201c[i]n an appeal from an order of the department that alleges willful misrepresentation, the department or self-insured employer shall initially introduce all evidence in its case in chief.\u201d It argues that this statute proves, by logical extension, that \u201cthe Legislature intended to hold an appealing worker to the burden of proof in all cases except when the Department alleges benefits were received through willful misrepresentation.\u201d Suppl. Br. of Pet\u2019r at 8. We reject this argument. RCW 51.52.050(2)(c) addresses only the order of proof, as opposed to the burden of proof. Accordingly, the rule that implements that provision is titled \u201cOrder of presentation of evidence.\u201d WAC 263-12-115(2).\nThe Court of Appeals concluded that because the parties in Mercer, 74 Wn.2d at 101, did not dispute the decedent\u2019s suicide, the Mercer court properly allocated the burden of proof to the claimant\u2014the party who \u201casserted ... an exception to the suicide bar I Rowley, 185 Wn. App. at 166. The Court of Appeals explained that this was \u201c[c]onsistent with our analysis,\u2019\u2019 id., according to which \u201cone asserting the benefits of a general limitation of a statute has the burden of proof,\u2019\u2019 id. at 163 (citing Stafford v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 33 Wn. App. 231, 236, 653 P.2d 1350 (1982)). This reasoning ignores the plain language of the RCW 51.32.020, which does not bar payments in the event of a suicide, but in the event of \u201cdeliberate\" self-injury. (Emphasis added.) Thus, by invoking the self-injury bar, the Department alleges deliberate self-injury (not suicide).\nSee City of Boston v. Lecraw, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 426, 435, 15 L. Ed. 118 (1854) (because \u201c The law will not presume any man\u2019s acts to be illegal,\u2019 \u201d courts \u201cwill ascribe long possession which cannot otherwise be accounted for, to a legal title\u2019\u2019 (quoting 3 Thomas Starkie, A Practical Treatise on the Law of Evidence 1203 (3d ed. 1830))); Ricard v. Williams, 20 U.S. (7 Wheat) 59, 106, 5 L. Ed. 398 (1822) (\u201cthe law will not presume a wrong\u2019\u2019); Hall v. Anderson, 18 Wn.2d 625, 636, 140 P.2d 266 (1943) (\u201c \u2018[t]he law will not presume, unless forced to do so, that a person intends to do an illegal act[, and] [i]t will not, therefore, presume that the parties intended to make an illegal contract\u2019 \u2019\u2019 (quoting Richards v. Ernst Wiener Co., 207 N.Y. 59, 65, 100 N.E. 592 (1912))); Stevenson v. Woodhull Bros., 19 F. 575, 576 (W.D. Texas 1884) (\u201c[t]he law will not presume that an act that may lawfully be done was unlawful in the absence of proof\u2019\u2019).\nIn Olympia Brewing, the Department approved a widow-claimant\u2019s application for benefits solely on the ground that her husband was found unconscious at work and died shortly thereafter. 34 Wn.2d at 499-500. The employer appealed, and a board hearing occurred at which only the employer presented any evidence. Id. at 500. This evidence established that the worker had a heart condition, but did not establish any causal connection between his work and his death. Id. at 502. Nevertheless, the Board affirmed the grant of benefits. Id. at 500. The employer appealed, and the superior court affirmed. Id.\nOn appeal to this court, the Olympia Brewing claimant made an argument very similar to the Department\u2019s argument in this case, i.e., that her failure of evidence was \u201cimmaterial\u201d in light of the Board\u2019s final decision:\nThe respondents make another contention, i.e., that the fact that no causal relationship has been established between the death and the employment is immaterial, because the joint board determined that Mrs. Smith was entitled to a widow\u2019s pension . . . and that determination is prima facie correct and must prevail unless and until the employer sustains the burden of proving that she is not so entitled.\nId. at 504 (underline added). This court rejected that argument and reversed the grant of benefits, holding that \u201cone sustains the burden of proving that a decision of the joint board is erroneous when one demonstrates that there is not sufficient evidence to support it.\" Id.

        "text": "Madsen, C.J.\n\u00b666 (concurring) I agree with much of what the majority holds. I agree that in an appeal of a Department of Labor and Industries (Department) decision denying benefits, the party appealing has the burden of production to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought, and that in the present case, this requires the claimant to make a viable case that the Department\u2019s decision is incorrect. I agree that the appropriate standard of proof in the present case is a preponderance of the evidence. I also agree that the evidence here is insufficient to show that Bart Rowley Sr. committed a felony for purposes of applying the felony payment bar contained in RCW 51.32.020 (discussed infra). Accordingly, I agree that Rowley is entitled to benefits. In my view, however, the claimant seeking benefit payments, not the Department, bears the burden of proof to show the absence of a felony that would bar benefit payments under RCW 51.32.020.\nDiscussion\n\u00b667 RCW 51.32.020 provides in part,\nIf injury or death results to a worker from the deliberate intention of the worker himself or herself to produce such injury or death, or while the worker is engaged in the attempt to commit, or the commission of, a felony, neither the worker nor the widow, widower, child, or dependent of the worker shall receive any payment under this title.\n(Emphasis added.) Noting the \u201cabsentee of] any clear statutory directive\u201d and instead relying on \u201cprinciples of fairness,\u201d the majority holds that \u201cthe legislature intended to burden the Department with proving that a felony bars payment under RCW 51.32.020.\u201d Majority at 205. In my view, that approach is at odds with the general scheme of the Industrial Insurance Act (IIA), Title 51 RCW, as explained in our case law interpreting the IIA. We long ago held that \u201cwhile the act should be liberally construed in favor of those who come within its terms, persons who claim rights thereunder should be held to strict proof of their right to receive the benefits provided by the act.\u201d Olympia Brewing Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 34 Wn.2d 498, 505, 208 P.2d 1181 (1949), overruled on other grounds by Windust v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 52 Wn.2d 33, 323 P.2d 241 (1958).\n\u00b668 The majority reasons that \u201ca worker should not be required to prove a negative\u2014noncommission of a felony\u2014in order to obtain benefits under the IIA.\u201d Majority at 205. But we have previously interpreted the intentional injury portion of RCW 51.32.020 to place just such a burden on the claimant. In Mercer v. Department of Labor & Industries, we explained:\n[I]n view of the statutory language [in RCW 51.32.020] precluding recovery if the workman\u2019s death results from his own deliberate intention to take his life, we have allowed recovery only where [the claimant presents] competent medical evidence establish [ing] that the decedent acted under an incontrollable impulse or while in a delirium.\n74 Wn.2d 96, 101, 442 P.2d 1000 (1968) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). In other words, in Mercer, applying RCW 51.32.020, we imposed the requirement that the claimant must prove a negative\u2014that the deceased\u2019s taking his own life was not the result of his deliberate intentional act. I see no reason why we should retreat from imposing the same requirement when applying another portion of the same statute in the present case. While the majority maintains that requiring the claimant here to \u201cprove a negative\u201d is unfair, majority at 205, we have already imposed that burden in the even more difficult context of a person who is deceased. See Mercer, 74 Wn.2d at 101. Indeed, placing the burden on the claimant here would promote uniformity and predictability in application of the IIA.\n\u00b669 The majority contends that \u201c[c]ommon sense dictates\u201d that the burden be placed on the Department here. Majority at 205. But again, the approach that comports with our case law \u201cdictates\u201d that the burden here, which concerns the claimant\u2019s establishing his right to benefits, should be borne by the claimant. See, e.g., Knight v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 181 Wn. App. 788, 795-96, 321 P.3d 1275 (in a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the injured worker bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to benefits), review denied, 181 Wn.2d 1023 (2014); Robinson v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 181 Wn. App. 415, 426, 326 P.3d 744 (workers\u2019 compensation claimant bears the burden of establishing eligibility for benefits), review denied, 181 Wn.2d 1017 (2014). Again, the general scheme of the IIA argues in favor of placing the burden here on the claimant rather than the department. For instance, RCW 51.52-.050(2)(a) provides:\nWhenever the department has taken any action or made any decision relating to any phase of the administration of this title the worker, beneficiary, employer, or other person aggrieved thereby may request reconsideration of the department, or may appeal to the board. In an appeal before the board, the appellant shall have the burden of proceeding with the evidence to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought in such appeal.\n(Emphasis added); see also Zoff v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 174 Wash. 585, 586, 25 P.2d 972 (1933) (\u201cThe decision of the department was prima facie correct, and the burden was upon the one attacking that decision to overcome the same by evidence.\u201d); Hastings v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 24 Wn.2d 1, 5, 163 P.2d 142 (1945) (\u201cThe first rule is that the decision of the department is prima facie correct and the burden of proof is upon the party attacking the decision.\u201d).\n\u00b670 As noted, we have long held that the burden of establishing eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation benefits lies with the claimant. See Kirk v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 192 Wash. 671, 674, 74 P.2d 227 (1937) (\u201c \u2018Persons entitled to the benefits of the act should be favored by a liberal interpretation of its provisions, but for this very reason they should be held to strict proof of their title as beneficiaries.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Harris v. Okla. Nat. Gas Co., 1923 OK 311, 91 Okla. 39, 42, 216 P. 116)); Guiles v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 13 Wn.2d 605, 610, 126 P.2d 195 (1942) (\u201cWe are mindful of the rule that the burden rests on claimant to prove every element of his claim by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d); Cyr v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 47 Wn.2d 92, 97, 286 P.2d 1038 (1955) (\u201c \u2018persons who claim rights [under the IIA] should be held to strict proof of their right to receive the benefits provided by the act\u2019 \u201d (quoting Olympia Brewing, 34 Wn.2d at 505)); Lightle v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 68 Wn.2d 507, 510, 413 P.2d 814 (1966) (\u201cWe have held that a liberal construction of the act does not dispose of the requirement that a claimant must prove his claim by competent evidence.\u201d). As can be seen, in matters concerning eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, absent a specific exception, the burden of proof has consistently been placed on the claimant asserting the right to such benefits. I would not alter application of that burden in the present case.\nFairhurst, J., concurs with Madsen, C.J.\nSee also Gatterdam v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 185 Wash. 628, 635, 56 P.2d 693 (1936) (approving jury instructions (1) that placed burden on claimant to prove that deceased worker\u2019s death by suicide was the result of insanity, which was caused by industrial injury, and (2) that directed that \u201cunless the death of [worker] was the result of an uncontrollable impulse, in no way directed by the mind, then the plaintiff [claimant] cannot recover\u2019\u2019).\nSee RCW 51.52.050(2)(c), which provides:\nIn an appeal from an order of the department that alleges willful misrepresentation, the department or self-insured employer shall initially introduce all evidence in its case in chief. Any such person aggrieved by the decision and order of the board may thereafter appeal to the superior court, as prescribed in this chapter.\n(Emphasis added.)",

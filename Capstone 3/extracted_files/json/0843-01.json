        "text": "Yu, J.\n\u00b61 Are ordinary wire cutters \u201cdesigned to overcome security systems\u201d within the context of retail theft? To answer this question, we must interpret the statutory language of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b), which elevates retail theft to a more serious offense when the defendant is in possession of \u201can item, article, implement, or device designed to overcome security systems.\u201d\n\u00b62 We hold that the plain language of RCW 9A.56-.360(1)(b) establishes the legislature\u2019s intent to target organized retail theft only where particular types of tools are utilized. An item, article, implement, or device is \u201cdesigned to overcome security systems\u201d if it is created\u2014whether by the manufacturer or the defendant\u2014with the specific purpose of disabling or evading security systems. Because we hold that ordinary, unmodified wire cutters do not fall within this definition, the evidence is insufficient to support petitioner Zachary Larson\u2019s conviction for retail theft with \u201cextenuating\u201d circumstances. We reverse the Court of Appeals.\nBackground\n\u00b63 Under former RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b), a person commits retail theft with \u201cextenuating\u201d circumstances when he or she \u201cwas, at the time of the theft, in possession of an item, article, implement, or device designed to overcome security systems including, but not limited to, lined bags or tag removers.\u201d Petitioner Zachary Larson was convicted under the statute for committing retail theft while in possession of wire cutters. He used the wire cutters to remove a security tag from a pair of Nike shoes worth $32 at a Marshalls store in Bellingham. The State elected to charge Larson under this statutory provision rather than the ordinary theft statute. Larson contends, as a matter of law, that wire cutters do not constitute a device \u201cdesigned to overcome security systems\u201d as required by the statute and, therefore, the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction for retail theft with \u201cextenuating\u201d circumstances.\n\u00b64 The Court of Appeals has addressed the question of what the legislature intended by \u201cdesigned to overcome security systems\u201d in two conflicting opinions. In the case below, Division One affirmed Larson\u2019s conviction in a split decision. State v. Larson, 185 Wn. App. 903, 344 P.3d 244 (2015). Interpreting \u201cdesigned\u201d to include the item itself as well as the objective to which the item is put to use, Division One reasoned that because wire cutters are designed to cut wire and wires are used in security systems, wire cutters fall within the scope of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b). Under Division One\u2019s sweeping logic, the statute encompasses any item that can be used to overcome a security system.\n\u00b65 Division One explicitly rejected Larson\u2019s argument that the statute is limited to devices created with the specific purpose of overcoming security systems, and recognized that its decision was in direct conflict with a decision by Division Two. Id. at 910-11. In State v. Reeves, 184 Wn. App. 154, 157, 336 P.3d 105 (2014), Division Two held that \u201cordinary pliers\u201d did not fall within the scope of RCW 9A.56.360(l)(b). Although Division Two ultimately relied on the rule of lenity to construe the statute in Reeves\u2019 favor, the court found that principles of statutory construction and the legislative history supported interpreting the statute \u201cas applying only to devices made specifically for the purpose of overcoming security systems and not to ordinary devices a defendant intends to use to facilitate retail theft.\u201d Id. at 162.\n\u00b66 We accepted review to resolve this conflict within the Court of Appeals between Division One and Division Two as to the meaning and scope of the phrase \u201cdesigned to overcome security systems.\u201d\nAnalysis\nA. Interpreting the Scope of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b)\n\u00b67 Whenever we are tasked with interpreting the meaning and scope of a statute, \u201cour fundamental objective is to determine and give effect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d State v. Sweany, 174 Wn.2d 909, 914, 281 P.3d 305 (2012) (citing State v. Budik, 173 Wn.2d 727, 733, 272 P.3d 816 (2012)). We look first to the plain language of the statute as \u201c[t]he surest indication of legislative intent.\u201d State v. Ervin, 169 Wn.2d 815, 820, 239 P.3d 354 (2010). \u201c \u2018[I]f the statute\u2019s meaning is plain on its face, then the court must give effect to that plain meaning as an expression of legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d State v. Hirschfelder, 170 Wn.2d 536, 543, 242 P.3d 876 (2010) (quoting Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 9-10, 43 P.3d 4 (2002)). We may determine a statute\u2019s plain language by looking to \u201cthe text of the statutory provision in question, as well as \u2018the context of the statute in which that provision is found, related provisions, and the statutory scheme as a whole.\u2019 \u201d Ervin, 169 Wn.2d at 820 (quoting State v. Jacobs, 154 Wn.2d 596, 600, 115 P.3d 281 (2005)).\n\u00b68 Former RCW 9A.56.360 elevates retail theft to a more serious offense under certain circumstances:\n(1)A person commits retail theft with extenuating circumstances if he or she commits theft of property from a mercantile establishment with one of the following extenuating circumstances:\n(b) The person was, at the time of the theft, in possession of an item, article, implement, or device designed, to overcome security systems including, but not limited to, lined bags or tag removers.\n(Emphasis added.) \u201cDesigned to overcome security systems\u201d is not defined in the statute, but a plain language analysis leads us to conclude that the legislature did not intend to include ordinary wire cutters within the scope of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b).\n\u00b69 We look first to the surrounding statutory language to determine the legislature\u2019s intended meaning and scope. See Burns v. City of Seattle, 161 Wn.2d 129, 148, 164 P.3d 475 (2007) (\u201ca doubtful term or phrase in a statute or ordinance takes its meaning from associated words and phrases\u201d (describing the principle of noscitur a sociis) (citing State v. Rice, 120 Wn.2d 549, 560-61, 844 P.2d 416 (1993))). Specifically, we turn to the illustrative examples of lined bags and tag removers to determine what the legislature intended by \u201cdesigned to overcome security systems.\u201d\n\u00b610 The State correctly observes that the statute, by its own terms, is not limited to the examples provided by the legislature. The statutory language \u201cincluding, but not limited to\u201d plainly establishes lined bags and tag removers as illustrative examples rather than an exhaustive list. Cf. In re Postsentence Review of Leach, 161 Wn.2d 180, 186, 163 P.3d 782 (2007) (lack of a provision for \u201csimilar\u201d or \u201clike\u201d offenses indicated that \u201cthe legislature plainly meant for these enumerated crimes to be the exclusive and complete list\u201d). However, contrary to the State\u2019s assertions, the plain language of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b) indicates that the illustrative examples were intended to limit the scope of the statute. We apply the principle of statutory interpretation that \u201cgeneral terms, when used in conjunction with specific terms in a statute, should be deemed only to incorporate those things similar in nature or \u2018comparable to\u2019 the specific terms.\u201d Simpson Inv. Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 141 Wn.2d 139, 151, 3 P.3d 741 (2000) (quoting John H. Sellen Constr. Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 87 Wn.2d 878, 883-84, 558 P.2d 1342 (1976)); see also State v. Gonzales Flores, 164 Wn.2d 1, 13, 186 P.3d 1038 (2008) (\u201cspecific words modify and restrict the meaning of general words when they occur in a sequence\u201d (describing the principle of ejusdem generis) (citing State v. Roadhs, 71 Wn.2d 705, 708, 430 P.2d 586 (1967))). Extrapolating from the two illustrative examples of lined bags and tag removers, we can determine that the legislature intended to limit the scope of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b) to similar items.\n\u00b611 The statute does not define lined bags or tag removers, but a commonsense examination of these examples provides insight into the statute\u2019s intended meaning and scope. Lined bags are an example of an article created by a thief for the specific purpose of committing retail theft. Also known as \u201cbooster bags,\u201d these are typically bags lined with layers of tinfoil. See Cenatis v. State, 120 So. 3d 41, 42 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2013). A lined bag overcomes a security system by preventing detection of the security device by security scanners when the thief exits the store. Id. As its name states, the sole purpose of a tag remover is to remove security tags from merchandise. The intended, lawful purpose is for retail employees to remove tags from merchandise after the customer has purchased it. But in the hands of a thief, the tag removers become a highly effective tool for overcoming a store\u2019s security system. Lined bags and tag removers are highly specialized tools with little to no utility outside of the commission of retail theft. From this fact, it can be reasonably inferred that there is no reason a person would be in possession of these items except to facilitate retail theft.\n\u00b612 We disagree with the State\u2019s contention that the legislature intended to capture a significantly broader class of items beyond the examples expressly provided in the statute. The State\u2019s overly broad interpretation is inconsistent with the well-established principle that statutes must be interpreted \u201c \u2018so that all the language used is given effect, with no portion rendered meaningless or superfluous.\u2019 \u201d State v. J.P., 149 Wn.2d 444, 450, 69 P.3d 318 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Davis v. Dep\u2019t of Licensing, 137 Wn.2d 957, 963, 977 P.2d 554 (1999)). If the statute were to encompass any device that could be used to overcome a security system, as the State contends, the examples enumerated by the legislature would be superfluous and provide no additional guidance on the application of the statute. In order to give meaning and effect to the examples the legislature chose to provide, we must interpret them as instructive examples that demonstrate the type and character of items that are included within the scope of the statute. Thus, we can reasonably infer that the examples were intended to limit the scope to similar items, rather than expand the scope to any item that could conceivably be used to overcome security systems.\n\u00b613 Furthermore, we must interpret statutes to avoid absurd results. State v. Alvarado, 164 Wn.2d 556, 562, 192 P.3d 345 (2008) (citing Tingey v. Haisch, 159 Wn.2d 652, 664, 152 P.3d 1020 (2007)). Under the State\u2019s interpretation, virtually any shoplifting offense could fall within the scope of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b). For example, where a person slips a stolen item into his pocket to hide it from a store\u2019s security camera, the pocket has arguably become a \u201cdevice designed to overcome security systems.\u201d Similarly, a person who happens to have in her pocket a pair of nail clippers, a Leatherman multitool, or any other tool that people commonly carry with them, at the time she shoplifts would be guilty of retail theft with \u201cextenuating\u201d circumstances. As these practical examples demonstrate, the State\u2019s over-inclusive approach belies the statute\u2019s primary purpose of capturing retail theft that occurs under certain aggravating circumstances.\n\u00b614 We also cannot agree with the State\u2019s assertion that the statute was intended to include items \u201cthat can be used to steal in a variety of retail theft settings.\u201d Resp\u2019t\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 10 (emphasis added). By treating \u201cdesigned\u201d as synonymous with \u201cused,\u201d the State\u2019s interpretation reads words into the statute that simply are not there. It is beyond our power and function to \u201c \u2018add words or clauses to an unambiguous statute when the legislature has chosen not to include that language.\u2019 \u201d J.P., 149 Wn.2d at 450 (quoting State v. Delgado, 148 Wn.2d 723, 727, 63 P.3d 792 (2003)). The statute plainly criminalizes possession of certain tools, not actual or intended use. If the legislature had intended to include use within the scope of the statute, it could have done so by including the word \u201cused\u201d\u2014as it did with other criminal statutes dealing with tools, discussed below. The State\u2019s approach is similarly incorrect to the extent that it interprets \u201cdesigned\u201d to include an intent element. See Resp\u2019t\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 10. Had the legislature wanted to go beyond mere possession and criminalize intent to use a device to overcome a security system, it could have included specific language to that end. As an example, we point to RCW 9A.52.060, also discussed further below, in which the legislature clearly criminalized possession of burglar tools \u201cunder circumstances evincing an intent to use\u201d and \u201cknowing that the same is intended to be so used.\u201d RCW 9A.52.060(1) (emphasis added).\n\u00b615 The legislature\u2019s intent to limit the scope of 9A.56-.360(1)(b) is further supported by looking to other provisions within Title 9A RCW that deal similarly with the possession of tools during the commission a crime. Unlike RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b), these statutes explicitly extend beyond an item\u2019s design and mere possession. Under RCW 9A.52.060(2), making or having burglar tools is a gross misdemeanor. Burglar tools include any \u201cimplement adapted, designed, or commonly used\u201d to commit burglary. RCW 9A-.52.060(1). Identical language was adopted to define motor vehicle theft tools. RCW 9A.56.063(1). Similarly, a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d under RCW 9A.04.110 includes \u201cany other weapon, device, instrument, article, or substance,... which, under the circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used, or threatened to be used, is readily capable of causing death or substantial bodily harm.\u201d RCW 9A.04.110(6) (emphasis added).\n\u00b616 In all these instances, the legislature utilized appropriately broad language to capture any device that could be conceivably used to commit burglary or vehicle theft, or cause death or substantial bodily harm. By comparison, RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b)\u2019s language is decidedly narrower in scope. These statutes demonstrate that the legislature knows how to craft a broad statute when it wants to do so. See Gonzales Flores, 164 Wn.2d at 13. If the legislature had intended RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b) to have a broad application, it could have used appropriately broad language, as it did in other similar statutes.\n\u00b617 For the reasons discussed above, we hold that an item, article, implement, or device is \u201cdesigned to overcome security systems\u201d within the scope of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b) if it was created\u2014whether by a manufacturer or a defendant\u2014with the specialized purpose of overcoming security systems, lawfully or otherwise. However, we emphasize that we are preserving the illustrative and nonexclusive nature of the examples of lined bags and tag removers. Without question, someone will (and probably already has) come up with other specialized devices to efficiently evade security systems and facilitate retail theft. While commonly used tools with a general purpose, like wire cutters or pliers, do not fit within the narrow scope of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b), perhaps an ordinary tool that has been specifically modified for use in retail theft might constitute a device \u201cdesigned to overcome security systems.\u201d See Cenatis, 120 So. 3d at 44.\n\u00b618 Because we find the statute to be plain and unambiguous on its face, our analysis stops here. State v. Wilson, 125 Wn.2d 212, 217, 883 P.2d 320 1994) (\u201cPlain language does not require construction.\u201d (citing State v. Thornton, 119 Wn.2d 578, 580, 835 P.2d 216 (1992))). We do not resort to interpretive tools such as legislative history but nevertheless note that the legislative history supports our plain reading. Retail associations and individual retailers gave repeated testimony indicating that they were not concerned with ordinary, petty shoplifting but, rather, sophisticated retail theft rings working with fencing organizations to resell stolen merchandise. See, e.g., Hr\u2019g on H.B. 2704 Before the H. Criminal Justice and Corr. Comm., 59th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Jan. 27, 2006), at 19 min., 28 sec., audio recording by TVW, Washington State\u2019s Public Affairs Network, http://www.tvw.org (testimony by a loss prevention supervisor regarding the need to specifically target organized theft rings rather than typical shoplifters); see also Hr\u2019g on Substitute S.B. 5022 Before the H. Pub. Safety Comm., 63d Leg., Reg. Sess. (Mar. 5, 2013), at 44 min., 50 sec., audio recording by TVW, Washington State\u2019s Public Affairs Network, http://www.tvw.org (testimony on behalf of the Washington Retail Association, a prime sponsor of the original statute). The legislative history suggests that the statute was not intended to encompass crimes like the one committed by Larson.\nB. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\u00b619 The State bears the burden of proving every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Byrd, 125 Wn.2d 707, 713-14, 887 P.2d 396 (1995) (citing In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970)). When a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction is alleged, we review the evidence de novo in the light most favorable to the State. State v. Salinas, 119 Wn.2d 192, 201, 829 P.2d 1068 (1992). The conviction will be upheld if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Engel, 166 Wn.2d 572, 576, 210 P.3d 1007 (2009) (citing State v. Wentz, 149 Wn.2d 342, 347, 68 P.3d 282 (2003)).\n\u00b620 Larson asserts that because wire cutters do not fall within the scope of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b), the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for retail theft with \u201cextenuating\u201d circumstances under the statute. Because we find that the legislature did not intend to include wire cutters within the scope of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b), we agree that the evidence is not sufficient to support his conviction. Consequently, we reverse the Court of Appeals.\nConclusion\n\u00b621 A plain language analysis of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b), which includes looking at both the internal context of the provision itself and the broader statutory scheme, indicates that the legislature intended the statute to have a narrow scope. We hold that \u201cdesigned to overcome security systems\u201d for the purposes of retail theft with \u201cextenuating\u201d circumstances under RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b) is limited to those items, articles, implements, or devices created\u2014whether by the defendant or manufacturer\u2014with the specialized purpose of overcoming security systems. Ordinary tools, such as pliers or the wire cutters used by Larson, do not fall within the scope of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b). The evidence is insufficient to support Larson\u2019s conviction for third degree retail theft with \u201cextenuating\u201d circumstances, and we reverse the Court of Appeals.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Gordon McCloud, JJ., concur.\nRCW 9A.56.360 was amended, effective January 1, 2014, to replace all instances of \u201cextenuating circumstances\u2019\u2019 with \u201cspecial circumstances.\u2019\u2019 Laws of 2013, ch. 153, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3. This change was to account for the fact that the word \u201cextenuating\u201d actually refers to factors that mitigate rather than aggravate. See S.B. Rep. on Substitute S.B. 5022, at 2, 63d Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2013). The amendment did not affect the elements of the offense or alter the language at issue in this matter. We use \u201cextenuating circumstances\u201d since this is the language that Larson was charged and convicted under, but citations are to the current statute.\nHad Larson been charged under the general theft statute, his crime would have amounted to third degree theft, a gross misdemeanor. RCW 9A.56.050. Third degree retail theft with \u201cextenuating\u201d circumstances is a class C felony. RCW 9A.56.360(4). Gross misdemeanors are punishable by up to 364 days in jail, while class C felonies are punishable by up to 5 years in prison. RCW 9A.20.021(2), (1)(c). Larson was sentenced to 60 days in jail. Clerk\u2019s Papers at 58.\nThe dissent would have held that RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b) was ambiguous and the rule of lenity required that the statute be construed in Larson\u2019s favor. Larson, 185 Wn. App. at 912 (Trickey, J., dissenting).\nDivision One cautioned that excluding ordinary tools, such as wire cutters or pliers, would \u201cprovid[e] those inclined to commit retail theft with an unmistakable incentive to employ \u2018ordinary devices,\u2019 as characterized by the Reeves court, to pursue their nefarious ends.\u201d Larson, 185 Wn. App. at 912 (citing Reeves, 184 Wn. App. 154). While this may be a possible consequence of our ruling here, it is not within our power to rewrite the legislature\u2019s carefully chosen words.\nFlorida\u2019s retail theft statute makes it \u201cunlawful to possess, or use or attempt to use, any antishoplifting or inventory control device countermeasure.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.015(7). An \u201cantishoplifting or inventory control device countermeasure\u201d is defined as \u201cany item or device which is designed, manufactured, modified, or altered to defeat any antishoplifting or inventory control device.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7812.015(1)(i).\nIn State v. Blunt, 744 So. 2d 1258 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1999), the defendant\u2019s use of tinfoil to cover security tags did not fall within the statute. But in Cenatis, use of a \u201cbooster bag\u201d was found to qualify as an \u201cantishoplifting or inventory control device countermeasure.\u201d Cenatis, 120 So. 3d at 43-44. Distinguishing Blunt, the court in Cenatis stated that the defendant had \u201cused an ordinary item in an unusual way; the defendant did not manufacture, design, modify, or alter the tinfoil in any manner. In this case, however, ordinary items were combined in an unusual way to create a device capable of avoiding detection by the door sensors.\u201d Id.",

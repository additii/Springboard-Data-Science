And inasmuch as the judgment upon the delivery bond is dependent upon the judgment on which the execution issued, and on and by virtue of which the property mentioned in said bond was seized by the sheriff, and \"the latter has been reversed; therefore, the judgment on the delivery bond must also be reversed, annulled, and set aside, with costs, in accordance with the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Barton vs. Pettit & Bayard, reported in 7 Cranch, 288, and also, 2 Peters Cond.

John J. Clen-denin, one of the Circuit Judges. This bond was executed for the delivery of property levied on by virtue of an execution, issued on a judgment, obtained in the same Court, by L. & W. 11. Gibson, against Holden Moss and others, which judgment was reversed in this Court, as reported in the case last preceding."

C. Lewis,\n\u2018 \u2018 A. Lawrence Mills, receivers,\n\u201c Parties of First Part,\n\u201cMcWilliams Company, Inc.,\n\u201cParty of Second Part.\u201d\nIn defense to the action, appellee pleaded a settlement and complete release from liability under the bond by tbe receivers of tbe Farelly Lake Levee District and tbe statute of limitations as a bar to appellant\u2019s right to recover on tbe bond.\nTbe canse was submitted to tbe court, sitting as a jury, upon tbe issues joined, testimony showing that tbe stone was furnished to McWilliams Company, Inc., and used in tbe construction of tbe work, tbe original and supplemental contracts, and tbe following stipulation and receipt:\n\u2018 \u2018 STIPULATION\n\u201cIt is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between Chas. A. Walls, attorney for plaintiff, and O. E. Williams and W. M. Hall, attorneys for defendant, in tbe foregoing entitled cause of action, that:\n\u201c1. That McWilliams Company, Inc., became insolvent and went into tbe bands of receivers on tbe first day of March, 1929, and that tbe receivers for McWil-liams Company, Inc., elected not to proceed with tbe performance of tbe contract, and abandoned tbe contract that McWilliams Company, Inc., bad with Farelly Lake Levee District of Jefferson and Arkansas, for the construction of certain works, including tbe floodgates in said district.\n\u201c2. That tbe receivers of Farelly Lake Levee District, obligees on tbe bond, on or about March 10, 1929, took over tbe work and thereafter completed tbe work called for by the supplemental contract on or about December 12, 1929, at a cost exceeding tbe contract price by $15,398.04. There was included in said amount as part of tbe cost of completion additional engineering services of Ayres & Miller, engineers, amounting to $2,550, and tbe cost of leasing rails for a tramway needed in connection with the work from St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company, amounting to $858.29; and the cost of leasing right-of-way for tbe tramway from C. F. Rose, amounting\u2019 to $50, and tbe receivers, having exhausted their available cash, requested United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company to pay those amounts to said parties pending final settlement with tbe receivers, which said guaranty company did.\n\u201c3. That the receivers thereafter made demand upon said United 'States Fidelity & Guaranty Company under its bond for payment of the balance of $11,939.35, and said guaranty company, on April 9, 1930, paid said amount, and said receivers thereupon executed the receipt exhibited with the guaranty company\u2019s answer herein.\n\u201c4. It is further agreed that the receipt exhibited to the answer, dated April 9, 1930, is a true and exact copy of the original executed by the receivers of said district.\n\u201c5. It is further stipulated and agreed that this stipulation may be read in evidence on behalf of either party desiring to introduce same in the record.\n\u201c (Signed) Chas. A. Walls,\n\u201cAttorney for Plaintiff,\n\u201c (Signed) Wm. M. Hall,\n\u201cO. E. Williams,\n\u201cAttorneys for Defendant.\u201d\n\u201cBECEIPT\n\u201cBeceived of the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company eleven thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine dollars and seventy-five cents ($11,939.75) which with two thousand five hundred and fifty dollars ($2,-550) paid to Ayres & Miller, engineers, covering balance due them as engineering fees, eight hundred and fifty-eight dollars and twenty-nine cents ($858.29) paid to the St. Louis Southwestern Bailway Company covering amount due for lease of rails, and fifty dollars ($50) to C. F. Bose, covering amount due for lease of right-of-way is in full settlement, satisfaction and discharge of all liability of McWilliams Company and the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, its surety, under and by reason of a certain contract and bond executed on or about October 20, 1928, designated as supplemental contract to original contract of McWilliams Company dated July 31,1926.\n\u201cWitness onr bands tbis tbe 9tb day of April, 1930.\n\u201cG-eo. C. Lewis (s) and\n\u201cA. Lawrence Mills, receivers (s)\n\u201cFarelly Lake Levee District.\u201d\nTbe court found against appellant and dismissed its complaint, from wbicb finding and judgment an appeal has been duly prosecuted to tbis court.\nAppellant contends that tbe trial court should bave beld, and tbis court ought to bold, that the bond sued on is a special bond wbicb, in terms, guarantees tbe payment of all materials furnished and used by tbe contractor in completing tbe improvement. We are unable to discover any language in tbe bond itself wbicb would warrant any such interpretation even from inference. It cannot be gleaned from tbe language used that tbe bond was intended to be a statutory bond; so we would not be justified in reading tbe statute, \u00a7 6913 of Crawford & Moses\u2019 Digest, into tbe bond; but, if it were possible, by a strained construction, to do so, it would and could not afford any relief to appellant because, if aided by tbe statute invoked, its right of action would be barred. Section 6914 of Crawford & Moses\u2019 Digest bars rights of action on bonds for materials furnished if not brought within six months after tbe completion of tbe improvement. Appellant argues that it brought tbe suit for materials furnished within six months after tbe improvement was completed, but tbe agreed statement of facts and tbe receipt show otherwise. According to tbe agreed statement of facts and tbe receipt referred to, tbe work contemplated by tbe supplemental contract was completed on December 12, 1929, and this suit was not commenced until October 21, 1931.\nTbe trial court was correct in finding that tbe bond afforded no protection to appellant; hence tbe judgment is affirmed.",

        "text": "Per Curiam\n\u00b61 Scott Akrie and Volcan Group Inc., d/b/a NetLogix, sued James Grant, Kassandra Kennan, Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, Seattle Deposition Reporters LLC, and T-Mobile USA Inc. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants twice transcribed Jason Dillon\u2019s phone conversation without his permission and that in doing so they violated the privacy act, ch. 9.73 RCW. Dillon is not a party in this case.\n\u00b62 Defendants filed a special motion to strike the claims under the Washington Act Limiting Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (anti-SLAPP statute), RCW 4.24.525, and a motion to dismiss pursuant to CR 12(b)(6). The superior court granted both motions and dismissed the claims with prejudice. Pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute, RCW 4.24.525(6)(a), the superior court entered judgment ordering plaintiffs to pay defendants a statutory penalty of $10,000.00, attorney fees of $20,000.00, and litigation costs of $137.45.\n\u00b63 Plaintiffs appealed, and defendants cross appealed. Plaintiffs then withdrew their appeal and so defendants were redesignated as appellants. Defendants argued on appeal that under the anti-SLAPP statute, each defendant is entitled to $10,000 in SLAPP penalties, for a total of $50,000, rather than the total of $10,000 the superior court awarded. The Court of Appeals agreed. It reversed the superior court solely on the issue of statutory damages under the anti-SLAPP statute and remanded with instructions to enter judgment for $50,000 instead of $10,000 in statutory damages. Akrie v. Grant, 178 Wn. App. 506, 515, 315 P.3d 567 (2013).\n\u00b64 We granted plaintiffs\u2019 petition for review and heard oral arguments on September 30,2014. We later stayed this case, as well as Dillon v. Seattle Deposition Reporters, LLC (No. 89961-4), pending Davis v. Cox, a case involving the constitutionality of the anti-SLAPP statute. 183 Wn.2d 269, 351 P.3d 862 (2015). On May 28, 2015, the court decided Davis v. Cox, holding the anti-SLAPP statute violates the right to trial by jury under article I, section 21 of the Washington Constitution and is invalid. Accordingly, the stay of this case is lifted.\n\u00b65 In light of our decision in Davis, it is unnecessary to decide whether the proper amount of statutory damages under the anti-SLAPP statute in this case was $10,000 or $50,000 because the statute is unconstitutional and thus no longer provides grounds for any award of damages.\n\u00b66 The question remains, however, whether plaintiffs, who did not appeal the $10,000 statutory damages award, may benefit from our decision in Davis. The general rule is that an \u201cappellate court will grant a respondent affirmative relief by modifying the decision which is the subject matter of the review only ... if the respondent also seeks review of the decision by the timely filing of a notice of appeal or a notice of discretionary review.\u201d RAP 2.4(a)(1). Because plaintiffs withdrew their appeal, the decision that is the subject matter of the review cannot be modified under the general rule. The exception to the general rule is that an appellate court may grant a respondent affirmative relief \u201cif demanded by the necessities of the case.\u201d RAP 2.4(a)(2).\n\u00b67 We conclude that the necessities of this case justify granting plaintiffs the affirmative relief of vacating the superior court\u2019s award of statutory penalties, attorney fees, and costs under the anti-SLAPP statute. This case remained pending at the time we invalidated the anti-SLAPP statute, and thus basic fairness demands that we not sustain a penalty imposed pursuant to a statute we have held unconstitutional.\n\u00b68 The Court of Appeals is reversed. The case is remanded to the superior court with instructions to vacate any award of statutory damages, attorney fees, and costs under the anti-SLAPP statute. The superior court\u2019s judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claim with prejudice pursuant to defendants\u2019 motion under CR 12(b)(6) remains undisturbed and is final.\nThe same incidents resulted in another lawsuit, Dillon v. Seattle Deposition Reporters, LLC (No. 89961-4), which was dismissed on July 23,2015, where Dillon is the plaintiff.",

        "text": "Stephens, J.\n\u00b61 Erick Jordan asks this court to reverse a Court of Appeals decision affirming his convictions and sentence for second degree murder with a firearm enhancement and first degree unlawful possession of a firearm. At issue is whether differences between self-defense standards in Washington and Texas bar a sentencing court from finding that manslaughter convictions in these states are legally comparable. We hold they do not and affirm the lower court.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\u00b62 On July 13, 2007, Jordan fatally shot Maurice Jackson in front of two civilian witnesses and two police officers. Report of Proceedings (RP) (June 10, 2008) at 35-37; Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 11. He fled from the scene but was apprehended sometime later when he broke into the home of an elderly woman in order to escape from the police. 10 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (June 18, 2008) at 86, 97, 102, 105-06. When apprehended, Jordan was still carrying the .38 caliber revolver he used to kill Jackson. RP (June 16, 2008) at 88; 12 RP (June 23, 2008) at 344. The State charged Jordan with murder in the second degree with a firearm enhancement as well as unlawful possession of a firearm in the second degree. CP at 11-13. A jury found him guilty of both charges. CP at 14-16.\n\u00b63 At sentencing, the State proved that Jordan had previously been convicted of voluntary manslaughter in Texas in 1992. RP Sentencing (Jan. 16, 2009) at 15-17, 19. Jordan, however, objected to the inclusion of the Texas conviction in his offender score, arguing that his prior Texas offense was not legally comparable to any Washington offense because Washington and Texas have different standards for self-defense. Id. at 8. The trial court rejected this argument, finding voluntary manslaughter in Texas to be legally comparable to second degree murder in Washington. Id. at 19-20. Inclusion of the Texas conviction increased Jordan\u2019s offender score to eight, and the trial court sentenced him accordingly to a standard-range sentence of 417 months. CP at 155, 169-72. Jordan appealed his sentence, arguing, inter alia, that his Texas conviction was not legally comparable to any Washington offense and that its inclusion in his offender score calculation violated his due process rights. Br. of Appellant at 13-29.\n\u00b64 The Court of Appeals agreed with Jordan that his Texas conviction for voluntary manslaughter was not comparable to Washington\u2019s second degree murder because a person could be convicted of voluntary manslaughter in Texas without intentionally causing the death \u2014 a necessary element of second degree murder in Washington. State v. Jordan, No. 63016-4-1, slip op. (unpublished portion) at 7 (Wash. Ct. App. Nov. 1, 2010). The court, nonetheless, upheld the trial court\u2019s offender score calculation because voluntary manslaughter in Texas is legally comparable to first degree manslaughter in Washington, which scores the same points as second degree murder under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), chapter 9.94A RCW. Id. at 9 n.33 (unpublished portion). Jordan petitioned this court for review, insisting the Court of Appeals\u2019 comparability analysis was flawed because it failed to appreciate the differences between self-defense in Washington and Texas. According to Jordan, a Texas offense is never comparable to any Washington offense under RCW 9.94A.525 because Washington\u2019s self-defense laws excuse a broader range of otherwise criminal conduct. Jordan does not dispute the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis otherwise. We granted review. State v. Jordan, 176 Wn.2d 1023, 301 P.3d 1047 (2013).\nANALYSIS\n\u00b65 Questions regarding the comparability of offenses present issues of law that we review de novo. See State v. Stockwell, 159 Wn.2d 394, 397, 150 P.3d 82 (2007). Under the SRA, the standard sentencing range for an offense is determined by cross-referencing a defendant\u2019s offender score with the offense\u2019s seriousness level on the sentencing grid provided under RCW 9.94A.510. While the seriousness level of a particular crime is predefined under RCW 9.94A.515, a defendant\u2019s offender score is not. It is individual-specific and \u201cestimates the dangerousness and overall culpability of the defendant.\u201d State v. Wiley, 124 Wn.2d 679, 683, 880 P.2d 983 (1994). Its calculation depends on the seriousness of the present offense and the defendant\u2019s criminal history, including his out-of-state convictions. RCW 9.94A.525.\nDue Process Does Not Require Comparability of Defenses\n\u00b66 When considering out-of-state convictions, the SRA provides that \u201c[o]ut-of-state convictions for offenses shall be classified according to the comparable offense definitions and sentences provided by Washington law.\u201d RCW 9.94A.525(3) (emphasis added). We have interpreted this language to require \u201csubstantial[ ] similarity]\u201d between the elements of the foreign offense and the Washington offense. In re Pers. Restraint of Lavery, 154 Wn.2d 249, 255, 111 P.3d 837 (2005); see State v. Thiefault, 160 Wn.2d 409, 415, 158 P.3d 580 (2007); State v. Sublett, 176 Wn.2d 58, 87, 292 P.3d 715 (2012) (lead opinion). If the elements of the foreign offense are comparable to those of a Washington offense, then \u201cthe inquiry ends\u201d and the foreign crime counts toward the offender score as if it were the comparable Washington crime. Sublett, 176 Wn.2d at 87 (lead opinion); see also Lavery, 154 Wn.2d at 255. Jordan argues that due process requires parity not only between elements but also available defenses. Suppl. Br. of Pet\u2019r at 8. Jordan points out that his argument is consistent with our suggestion in other cases that the SRA requires comparability of elements and defenses. See Stockwell, 159 Wn.2d at 397; Lavery, 154 Wn.2d at 256. While we may have intimated this interpretation of the SRA framework in past cases, we have never said it is required as a matter of due process. Nor do we believe that it is.\n\u00b67 The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees that \u201c[n]o state shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Our state constitution similarly guarantees that \u201c[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d Const, art. I, \u00a7 3. Although the language of article I, section 3 is not identical to that of the Fourteenth Amendment, we have treated our state due process clause coextensively with its federal counterpart, and Jordan does not offer an analysis under State v. Gunwall, 106 Wn.2d 54, 61-62, 720 P.2d 808 (1986), to suggest different treatment applies in this case.\n\u00b68 Well-settled precedent recognizes that the sentencing process is \u201cless exacting than the process of establishing guilt.\u201dNichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738, 747, 114 S. Ct. 1921, 128 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1994). Minimal due process prohibits the State from sentencing a person convicted of a crime \u201con the basis of information which is false, lacks a minimum indicia of reliability, or is unsupported in the record,\u201d but it does not require strict proportionality between a crime and its punishment. State v. Ford, 137 Wn.2d 472, 481, 973 P.2d 452 (1999); see Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 962-65, 111 S. Ct. 2680, 115 L. Ed. 2d 836 (1991); Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 211 n.13, 97 S. Ct. 2319, 53 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1977); State v. Korum, 157 Wn.2d 614, 640-41, 141 P.3d 13 (2006). Under the due process clause, a sentencing judge \u201c \u2018may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may consider, or the source from which it may come.\u2019 \u201d Nichols, 511 U.S. at 747-48 (quoting United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S. Ct. 589, 30 L. Ed. 2d 592 (1972)). Thus, prior to Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004), the United States Supreme Court has upheld sentencing enhancements based on a defendant\u2019s criminal history even when such conduct did not result in a conviction. Nichols, 511 U.S. at 747 (citing Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 (1949); McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 2411, 91 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1986)).\n\u00b69 In Blakely, however, the Court held that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to a jury trial (as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment and hence applicable to the states), coupled with the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, provides a constitutional limit on the facts that a sentencing court can use to support a sentence above a statutorily mandated range. 542 U.S. 296. Because inclusion of his Texas conviction in his offender score affected the maximum possible sentence the sentencing court was authorized to enter, we interpret Jordan\u2019s due process clause argument as an application of those protections. This argument, however, is not persuasive.\n\u00b610 The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that Blakely\u2019s constitutional protections do not apply to \u201c \u2018the fact of a prior conviction,\u2019 \u201d id. at 301 (quoting Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000)). Only where the exact facts of a prior offense are used to increase the statutory maximum sentence a sentencing judge is authorized to enter do Blakely-type due process clause protections apply to limit judicial inquiry into the underlying circumstances of the prior conviction. See Descamps v. United States, _ U.S. _, 133 S. Ct. 2276, 186 L. Ed. 2d 438 (2013); Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 161 L. Ed. 2d 205 (2005).\n\u00b611 In this case, we do not have a debate about either the existence of the prior conviction or the facts of the underlying conviction. Instead, only the effect of the prior conviction is at issue. The parties disagree about whether a particular Texas conviction, with particular elements, and specific jury instructions (which are part of our record) are legally \u201ccomparable,\u201d in the language of RCW 9.94A.525(3), to any Washington conviction. This is a debate about a question of law, not fact. Blakely\u2019s limit on the facts that a judge can use to raise the statutory maximum is therefore inapplicable here. Whether the Court of Appeals\u2019 comparability analysis in this case complied with the statutory requirements of the SRA is a matter of statutory interpretation, not due process.\nRCW 9.94A.525(3) Does Not Require Comparability of Self-Defense Laws\n\u00b612 When interpreting the meaning of statutes, \u201c \u2018[t]he court\u2019s fundamental objective is to ascertain and carry out the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u2019 \u201d State v. Pannell, 173 Wn.2d 222, 226-27, 267 P.3d 349 (2011) (alteration in original) (quoting Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 9, 43 P.3d 4 (2002)).\n\u00b613 We have repeatedly recognized that the legislature purposefully created the SRA scheme broadly in order to \u201c \u2018ensure that defendants with equivalent prior convictions are treated \u201cthe same way, regardless of whether their prior convictions were incurred in Washington or elsewhere.\u201d \u2019 \u201d State v. Morley, 134 Wn.2d 588, 602, 952 P.2d 167 (1998) (quoting State v. Villegas, 72 Wn. App. 34, 38-39, 863 P.2d 560 (1993) (quoting State v. Weiand, 66 Wn. App. 29, 34, 831 P.2d 749 (1992))). The SRA instructs that \u201c[o]ut-of-state convictions for offenses shall be classified according to the comparable offense definitions and sentences provided by Washington law.\u201d RCW 9.94A.525(3). Once a sentencing judge determines the comparability of an offense, the judge tallies \u201cpoints\u201d reflecting the legislature\u2019s unfettered judgment about the relative severity of such prior convictions and rounds down the sum \u201cto the nearest whole number.\u201d RCW 9.94A.525(7)-(21). As illustrated under the SRA, crimes as diverse as premeditated murder and attempted kidnapping count the same number of points. RCW 9.94A-.525(4) (scoring anticipatory offenses as completed offenses), (9) (assigning three points for any serious violent offense), .030(45) (defining \u201cserious violent offense\u201d). And, convictions for attempt crimes are scored as if they were completed offenses. RCW 9.94A.525(4). The SRA even provides that if the sentencing court is unable to find a \u201cclearly comparable offense\u201d for a federal felony, \u201cthe offense shall be scored as a class C felony equivalent.\u201d RCW 9.94A.525(3).\n\u00b614 Given the legislature\u2019s broad purpose and the SRA\u2019s loose point assignment, we have interpreted the SRA as requiring rough comparability \u2014 not precision \u2014 among offenses. See Stockwell, 159 Wn.2d at 397 (noting \u201ccomparability analysis is not an exact science\u201d). Accordingly, we have declined to interpret the SRA to require judges to \u201cconduct the tedious task of comparing out-of-state criminal procedures to in-state procedures\u201d as part of its comparability analysis, reasoning that such interpretation would be \u201cclearly contrary to the purposes of the SRA.\u201d Morley, 134 Wn.2d at 596-98. Moreover, we noted that such interpretation would defeat the SRA framework because it \u201cwould exclude every out-of-state conviction from a defendant\u2019s criminal history.\u201d Id. Instead, we have consistently confirmed that legal comparability is satisfied when the elements of the foreign offense are comparable to those of a Washington offense. Sublett, 176 Wn.2d at 87 (lead opinion); Thiefault, 160 Wn.2d at 415; Lavery, 154 Wn.2d at 255-56.\n\u00b615 We recognize that in Washington, absence of self-defense has been considered an \u201celement\u201d of the crime. State v. McCullum, 98 Wn.2d 484, 493-94, 656 P.2d 1064 (1983) (\u201cOnce the issue of self-defense is properly raised,\u201d then negating it becomes an actual element: \u201cthe absence of self-defense becomes another element of the offense which the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); State v. Walden, 131 Wn.2d 469, 473, 932 P.2d 1237 (1997). But whether the failure of a court or jury to find the absence of self-defense in convicting a defendant on a foreign offense renders that conviction categorically not comparable to a Washington offense is not a question we must consider in this case. Here, the documents from the Texas conviction (which the State filed with the Washington court at sentencing) show that the Texas jury was instructed on self-defense and told that the State had the burden to disprove it. CP at 55. And, the jury convicted Jordan anyway. CP at 56. While Washington and Texas law may vary on when a defendant\u2019s conduct is excused as a matter of self-defense\u2014 such as when a defendant can take advantage of a \u201cstand your ground\u201d type of law \u2014 the SRA does not require exactitude, only \u201ccomparability.\u201d Lavery, 154 Wn.2d at 255. And we find Texas\u2019 self-defense law, as articulated in the jury instruction, sufficiently comparable to that of Washington.\n\u00b616 Requiring sentencing courts to consider the nuances of out-of-state self-defense laws is not only unnecessary under the SRA\u2019s comparability analysis, but it would also have far-reaching effects. Consider the possible nuances of self-defense. Unlike Washington, some 19 states still impose a common-law duty to retreat as a condition of claiming self-defense outside the home. See Eugene Volokh, Duty to Retreat and Stand Your Ground: Counting the States, The Volokh Conspiracy (July 17, 2013, 10:11 AM), http://www.volokh.com/2013/07/ 17/duty-to-retreat/. Convictions for murder, manslaughter, and assault from these states, including New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska, among 13 others, would fail the legal comparability test under Jordan\u2019s rule. Id. Even for those states that do not require a duty to retreat, the scope of the so-called \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d varies from state to state, as does the extent to which a defendant may claim self-defense on behalf of a third person. If the SRA required courts to compare self-defense laws from foreign states for exact equality, many otherwise comparable convictions for serious violent offenses would go uncounted, notwithstanding that the legislature \u201cobviously intended out-of-state convictions to be considered\u201d as part of a defendant\u2019s offender score. Morley, 134 Wn.2d at 597-98.\n\u00b617 Subjecting diverse out-of-state self-defense laws to the SRA comparability analysis would also create the \u201cminitrials over prior convictions\u201d we have consistently rejected. Wiley, 124 Wn.2d at 686; State v. Irish, 173 Wn.2d 787, 790, 272 P.3d 207 (2012) (declining to \u201cturn the current sentencing proceeding into an appellate review of all of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions\u201d (citing State v. Ammons, 105 Wn.2d 175, 188, 713 P.2d 719, 718 P2d 796 (1986))). And, construing the SRA as requiring analysis of the context of self-defense laws would likely generate a tidal wave of claims for postconviction relief. See Morley, 134 Wn.2d at 598 (noting that such a holding \u201cwould apply retroactively to the date the SRA was enacted\u201d and that \u201cevery single prisoner with out-of-state prior convictions\u201d could attack his or her sentence (citing In re Pers. Restraint of Johnson, 131 Wn.2d 558, 568, 933 P.2d 1019 (1997))). This would flout the legislature\u2019s intent in creating a rough comparability scheme under the SRA.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b618 Jordan\u2019s Texas manslaughter conviction was properly counted in his criminal history under the SRA. We adhere to our long-standing interpretation of the SRA as not requiring exact comparability and hold that a court need not analyze divergent self-defense laws as part of its comparability analysis. Nor does due process impose such a requirement. Because Jordan\u2019s sentence was consistent with both the SRA and constitutional minimums, we affirm the Court of Appeals.\nMadsen, C.J.; C. Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Gordon McCloud, JJ.; and J.M. Johnson, J. Pro Tem., concur.\nIn calculating Jordan\u2019s offender score, the trial court misassigned the Texas conviction two points, rather than the statutorily prescribed three points under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981, chapter 9.94A ROW. Suppl. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 5 n.3. Because we affirm the Court of Appeals, we need not consider the State\u2019s request that Jordan\u2019s offender score be recalculated at resentencing. Id.\nAlthough RCW 9.94A.525 has been amended five times since Jordan committed the present offense, the relevant language remains the same. See Laws of 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 35, \u00a7 8; Laws of 2011, ch. 166, \u00a7 3; Laws of 2010, ch. 274, \u00a7 403; Laws of 2008, ch. 231, \u00a7 3, Laws of 2007, ch. 199, \u00a7 8.

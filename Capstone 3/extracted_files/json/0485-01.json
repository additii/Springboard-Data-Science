        "text": "Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\n\u00b61 The Ninth Circuit has asked this court to answer:\nWhat does \u201ccollapse\u201d mean under Washington law in an insurance policy that insures \u201caccidental direct physical loss involving collapse,\u201d subject to the policy\u2019s terms, conditions, exclusions, and other provisions, but does not define \u201ccollapse,\u201d except to state that \u201ccollapse does not include settling, cracking, shrinking, bulging or expansion?\u201d\nQueen Anne Park Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 763 F.3d 1232, 1235 (9th Cir. 2014). Rather than adopt a fixed definition of \u201ccollapse\u201d for all insurance contracts, we apply Washington law to interpret the ambiguous term \u201ccollapse\u201d in the insurance contract before the Ninth Circuit. We conclude that in the insurance contract, \u201ccollapse\u201d means \u201csubstantial impairment of structural integrity.\u201d \u201cSubstantial impairment of structural integrity\u201d means substantial impairment of the structural integrity of a building or part of a building that renders such building or part of a building unfit for its function or unsafe and, under the clear language of the insurance policy here, must be more than mere settling, cracking, shrinkage, bulging, or expansion.\nFacts\n\u00b62 Queen Anne Park (QAP) is a two-building condominium in Seattle that was insured under a State Farm Fire and Casualty Company policy (Policy). The Policy was in effect from October 18, 1992 to October 18, 1998.\n\u00b63 The Policy covered \u201caccidental direct physical loss\u201d to insured property, unless the loss was excluded or limited. Appellant\u2019s Excerpts of Rs. (ER) at 136, 138-40. An \u201c[e]x-tension of [c] overage\u201d covered \u201cany accidental direct physical loss to covered property involving collapse of a building or any part of a building caused only by one or more of the following: ... (2) hidden decay.\u201d Id. at 141-42. The coverage extension also provided that \u201c[c]ollapse does not include settling, cracking, shrinking, bulging or expansion.\u201d Id. at 142. Neither the Policy nor its extensions otherwise defined the term \u201ccollapse.\u201d\n\u00b64 The QAP homeowners\u2019 association (HOA) filed a claim with State Farm in 2010, claiming that QAP had collapsed, which the HOA interpreted to mean \u201ca substantial impairment of the structural integrity of any portion or component of the building.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Suppl. Excerpts of Rs. at 5. The HOA claimed that QAP had \u201cseveral areas of hidden decay\u201d and that the HOA\u201cbelieve[d] that these and other areas suffered a substantial impairment of structural integrity during [the] policy periods.\u201d Id. The HOA\u2019s claim was based on an HOA engineer finding hidden decay in some shear walls (plywood/gypsum sheathings), which he opined had substantially impaired the walls\u2019 ability to resist lateral loads. ER at 119-22. After conducting its own inspections, in 2011, State Farm denied the HOA\u2019s claim and concluded that \u201c[a] loss involving collapse\u201d had \u201cnot commence [d] in any policy term\u201d and that various exclusions to coverage applied. Id. at 218 (emphasis omitted).\n\u00b65 The HOA filed suit in the Western District of Washington, seeking declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract. The Western District of Washington granted summary judgment in favor of State Farm. The HOA appealed to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit certified a question of state law to this court. Queen Anne Park Homeowners Ass\u2019n, 763 F.3d at 1235.\nAnalysis\n\u00b66 RCW 2.60.020 authorizes this court to accept certified questions from federal courts. \u201cCertified questions from federal court are questions of law that we review de novo.\" Bradburn v. N. Cent. Reg\u2019l Library Dist., 168 Wn.2d 789, 799, 231 P.3d 166 (2010) (citing In re F5 Networks, Inc., 166 Wn.2d 229, 236, 207 P.3d 433 (2009)). \u201cWe do not consider the legal issues in the abstract but instead consider them based on the certified record that the federal court provides \u201d Id. (citing RCW 2.60.030(2); St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Onvia, Inc., 165 Wn.2d 122, 126, 196 P.3d 664 (2008)). \u201cConstruction of an insurance policy is a question of law for the courts, the policy is construed as a whole, and the policy \u2018should be given a fair, reasonable, and sensible construction as would be given to the contract by the average person purchasing insurance.\u2019 \u201d Queen City Farms, Inc. v. Cent. Nat'l Ins. Co. of Omaha, 126 Wn.2d 50, 65, 882 P.2d 703 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Grange Ins. Co. v. Brosseau, 113 Wn.2d 91, 95, 776 P.2d 123 (1989)).\n\u00b67 \u201c \u2018[Contractual terms are ambiguous if they are subject to more than one reasonable interpretation when applied to a particular set of facts.\u2019 \u201d Quadrant Corp. v. Am. States Ins. Co., 154 Wn.2d 165, 181, 110 P.3d 733 (2005) (quoting Madison Constr. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., 557 Pa. 595, 606, 735 A.2d 100 (1999)). We find that the term \u201ccollapse\u201d in the Policy is ambiguous because it is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\n\u00b68 Illustrative of this is our opinion in Sprague v. Safeco Insurance Co. of America, 174 Wn.2d 524, 276 P.3d 1270 (2012), where we were asked to define the term \u201ccollapse\u201d in Washington insurance policies. While the court decided the case on different grounds, both the dissent and the concurrence proposed different definitions of \u201ccollapse.\u201d Id. This alone demonstrates that \u201ccollapse\u201d is an ambiguous term. The division of our court is reflected in courts across the country that have adopted different but reasonable definitions of \u201ccollapse\u201d in insurance policies. See, e.g., Olmstead v. Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co., 22 Ohio St. 2d 212, 259 N.E.2d 123, 126 (1970) (defining \u201ccollapse\u201d as \u201ca falling down, falling together, or caving into an unorganized mass\u201d); Am. Concept Ins. Co. v. Jones, 935 F. Supp. 1220, 1227 (D. Utah 1996) (defining \u201ccollapse\u201d as substantial impairment of structural integrity); Buczek v. Cont'l Cas. Ins. Co., 378 F.3d 284, 290 (3d Cir. 2004) (defining \u201ccollapse\u201d as substantial impairment of structural integrity that \u201c \u2018connotes imminent collapse threatening the preservation of the building as a structure or . . . health and safety5 \u201d (quoting Fantis Foods, Inc. v. N. River Ins. Co., 332 N.J. Super. 250, 260, 753 A.2d 176 (App. Div. 2000))). An undefined term \u201ccollapse\u201d in an insurance policy is an ambiguous term because it is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, demonstrated by the range of reasonable definitions of \u201ccollapse\u201d adopted by various courts.\n\u00b69 Undefined terms in an insurance policy \u201care to be interpreted in accord with the understanding of the average purchaser of insurance, and the terms are to be given their plain, ordinary and popular meaning.\u201d Queen City Farms, Inc., 126 Wn.2d at 77. Importantly,\n[i]t is Hornbook law that where a clause in an insurance policy is ambiguous, the meaning and construction most favorable to the insured must be applied, even though the insurer may have intended another meaning. Jeffries v. General Cas. Co. of America, 46 Wn.2d 543, 283 P.2d 128 (1955); Kane v. Order of United Commercial Travelers of America, 3 Wn.2d 355, 100 P.2d 1036 (1940). Ambiguous exclusionary clauses, particularly, should be construed in the manner most favorable to the insured. Brown v. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, 53 Wn.2d 142, 332 P.2d 228 (1958); Murray v. Western Pac. Ins. Co., 2 Wn. App. 985, 472 P.2d 611 (1970).\nDairyland Ins. Co. v. Ward, 83 Wn.2d 353, 358, 517 P.2d 966 (1974). The definition of \u201ccollapse\u201d requested by the insured \u2014 substantial impairment of structural integrity \u2014 is a reasonable definition because it comports with the commonsense meaning of \u201ccollapse,\u201d which is evident from it having been adopted as the definition of \u201ccollapse\u201d by many courts across the country and used by State Farm in at least one other case. Mercer Place Condo. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 104 Wn. App. 597, 600, 17 P.3d 626 (2000) (State Farm agreed with the insured that the word \u201ccollapse\u201d in the policy in that case meant \u201c \u2018substantial impairment of structural integrity.\u2019 \u201d); see, e.g., Am. Concept Ins. Co., 935 F. Supp. at 1227-28; Beach v. Middlesex Mut. Assurance Co., 205 Conn. 246, 252-53, 532 A.2d 1297 (1987).\n\u00b610 Here the insured requests that \u201ccollapse\u201d be interpreted to mean \u201csubstantial impairment of structural integrity.\u201d We largely agree. Of the definitions offered to us, substantial impairment of structural integrity is both reasonable and the most favorable to the insured. Based on the language of the Policy, however, we caution that \u201ccollapse\u201d must mean something more than mere \u201csettling, cracking, shrinking, bulging or expansion.\u201d ER at 142. Also, we note that \u201cstructural integrity\u201d of a building means a building\u2019s ability to remain upright and \u201csubstantial impairment\u201d means a severe impairment. Taken together, \u201csubstantial impairment\u201d of \u201cstructural integrity\u201d means an impairment so severe as to materially impair a building\u2019s ability to remain upright. Considering the Policy as a whole, we conclude that \u201csubstantial impairment of structural integrity\u201d means the substantial impairment of the structural integrity of all or part of a building that renders all or part of the building unfit for its function or unsafe and, in this case, means more than mere settling, cracking, shrinkage, bulging, or expansion.\nConclusion\n\u00b611 \u201cCollapse\u201d in the Policy means the substantial impairment of structural integrity of a building or part of a building that renders such building or part of a building unfit for its function or unsafe in a manner that is more than mere settling, cracking, shrinkage, bulging, or expansion.\nJohnson, Owens, Stephens, Wiggins, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nAccording to the dissent, \u201c \u2018[clollapse\u2019 is not a vague term and is not ambiguous.\u201d Dissent at 493. The term \u201ccollapse\u201d is ambiguous because it is \u201c \u2018subject to more than one reasonable interpretation when applied to a particular set of facts.\u2019 \u201d Quadrant Corp., 154 Wn.2d at 181 (quoting Madison Constr. Co., 557 Pa. at 606). For example, while State Farm argues that the term \u201ccollapse\u201d is \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d and \u201cthe average purchaser would not think that the State Farm policy is ambiguous,\u201d State Farm itself does not offer an exact definition of \u201ccollapse,\u201d which supports the conclusion that the term is ambiguous. Br. of Appellee at 16, 36. State Farm argues that \u201cthe average purchaser of insurance would define \u2018collapse\u2019 to include something less than total destruction: a structure\u2019s significant falling or caving, albeit not to the ground, or perhaps imminent falling or caving or similar damage,\u201d id. at 6-7, but also offers a definition without imminency, id. at 18 (\u201c[T]he average purchaser of insurance would understand \u2014 not only rubble-on-the ground, but also a significant falling or caving in that does not reach the ground.\u201d). Also, as the dissent recognizes, circuits and courts do not agree on a single definition of \u201ccollapse,\u201d instead defining \u201c \u2018collapse\u2019 in three major ways \u2014 actual collapse, imminent collapse, and substantial impairment of structural integrity.\u201d Dissent at 494 (footnote omitted). Furthermore, not only does the dissent disagree with this opinion, the dissent and concurrence in Sprague provided two different, reasonable interpretations of \u201ccollapse\u201d both supported by definitions of \u201ccollapse\u201d in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. Sprague, 174 Wn.2d at 532-38. Finally, we note that the Ninth Circuit asked us to define \u201ccollapse.\u201d Queen Anne Park Homeowners Ass'n, 763 F.3d at 1235. If \u201ccollapse\u201d was unambiguous, the Ninth Circuit would not have needed to certify that question to us. The dissent fails to show that the term \u201ccollapse\u201d is not ambiguous.\nWe disagree that \u201csubstantial impairment of structural integrity\u201d may be interpreted so loosely as to convert an insurance policy \u201cinto a maintenance agreement by allowing recovery for damage which, while substantial, does not threaten collapse.\u201d Ocean Winds Council of Co-Owners, Inc. v. Auto-Owner Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 268, 271, 565 S.E.2d 306 (2002).",

        "text": "Fairhurst, J.\n\u00b612 (dissenting) \u2014 This case presents the question of \u201c[w]hat does \u2018collapse\u2019 mean under Washington law in an insurance policy that insures \u2018accidental direct physical loss involving collapse,\u2019 . . . but does not define \u2018collapse.\u2019 \u201d Queen Anne Park Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 763 F.3d 1232, 1235 (9th Cir. 2014). By defining \u201ccollapse\u201d as \u201c \u2018substantial impairment of structural integrity,\u2019 \u201d the majority expands the meaning of \u201ccollapse\u201d from its commonsense and traditional definition. Majority at 487. Because \u201csubstantial impairment of structural integrity\u201d is too far removed from the ordinary meaning of \u201ccollapse,\u201d I respectfully dissent.\n\u00b613 This court has not yet defined \u201ccollapse\u201d for insurance policies that lack a contractual definition. In Sprague v. Safeco Insurance Co. of America, 174 Wn.2d 524, 276 P.3d 1270 (2012), the majority of this court declined to define \u201ccollapse\u201d but Justice Stephens\u2019 dissent and Justice Alexander\u2019s concurrence each proposed competing definitions. The majority here agrees with Justice Stephens\u2019 dissent in Sprague by holding that \u201csubstantial impairment of structural integrity\u201d is a reasonable definition of \u201ccollapse.\u201d Majority at 491; see Sprague, 174 Wn.2d at 534 (Stephens, J., dissenting). In doing so, the majority expands the meaning of \u201ccollapse\u201d beyond its ordinary definition. I agree with Justice Alexander\u2019s concurrence in Sprague and would hold that collapse occurs when a building falls, crumbles, or caves in. 174 Wn.2d at 532.\n\u00b614 \u201cCollapse\u201d is not a vague term and is not ambiguous. We interpret an insurance policy as an average purchaser would read it and avoid technical interpretations. Boeing Co. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 113 Wn.2d 869, 881, 784 P.2d 507 (1990). To determine the plain, ordinary, and popular meaning of \u201ccollapse,\u201d we look to definitions in standard English dictionaries. Overton v. Consol. Ins. Co., 145 Wn.2d 417, 428, 38 P.3d 322 (2002). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 443 (2002) gives the definition of \u201ccollapse,\u201d a noun, as \u201cthe action of collapsing: the act or action of drawing together or permitting or causing a falling together.\u201d Further, the verb form of \u201ccollapse\u201d is defined as \u201cto break down completely : fall apart in confused disorganization : crumble into insignificance or nothingness\u201d and \u201cto fall or shrink together abruptly and completely: fall into a jumbled or flattened mass through the force of external pressure.\u201d Id.\n\u00b615 Each definition includes a reference to falling down or falling apart. I would therefore hold that \u201ccollapse\u201d in this contract occurs when a building falls, crumbles, or caves in. \u201cSubstantial impairment of structural integrity\u201d is not present in any accepted dictionary definition of \u201ccollapse.\u201d\n\u00b616 Courts across the country have defined \u201ccollapse\u201d in three major ways \u2014 actual collapse, imminent collapse, and substantial impairment of structural integrity. Cent. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Royal, 269 Ala. 372, 375, 113 So. 2d 680 (1959) (finding no collapse when there was no actual collapse or rubble on the ground); Doheny W. Homeowners\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Am. Guar. & Liab. Ins. Co., 60 Cal. App. 4th 400, 70 Cal. Rptr. 2d 260 (1997) (holding that policy means collapse must be actual or imminent); Beach v. Middlesex Mut. Assurance Co., 205 Conn. 246, 252-53, 532 A.2d 1297 (1987) (holding that \u201ccollapse\u201d is defined as \u201csubstantial impairment of the structural integrity\u201d)- Although \u201ccollapse\u201d was first interpreted under the strict \u201crubble on the ground\u201d standard, several courts have relaxed the definition of \u201ccollapse.\u201d Royal, 269 Ala. 375; Fid. & Cas. Co. of N.Y. v. Mitchell, 503 So. 2d 870, 871 (Ala. Civ. App. 1987) (holding that rubble on the ground is not required for collapse); Hennessy v. Mut. of Enumclaw Ins. Co., 228 Or. App. 186, 194, 206 P.3d 1184 (2009) (holding that collapse occurs when an object falls some distance).\n\u00b617 As noted by the majority, several state and federal courts have gone further, recognizing \u201csubstantial impairment of structural integrity\u201d as the proper definition of \u201ccollapse.\u201d Majority at 491; Am. Concept Ins. Co. v. Jones, 935 F. Supp. 1220, 1227 (D. Utah 1996); Beach, 205 Conn, at 252-53. These courts have used this definition to hold insurance companies liable for types of damage that do not fall under the dictionary definition of \u201ccollapse.\u201d Beach, 205 Conn, at 253 (holding insurance company liable for collapse when foundation contained cracks); Am. Concept Ins., 935 F. Supp. at 1223, 1228 (holding insurance company liable for collapse when cracking occurred in floorboards). I would agree with courts who have held that \u201ccollapse\u201d does not require a complete falling and flattening of a building. See Hennessy, 228 Or. App. at 194. However, I would hold that \u201csubstantial impairment of structural integrity\u2019 is too far removed from an average person\u2019s interpretation of \u201ccollapse.\u201d\n\u00b618 Additionally, \u201ccollapse\u201d and \u201csubstantial impairment of structural integrity\u201d are nonsynonymous terms that cover different sets of facts. A building can have substantial impairment of structural integrity and not collapse. In American Concept Insurance, 935 F. Supp. at 1223, the policyholder\u2019s house was damaged by a water leak. Engineers described the damage as cracking in the floors and walls and concluded that the house had suffered a substantial impairment of structural integrity. Id. at 1224. But, the home had not fallen, crumbled, or caved in. Id. Thus, a court would likely find that the home in American Concept Insurance had suffered substantial impairment of structural integrity but had not collapsed. Furthermore, a building can collapse but not suffer substantial impairment of structural integrity. Under a policy that covers collapse of a building, or any part of a building, the crumbling of a nonweight bearing wall would qualify as a collapse. But, the crumbling of a non-weight bearing wall does not substantially impair the structural integrity of a building.\n\u00b619 By interpreting \u201ccollapse\u201d as \u201csubstantial impairment of structural integrity,\u201d the majority is turning a simple word into an imprecise legal standard. In order to preserve the commonsense and traditional meaning of \u201ccollapse,\u201d I would hold that \u201ccollapse\u201d in this contract occurs when a building falls, crumbles, or caves in. For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\nMadsen, C.J., and Gordon McCloud, J., concur with Fairhurst, J.\nJustice Stephens\u2019 dissent in Sprague cites an alternate definition of \u201ccollapse\u201d where it is defined as \u201c \u2018a breakdown of vital energy, strength, or stamina.\u2019 \u201d 174 Wn.2d at 534 (quoting Webster\u2019s, supra, at 443). This definition is not relevant and should not be applied to interpret \u201ccollapse\u201d here because it is referring to the emotional and mental collapse of an individual, not the collapse of a structure.\nI disagree with State Farm that \u201cimminent collapse\u201d is a valid definition of \u201ccollapse\u201d in this contract because it would require reading an element of imminence into the policy.

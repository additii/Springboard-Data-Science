        "text": "J.M. Johnson, J.\n\u00b61 \u2014 Petitioner Alvin Witherspoon\nchallenges his conviction and life sentence for second degree robbery. Because the robbery conviction was his third \u201cmost serious offense,\u201d he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of release under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA) of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), chapter 9.94A RCW; RCW 9.94A-.570. We affirm the Court of Appeals, upholding Witherspoon\u2019s conviction and sentence.\nFacts and Procedural History\n\u00b62 On November 12, 2009, Witherspoon and his fianc\u00e9e drove to the victim\u2019s home. Witherspoon does not dispute that he then broke into the victim\u2019s home and stole several items. While the burglary was in progress, the victim returned home and noticed an unknown car parked in her driveway. The victim exited her car and saw Witherspoon walking from around the side of her home. He was holding his left hand behind his back. The victim testified at trial that she asked Witherspoon what he had behind his back, and he said he had a pistol. He then got in his car and drove away. The victim noticed some of her belongings in the back of his car, followed him in her own car, and called 911 as he fled the scene. Police arrested Witherspoon and his fianc\u00e9e, obtained a search warrant, and found multiple items belonging to the victim in their home. From jail, Witherspoon called his fianc\u00e9e, attempting to convince her to stop talking to the police and lie about the crime. The phone conversation was recorded by the jail.\n\u00b63 A jury found Witherspoon guilty of residential burglary and second degree robbery based on the events of November 12, 2009. See RCW 9A.52.025(1); RCW 9A.56-.190, .210(1). The jury also found him guilty of witness tampering based on the jailhouse phone conversation he had with his fianc\u00e9e after his arrest. See RCW 9A.72-.120(1). At sentencing, the court determined that the certified conviction documents met the State\u2019s burden to prove two prior strike convictions. The court found that Wither-spoon is a persistent offender and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of early release.\n\u00b64 On appeal, he challenged his convictions and sentence on a number of grounds. The Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions and sentence. State v. Witherspoon, 171 Wn. App. 271, 286 P.3d 996 (2012). Witherspoon sought discretionary review in this court, which was granted on only four issues. State v. Witherspoon, 177 Wn.2d 1007, 300 P.3d 416 (2013).\nIssues\n\u00b65 1. Whether there was sufficient evidence to support Witherspoon\u2019s second degree robbery conviction.\n\u00b66 2. Whether Witherspoon\u2019s counsel was ineffective in not asking for an instruction on first degree theft as a lesser included offense.\n\u00b67 3. Whether Witherspoon\u2019s persistent offender sentence constitutes cruel or cruel and unusual punishment.\n\u00b68 4. Whether Witherspoon\u2019s previous strike offenses should have been proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAnalysis\n1. There Was Sufficient Evidence To Support Witherspoon\u2019s Second Degree Robbery Conviction\n\u00b69 Witherspoon claims that insufficient evidence exists to prove all elements of second degree robbery, as instructed to the jury. \u201cThe test for determining the sufficiency of the evidence is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v. Salinas, 119 Wn.2d 192, 201, 829 P.2d 1068 (1992) (citing State v. Green, 94 Wn.2d 216, 220-22, 616 P.2d 628 (1980)). Witherspoon must accordingly admit the truth of the State\u2019s evidence and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from such evidence. Id. We must also defer to the fact finder on issues of witness credibility. State v. Drum, 168 Wn.2d 23, 35, 225 P.3d 237 (2010) (citing State v. Camarillo, 115 Wn.2d 60, 71, 794 P.2d 850 (1990)). In this case, a rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently, sufficient evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\n\u00b610 Pursuant to RCW 9A.56.190:\nA person commits robbery when he or she unlawfully takes personal property from the person of another or in his or her presence against his or her will by the use or threatened use of immediate force, violence, or fear of injury to that person or his or her property or the person or property of anyone. Such force or fear must be used to obtain or retain possession of the property, or to prevent or overcome resistance to the taking; in either of which cases the degree of force is immaterial. Such taking constitutes robbery whenever it appears that, although the taking was fully completed without the knowledge of the person from whom taken, such knowledge was prevented by the use of force or fear.[]\n(Emphasis added.) The jury instruction in this case included the statutory language above but omitted the word \u201csuch\u201d from the phrase \u201csuch force or fear must be used to obtain or retain possession of the property.\u201d It therefore read, in part, \u201cThat force or fear was used by the Defendant to obtain or retain possession of the property or to prevent or overcome resistance to the taking or to prevent knowledge of the taking.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 55 (Instruction 11).\n\u00b611 Witherspoon asserts that under the law of the case doctrine, the jury instruction required the State to prove actual force or fear. This doctrine provides that a jury instruction not objected to becomes the law of the case. State v. Willis, 153 Wn.2d 366, 374, 103 P.3d 1213 (2005) (citing State v. Hickman, 135 Wn.2d 97, 102, 954 P.2d 900 (1998)). \u201cIn a criminal case, the State assumes the burden of proving otherwise unnecessary elements of the offense when such elements are included without objection in a jury instruction.\u201d Id. at 374-75 (citing Hickman, 135 Wn.2d at 102). Contrary to Witherspoon\u2019s assertion, the exclusion of the word \u201csuch\u201d does not change the plain meaning of the instruction in a way that requires the State to prove actual force or fear.\n\u00b612 Witherspoon claims that he made, at most, an implied threat that instilled no fear. He further claims that even if there had been force or fear, it did not help accomplish the robbery because the victim did not know that Witherspoon had taken any of her property until he drove away. He contends that her ignorance did not stem from force, fear, or threats. Because we determine intimidation based on an objective test, Witherspoon\u2019s argument does not stand.\n\u00b613 \u201cRobbery encompasses any \u2018taking of . . . property [that is] attended with such circumstances of terror, or such threatening by menace, word or gesture as in common experience is likely to create an apprehension of danger and induce a man to part with property for the safety of his person.\u2019 \u201d State v. Shcherenkov, 146 Wn. App. 619, 624-25, 191 P.3d 99 (2008) (alterations in original) (quoting State v. Redmond, 122 Wash. 392, 393, 210 R 772 (1922)). To determine whether the defendant used intimidation, we use an objective test. We consider whether an ordinary person in the victim\u2019s position could reasonably infer a threat of bodily harm from the defendant\u2019s acts. Id. at 625 (quoting 67 Am. Jur. 2d Robbery \u00a7 89, at 114 (2003)).\n\u00b614 Taking the facts in the light most favorable to the State, a rational jury could have found that Witherspoon used force or the threatened use of force in this case. The victim testified at trial that she noticed an unknown car in her driveway when she arrived home. As she exited her car, she saw Witherspoon come around the side of her home with one hand behind his back. She testified that she asked him what he had behind his back and he said he had a pistol. A rational jury could have found that this was an implied threat that he would use force if necessary to retain her property. The evidence is sufficient to prove the elements of second degree robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. We accordingly affirm the Court of Appeals, which upheld Witherspoon\u2019s robbery conviction.\n2. Witherspoon Does Not Prove That Counsel Was Ineffective in Not Asking for an Instruction on First Degree Theft as a Lesser Included Offense\n\u00b615 Witherspoon argues ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel did not request an instruction on theft as a lesser included offense. Counsel\u2019s performance, however, did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.\n\u00b616 In order for a petitioner to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, he must overcome the presumption that his counsel was effective. State v. Thiefault, 160 Wn.2d 409, 414, 158 P.3d 580 (2007). \u201c[C]ounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 690, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). To overcome this presumption, Witherspoon must demonstrate that \u201c(1) \u2018counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u2019 and (2) \u2018the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u2019 \u201d In re Pers. Restraint of Yates, 177 Wn.2d 1, 35, 296 P.3d 872 (2013) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-88). However, \u201cif a personal restraint petitioner makes a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim, he has necessarily met his burden to show actual and substantial prejudice.\u201d In re Pers. Restraint of Grace, 174 Wn.2d 835, 846-47, 280 P.3d 1102 (2012). Accordingly, to prevail on his claim, Witherspoon must prove that trial counsel\u2019s \u201cacts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690.\n\u00b617 Under RCW 10.61.006, both the defendant and the State have the right to present a lesser included offense to the jury. State v. Stevens, 158 Wn.2d 304, 310, 143 P.3d 817 (2006). To prove the lesser included offense, the party requesting the instruction must meet a two-pronged test: (1) \u201cunder the legal prong, all of the elements of the lesser offense must be a necessary element of the charged offense\u201d and (2) \u201cunder the factual prong, the evidence must support an inference that the lesser crime was committed.\u201d Id. (citing State v. Gamble, 154 Wn.2d 457, 462-63, 114 P.3d 646 (2005)).\n\u00b618 In State v. Grier, 171 Wn.2d 17, 39, 246 P.3d 1260 (2011), we recognized that whether to request a jury instruction on lesser included offenses is a tactical decision. \u201cThus, assuming that defense counsel has consulted with the client in pursuing an all or nothing approach, a court should not second-guess that course of action, even where, by the court\u2019s analysis, the level of risk is excessive and a more conservative approach would be more prudent.\u201d Id. Here, the tactical decision was prudent, if unsuccessful.\n\u00b619 Witherspoon\u2019s trial counsel chose to take an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach that included not requesting a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of theft. Admittedly, conviction for the robbery charge was a close call. Witherspoon and his counsel chose to tactically defend on the possibility that the State could not prove to the jury that the property was taken by the use or threatened use of force or injury. See RCW 9A.56.190. They lost that bet, and the jury convicted Witherspoon of second degree robbery.\n\u00b620 Witherspoon failed to meet his burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals on this issue.\n3. Witherspoon\u2019s Persistent Offender Sentence Does Not Constitute Cruel or Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n\u00b621 In addition to challenging his robbery conviction, Witherspoon also challenges his POAA sentence. He claims that his life sentence violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 14 of the Washington State Constitution. The Eighth Amendment bars cruel and unusual punishment while article I, section 14 bars cruel punishment. This court has held that the state constitutional provision is more protective than the Eighth Amendment in this context. State v. Rivers, 129 Wn.2d 697, 712, 921 P.2d 495 (1996) (citing State v. Fain, 94 Wn.2d 387, 392-93, 617 P.2d 720 (1980)). Consequently, if we hold that Witherspoon\u2019s life sentence does not violate the more protective state provision, we do not need to further analyze the sentence under the Eighth Amendment. See id.\n\u00b622 Fain provides four factors to consider in analyzing whether punishment is prohibited as cruel under article I, section 14: \u201c(1) the nature of the offense, (2) the legislative purpose behind the statute, (3) the punishment the defendant would have received in other jurisdictions, and (4) the punishment meted out for other offenses in the same jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 713 (citing Fain, 94 Wn.2d at 397). In Rivers, we analyzed facts similar to the ones in this case under the Fain factors. In Rivers, a jury returned a verdict of guilty on the robbery charge. Rivers was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of release because he was found to have committed three most serious offenses. He challenged his sentence on a number of grounds, including that it violated both the Eighth Amendment and article I, section 14. This court applied the Fain factors, concluding that the POAA, as applied to Rivers, was not unconstitutional. Id. We reach the same conclusion in this case.\n\u00b623 The first Fain factor is the nature of the offense. Id. As was noted in Rivers, robbery is a most serious offense. Id.) RCW 9.94A.030(32)(o). \u201cThe nature of the crime of robbery includes the threat of violence against another person.\u201dRivers, 129 Wn.2d at 713. Here, the victim testified that the defendant told her he had a gun behind his back. This statement contains an implied threat.\n\u00b624 The second Fain factor is the legislative purpose behind the statute. Id. In Rivers, we recognized that \u201cthe purposes of the persistent offender law include deterrence of criminals who commit three \u2018most serious offenses\u2019 and the segregation of those criminals from the rest of society.\u201d Id. (citing State v. Thorne, 129 Wn.2d 736, 775, 921 P.2d 514 (1996), abrogated on other grounds by Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004)).\n\u00b625 The third Fain factor is the punishment that the defendant would have received in other jurisdictions. Id. at 714. According to the concurrence/dissent, there are only three states outside of Washington in which a conviction of second degree robbery as a \u201cthird strike\u201d offense triggers a mandatory sentence of life without parole. Concurrence/ dissent at 907. Although these three states\u2019 treatment of similar crimes indicates that Washington is not alone in this area, the concurrence/dissent is correct that this Fain factor weighs in favor of a finding of disproportionality. However, this factor alone is not dispositive.\n\u00b626 The fourth Fain factor is the punishment meted out for other offenses in the same jurisdiction. Rivers, 129 Wn.2d at 714. In Washington, all adult offenders convicted of three \u201cmost serious offenses\u201d are sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of release under the POAA. In State v. Lee, we held that a life sentence imposed on a defendant convicted of robbery and found to be a habitual criminal was not cruel and unusual punishment. Id. (citing State v. Lee, 87 Wn.2d 932, 558 P.2d 236 (1976)). In that case, this court held, \u201c \u2018Appellant\u2019s sentence does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The life sentence contained in RCW 9.92.090 is not cumulative punishment for prior crimes. The repetition of criminal conduct aggravates the guilt of the last conviction and justifies a heavier penalty for the crime.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 714-15 (quoting Lee, 87 Wn.2d at 937). In Washington, \u201cmost serious offenses,\u201d including robbery, carry with them the sentence of life in prison without the possibility of release when the offender has a history of at least two other similarly serious offenses.\n\u00b627 Considering the four Fain factors, Witherspoon\u2019s sentence of life in prison without the possibility of release does not violate article I, section 14 of the Washington State Constitution or the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This court has repeatedly held that a life sentence after a conviction for robbery is neither cruel nor cruel and unusual. See id. at 715; State v. Manussier, 129 Wn.2d 652, 677, 921 P.2d 473 (1996) (a life sentence imposed for second degree robbery under POAA did not constitute cruel or cruel and unusual punishment where defendant\u2019s prior convictions were for first degree robbery); Lee, 87 Wn.2d at 937 (holding that a life sentence imposed for robbery under habitual criminal statute did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment where defendant\u2019s prior convictions were for robbery, two second degree burglaries, and second degree assault). Here, Witherspoon\u2019s earlier offenses were for first degree burglary and residential burglary with a firearm. The sentence of life in prison without the possibility of release for this third strike offense is proportionate to the crime.\n\u00b628 As noted, because we hold that Witherspoon\u2019s life sentence does not violate the Washington Constitution\u2019s prohibition on cruel punishment, we do not need to further analyze Witherspoon\u2019s sentence under the Eighth Amendment. However, Witherspoon claims that recent United States Supreme Court precedent regarding the Eighth Amendment prohibits life sentences for offenders in his position. This argument is entirely without merit.\n\u00b629 Witherspoon cites to Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 176 L. Ed. 2d 825 (2010), and Miller v. Alabama, _ U.S. _, 132 S. Ct. 2455, 183 L. Ed. 2d 407 (2012), for the proposition that a second degree robbery conviction cannot give rise to a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of release. He contends that the sentencing court must be able to reject such sentences when warranted by the pettiness of the offense or the characteristics of the offender. Graham and Miller are readily distinguishable and do not support such a claim.\n\u00b630 In Graham, 560 U.S. at 81, the United States Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of life sentences without the possibility of release on juvenile offenders who did not commit homicide. Two years later in Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2460, the Court held that mandatory sentencing of life without release for those under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amendment. In Miller, the Court noted that Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005), and Graham establish that children are constitutionally different from adults for sentencing purposes. Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2464. This line of cases has relied on three argued differences between children and adults: (1) children lack maturity and have an underdeveloped sense of responsibility that can lead to impulsivity and risk taking; (2) children are vulnerable to negative influences and have little control over their environments; and (3) children\u2019s characters are not well formed, meaning that their actions are less likely than adults\u2019 to be evidence of depravity. Id.\n\u00b631 Graham and Miller unmistakably rest on the differences between children and adults and the attendant propriety of sentencing children to life in prison without the possibility of release. Witherspoon was an adult when he committed all three of his strike offenses. These cases do not support Witherspoon\u2019s argument that all sentencing systems that mandate life in prison without the possibility of release for second degree robbery are per se invalid under the Eighth Amendment.\n\u00b632 Under our established precedent, along with that of the United States Supreme Court, Witherspoon\u2019s sentence violates neither article I, section 14 of our state constitution nor the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We accordingly affirm the Court of Appeals, upholding Witherspoon\u2019s POAA sentence.\n4. The Law Does Not Require That Witherspoon\u2019s Previous Strike Offenses Be Proved to a Jury beyond a Reasonable Doubt\n\u00b633 Witherspoon claims that previous strike offenses must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt within the context of sentencing under the POAA. He argues that prior convictions are elements of a crime when they elevate a class B felony to a third strike offense. Witherspoon concedes that Blakely contains an exception for prior convictions but contends that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Alleyne v. United States, _ U.S. _, 133 S. Ct. 2151, 186 L. Ed. 2d 314 (2013), eliminates justification for this exception. This argument fails.\n\u00b634 In Apprendi v. New Jersey the United States Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000) (emphasis added). Several years later in Blakely, 542 U.S. at 313-14, the United States Supreme Court held that sentencing above the statutory maximum of the standard range based on the sentencing judge\u2019s finding of deliberate cruelty violated a defendant\u2019s right to trial by jury under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the Court specifically noted, \u201cBy reversing the judgment below, we are not . . . \u2018finding] determinate sentencing schemes unconstitutional.\u2019 This case is not about whether determinate sentencing is constitutional, only about how it can be implemented in a way that respects the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 308 (second alteration in original) (citation omitted). Nowhere in Blakely did the Court question Apprendi\u2019s exception for prior convictions or the propriety of determinate sentencing schemes.\n\u00b635 Earlier this year, the United States Supreme Court again considered which facts must be proved to a jury under the Sixth Amendment if such facts may increase a criminal sentence. Alleyne, 133 S. Ct. 2151. The Court held that any fact that increases a mandatory minimum sentence for a crime is an element of the crime that must be submitted to the jury. Id. at 2155. Witherspoon argues that under Alleyne\u2019s reasoning, prior convictions must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt before they can be used to enhance a sentence. This is, however, incorrect. Like Blakely, nowhere in Alleyne did the Court question Apprendi\u2019s exception for prior convictions. It is improper for us to read this exception out of Sixth Amendment doctrine unless and until the United States Supreme Court says otherwise. Accordingly, Wither-spoon\u2019s argument that recent United States Supreme Court precedent dictates that his prior convictions must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is unsupported.\n\u00b636 We have long held that for the purposes of the POAA, a judge may find the fact of a prior conviction by a preponderance of the evidence. In Manussier, 129 Wn.2d at 681-84, we held that because other portions of the SRA utilize a preponderance standard, the appropriate standard for the POAA is by a preponderance of the evidence. We also held that the POAA does not violate state or federal due process by not requiring that the existence of prior strike offenses be decided by a jury. Id. at 682-83. This court has consistently followed this holding. We have repeatedly held that the right to jury determinations does not extend to the fact of prior convictions for sentencing purposes. See State v. McKague, 172 Wn.2d 802, 803 n.1, 262 P.3d 1225 (2011) (collecting cases); see also In re Pers. Restraint of Lavery, 154 Wn.2d 249, 256, 111 P.3d 837 (2005) (\u201cIn applying Apprendi, we have held that the existence of a prior conviction need not be presented to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); State v. Smith, 150 Wn.2d 135, 139, 75 P.3d 934 (2003) (prior convictions do not need to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt for the purposes of sentencing under the POAA).\n\u00b637 \u201cThe doctrine [of stare decisis] requires a clear showing that an established rule is incorrect and harmful before it is abandoned.\u201d In re Rights to Waters of Stranger Creek, 77 Wn.2d 649, 653, 466 P.2d 508 (1970). Witherspoon has not made such a showing. Accordingly, it is settled law in this state that the procedures of the POAA do not violate federal or state due process. Neither the federal nor state constitution requires that previous strike offenses be proved to a jury. Furthermore, the proper standard of proof for prior convictions is by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\u00b638 The State bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of prior convictions as predicate strike offenses for the purposes of the POAA. State v. Knippling, 166 Wn.2d 93, 100, 206 P.3d 332 (2009) (quoting In re Pers. Restraint of Cadwallader, 155 Wn.2d 867, 876, 123 P.3d 456 (2005)). In State v. Hunley, 175 Wn.2d 901, 915, 287 P.3d 584 (2012), this court held that \u201cconstitutional due process requires at least some evidence of the alleged convictions.\u201d Furthermore, \u201c \u2018[t]he best evidence of a prior conviction is a certified copy of the judgment.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 910 (quoting State v. Ford, 137 Wn.2d 472, 480, 973 P.2d 452 (1999)).\n\u00b639 Here, the trial court possessed certified copies of three judgments and sentences from Snohomish County. Exs. 2-4. Exhibit 3 showed the defendant had committed a residential burglary with a firearm, which is a most serious offense pursuant to RCW 9.94A.030(32)(t). Exhibit 4 demonstrated that the defendant had committed a first degree burglary, which is a most serious offense pursuant to RCW 9.94A.030(32)(a). The court noted at sentencing, \u201cI believe that it is the same person in light of the presentence investigation as well as the certified copy that\u2019s entered.\u201d Reporter\u2019s Tr. on Appeal (Sentencing) at 35. Accordingly, the State met its burden of proving two previous strike offenses by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\u00b640 United States Supreme Court precedent, as well as this court\u2019s own precedent, dictate that under the POAA, the State must prove previous convictions by a preponderance of the evidence and the defendant is not entitled to a jury determination on this issue. Here, based on certified copies of two judgments and sentences, the trial court determined that Witherspoon is a persistent offender and must be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of release. We affirm the Court of Appeals, upholding Witherspoon\u2019s POAA sentence.\nConclusion\n\u00b641 We affirm the Court of Appeals on all four issues accepted for review. First, there was sufficient evidence to support Witherspoon\u2019s second degree robbery conviction. Second, Witherspoon failed to meet his burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel on the grounds that he and his counsel tactically determined not to request a jury instruction on first degree theft as a lesser included offense, hoping for a not guilty verdict if the State failed to prove all elements of the greater offense. Third, Witherspoon\u2019s life sentence without the possibility of release does not constitute cruel or cruel and unusual punishment. Finally, the law does not require that Witherspoon\u2019s previous strike offenses be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We accordingly affirm the Court of Appeals, upholding the robbery conviction and the POAA life sentence without the possibility of release.\nMadsen, C.J., and C. Johnson, Owens, and Stephens, JJ., concur.\nJustice James M. Johnson is serving as a justice pro tempore of the Supreme Court pursuant to Washington Constitution article IV, section 2(a).\nThe Court of Appeals erred by stating that the challenged conviction was for second degree robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. See State v. Witherspoon, 171 Wn. App. 271, 280, 286 P.3d 996 (2012). The trial court never made a finding that Witherspoon was armed with a deadly weapon. See Clerk\u2019s Papers at 5. The presentence investigation report also contains this error. See Reporter\u2019s Tr. on Appeal (Sentencing) at 2 (identifying this inaccuracy and noting that the trial court did not rely on it for sentencing purposes).\nIn 2011, the legislature amended this statute to be gender neutral. This amendment did not affect the substance of the statute.\nState v. Magers, 164 Wn.2d 174, 193, 189 P.3d 126 (2008) (\u201c[T]he Court of Appeals has held that Blakely does not apply to sentencing under the POAA, Blakely being specifically directed at exceptional sentences. State v. Ball, 127 Wn. App. 956, 957, 959-60, 113 P.3d 520 (2005). We agree with this conclusion.\u201d).",

        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b642 (concurring and dissenting) \u2014 I agree that Alvin Witherspoon\u2019s conviction must be affirmed. There was certainly sufficient evidence to support his conviction of second degree robbery, despite the bravery of the victim in this case. The robbery statute focuses on the defendant\u2019s \u201cuse or threatened use\u201d of force, fear, etc., not on the courage of the victim in response. RCW 9A.56.190.\n\u00b643 In addition, following State v. Grier, 171 Wn.2d 17, 246 P.3d 1260 (2011), the ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails on this direct appeal: if Mr. Witherspoon seeks to prove that his lawyer\u2019s failure to ask for a lesser included offense instruction was something other than tactical, he must submit some evidence to prove it.\n\u00b644 I respectfully disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the sentence. The trial judge in this case \u2014 an experienced jurist \u2014 stated that life without parole was disproportionately harsh for Witherspoon\u2019s offense and that if he had any discretion to impose a lower sentence, he would have done so. The controlling Washington case interpreting the applicable provision of the Washington State Constitution is State v. Fain, 94 Wn.2d 387, 617 P.2d 720 (1980). Fain requires us to do just such a disproportionality analysis now, in reviewing the sentence.\n\u00b645 We should therefore subject Witherspoon\u2019s sentence to the four-factor disproportionality analysis this court adopted in Fain. Under that analysis, I conclude that Witherspoon\u2019s sentence \u2014 a mandatory term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the third \u201cstrike\u201d offense of second degree robbery \u2014 violates article I, section 14 of our state constitution. I therefore respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s holding on that issue.\nI. The Experienced Trial Judge Stated That He Would Not Have Imposed a Sentence of Life without the Possibility of Parole If He Was Not Required To Do So\n\u00b646 Witherspoon received his \u201cthird strike\u201d life sentence for a second degree robbery that is best described as inept. His victim attested to this at the sentencing hearing, where she exhorted him to pursue an interest to which he was better suited:\nI just would like to address Alvin ... because I really had a lot of sleepless nights over this and felt that... I wanted a fair and just sentence or whatever for him. And [I] felt really bad for him and talked to a lot of people about this and nobody seemed to really have any compassion for him whatsoever. I think I had more compassion for him than anybody. And then I learned that he just does this over and over and over again and he doesn\u2019t know anything else and I feel for his mom and his girlfriend and they stand behind him and he just keeps doing this over and over and he is a really lousy thief and he needs to know that he has other potential and that he could learn something else and he might not be so lucky next time, because I\u2019m damned if I\u2019m going to be the one dead. ... I hope you, Alvin, get some \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of opportunities in jail and that you should take every one of them, and find what you\u2019re good at, and it\u2019s not being a thief so find something else and something that you like is - probably something you\u2019re interested [in] is probably something that you\u2019re good at and I doubt if it\u2019s being a thief because you\u2019re [not] getting much out of it.\nReporter\u2019s Tr. on Appeal (TR) (Sentencing) at 37-38.\n\u00b647 I quote Ms. Pittario\u2019s statement at length not only because it captures the bumbling nature of Witherspoon\u2019s crime but also because it expresses her sincere belief that Mr. Witherspoon, who was 36 at the time, might reform.\n\u00b648 The trial judge who sentenced Witherspoon, the late Judge Craddock Verser, clearly shared this belief. His statement at sentencing, which I will also quote at length, leaves no doubt that were it not for the constraints imposed on him by the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA) of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), chapter 9.94A RCW, he would not have sentenced Wither-spoon to a life term:\nWhen I first started in this profession years ago in 1980, there was a prison and parole system and judges had discretion to send people to jail, prison, parole, a number of different discretionary possibilities at every sentencing and you could take something like this crime and look at it and go, okay, serious crime, it obviously affected Ms. Pittario. Nevertheless, is this the type of crime that you want to put somebody in prison for the rest of their life for. And, um, exercising discretion I wouldn\u2019t do that.\nI \u2014 over the last week, I - I\u2019ve never done a persistent offender sentencing, we just don\u2019t have that many in Jefferson County. Over the last week I looked at the statute and I was looking at the case law of what kind of discretion if any I had. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t have any discretion. I don\u2019t take any pleasure, Mr. Witherspoon, in sentencing you as a persistent offender. That\u2019s a choice that was made in the filing decision and the decision that went to trial. . . .\nThe arguments that I should arrest judgment are \u2014 quite frankly they were appealing to me. I said this young man is [36] years old ....\n... 7 didn\u2019t think you should go to prison the rest of your life and I don\u2019t mind putting that on the record but I have no discretion at all.\nTR (Sentencing) at 41-43 (emphasis added). This is an accurate statement of the law. Under Washington\u2019s persistent offender statute, the trial court had no discretion to sentence Witherspoon to anything other than life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. RCW 9.94A.570 (\u201c[n]otwithstanding the statutory maximum sentence or any other provision of this chapter, a persistent offender shall be sentenced to a term of total confinement for life without the possibility of release\u201d).\nII. For Purposes of Article I, Section 14 of the Washington State Constitution, Life without Parole Is a Harsher Penalty than Life with the Possibility of Parole; the Rivers Holding Ignores This Distinction and Is No Longer Good Law\n\u00b649 The majority rejects Witherspoon\u2019s article I, section 14 challenge primarily on the basis of this court\u2019s decisions in State v. Rivers, 129 Wn.2d 697, 921 P.2d 495 (1996), State v. Manussier, 129 Wn.2d 652, 677, 921 P.2d 473 (1996), and State v. Lee, 87 Wn.2d 932, 558 P.2d 236 (1976). In so doing, the majority errs.\n\u00b650 The first case on which the majority relies, Lee, 87 Wn.2d at 937, did not apply the Fain analysis at all because it predated Fain by four years. And the second case, Manussier, 129 Wn.2d at 678, declined to consider Fain\u2019s third factor: the punishment the defendant would have received in other jurisdictions. In this case, the majority concedes that this factor weighs in favor of finding that Witherspoon\u2019s sentence violated article I, section 14. Majority at 889.\n\u00b651 The final case on which the majority relies, Rivers, 129 Wn.2d at 714, applied the third Fain factor incorrectly. It relied on this court\u2019s decision in In re Personal Restraint of Grisby, 121 Wn.2d 419, 427, 853 P.2d 901 (1993), to conclude that life with and without the possibility of parole are indistinguishable for purposes of an article I, section 14 challenge. Rivers, 129 Wn.2d at 714. Thus, when the Rivers court considered what punishment Rivers would have received in other jurisdictions, it lumped together jurisdictions, like Washington, where the punishment was life without the possibility of parole, and jurisdictions where the punishment was life with the possibility of parole. 129 Wn.2d at 714 (\u201cThe penalties vary, but many include life sentences for three-time offenders. This court has held that the distinction between life sentences with and without parole is not significant.\u201d).\n\u00b652 By relying on Grisby this way, the Rivers court erred. To the extent that Grisby\u2019s holding applies at all to SRA convictions, it is strictly limited to the Sixth Amendment context. Grisby, 121 Wn.2d at 430 (\u201cThe case before us is not an Eighth Amendment case [but] rather [] a Sixth Amendment case relating to a defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial.\u201d); U.S. Const. amends. VI, VIII. The petitioner in Grisby argued that the statute under which he had been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole violated the Sixth Amendment because it penalized him for invoking his right to a jury trial. Grisby, 121 Wn.2d at 421. That statute imposed a maximum penalty of life without parole on a defendant convicted of aggravated murder following a jury trial, but a maximum of life with parole for a defendant who pleaded guilty. Id. This court rejected Grisby\u2019s Sixth Amendment argument on the basis that because parole is granted \u201c \u2018strictly by grace through the Board of Prison Terms and Paroles,\u2019 \u201d a defendant sentenced to life with the possibility of parole cannot actually expect to serve less than a life sentence. Id. at 426-27 (quoting State v. Frampton, 95 Wn.2d 469, 529, 627 P.2d 922 (1981) (Dimmick, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part)). That conclusion did not lead the Grisby court to hold that there is never a significant distinction between life with and without the possibility of parole. Rather, it led to the much narrower holding that the distinction was not significant enough to trigger the prohibition (under United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570, 583, 88 S. Ct. 1209, 20 L. Ed. 2d 138 (1968)) against \u201c \u2018needless encouragement of guilty pleas.\u2019 \u201d Grisby, 121 Wn.2d at 427 (quoting Frampton, 95 Wn.2d at 530 (Dimmick, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part)).\n\u00b653 Despite the narrowness of that holding and its limitation to the Sixth Amendment context, the Rivers majority relied on Grisby to conclude that life with and without the possibility of parole are indistinguishable for purposes of an article I, section 14 challenge. The court reached that conclusion without analyzing Grisby\u2019s relevance to article I, section 14 and Fain.\n\u00b654 This court has never expressly overruled Rivers\u2019 holding on the distinction between life with and without the possibility of parole. But it did so impliedly in State v. Thomas, 150 Wn.2d 821, 83 P.3d 970 (2004). Thomas held that there is a significant difference between life with and without the possibility of parole for purposes of the Apprendi rule. Id. at 847-48. After Thomas, a defendant convicted of murder under Washington\u2019s SRA cannot be sentenced to life without parole unless aggravating factors are found by a jury, because a \u201csentence of life without parole is an increased sentence as compared to life with the possibility of parole in capital cases.\u201d Id. at 848 (emphasis added).\n\u00b655 I would therefore not resolve Witherspoon\u2019s article I, section 14 argument by resurrecting Rivers \u2014 its application of the third Fain factor is no longer viable. To the extent Rivers held that there is no distinction between a sentence of life with and without parole, it is no longer good law. As this court acknowledged in Thomas, life without parole is a unique sentence, harsher and more punitive than life with the possibility of parole.\n\u00b656 Just as life without parole is harsher than life with parole, for purposes of article I, section 14, mandatory life without parole is harsher than discretionary life without parole. This is true as a factual matter: the trial judge in this case explicitly stated that he would not impose a life without parole sentence if it were not mandatory. It is also true as a legal matter; in Fain, we noted that \u201cWashington [was then] one of only three states which still retains a habitual criminal statute imposing a mandatory life sentence after any three felonies.\u201d Fain, 94 Wn.2d at 399 (emphasis added) (citing Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 279, 100 S. Ct. 1133, 63 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1980); id. at 296 (Powell, J., dissenting)); see also Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 996, 111 S. Ct. 2680, 115 L. Ed. 2d 836 (1991) (acknowledging that the petitioner\u2019s sentence \u2014 life without the possibility of parole \u2014 was \u201cunique in that it is the second most severe known to the law,\u201d more severe than discretionary life without parole).\n\u00b657 As a mandatory sentence of life without the possibility of parole, Witherspoon\u2019s sentence is almost as unusual as the sentence imposed in Fain. Of the 47 jurisdictions that have habitual offender statutes, only 5 (including Washington) would impose a mandatory sentence of life without parole for a third strike conviction of second degree robbery. See infra Part III.3.\nIII. A Mandatory Sentence of Life without Parole Is Disproportionate to the Offense of Second Degree Robbery Committed as a \u201cThird Strike\u201d; Wither-spoon\u2019s Sentence Thus Violates Article I, Section 14 of the Washington State Constitution\n\u00b658 The proportionality analysis this court adopted in Fain requires us to consider four factors in an article I, section 14 challenge: (1) the legislative purpose behind the challenged statute, (2) the nature of the defendant\u2019s offense, (3) the punishment the defendant would have received in other jurisdictions for the same offense, and (4) the punishment the defendant would have received in Washington for other offenses. Fain, 94 Wn.2d at 397 (citing Hart v. Coiner, 483 F.2d 136, 140-43 (4th Cir. 1973)). In light of these factors, a sentence of mandatory life without the possibility of parole violates article I, section 14 protections when imposed for a second degree robbery offense.\n1. Legislative purpose behind the POAA\n\u00b659 The POAA was enacted pursuant to popular initiative in 1993. Laws of 1994, ch. 1, \u00a7 2. Its statement of findings and intent identified four purposes served by the new law:\n(2) By sentencing three-time, most serious offenders to prison for life without the possibility of parole, the people intend to:\n(a) Improve public safety by placing the most dangerous criminals in prison.\n(b) Reduce the number of serious, repeat offenders by tougher sentencing.\n(c) Set proper and simplified sentencing practices that both the victims and persistent offenders can understand.\n(d) Restore public trust in our criminal justice system by directly involving the people in the process.\nId. \u00a7 1 (emphasis added).\n\u00b660 Washington\u2019s POAA was the nation\u2019s first \u201cthree strikes\u201d law; it was passed in the wake of several high profile and horrific crimes committed by repeat offenders. Proponents of the POAA were motivated by the belief that harsh sentencing laws would effectively deter and incapacitate the \u201crelatively small component of the offender population\u201d who posed the greatest danger to public safety.\n\u00b661 As we acknowledged in State v. Lee, habitual offender statutes in general, including the one that predated the POAA in Washington, serve punitive as well as preventative purposes: \u201c[t]he repetition of criminal conduct aggravates the guilt of the last conviction and justifies a heavier penalty for the crime.\u201d 87 Wn.2d 932, 937, 558 P.2d 236 (1976) (citing State v. Miles, 34 Wn.2d 55, 61-62, 207 P.2d 1209 (1949)); accord State v. Manussier, 129 Wn.2d 652, 677 n.108, 921 P.2d 473 (1996) (citing Lee, 87 Wn.2d at 937). But the POAA differs from the prior habitual offender statute in its imposition of mandatory life sentences without parole. Laws of 1994, ch. 1, \u00a7 2(4). The legislative history indicates that the primary impetus for this change was the desire to protect the public by incapacitating the most dangerous offenders.\n\u00b662 This factor would weigh in favor of upholding Witherspoon\u2019s sentence if he were in \u201cthe relatively small component of the offender population\u201d who are the most incorrigible, that is, the worst of the worst. But neither the victim nor the trial judge believed that he fell into that category. Thus, I cannot conclude that this factor weighs in favor of a finding of proportionality.\n2. Nature of Witherspoon\u2019s offense\n\u00b663 Witherspoon\u2019s two prior \u201cstrike\u201d convictions were for first degree burglary and residential burglary with a firearm; his third strike conviction was for second degree robbery. These are serious offenses \u2014 certainly more serious than the \u201cwholly nonviolent crimes involving small amounts of property\u201d at issue in Fain. 94 Wn.2d at 402.\n\u00b664 But Witherspoon\u2019s final offense stands in stark contrast to those triggering the harshest penalties under Washington\u2019s SRA. See infra Part III.4. As noted by the majority, Witherspoon\u2019s victim did not realize that Wither-spoon had retained any of her property until after Wither-spoon was already driving away from her house. Majority at 884. Because of that fact, the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals below concluded that Witherspoon had used stealth to accomplish the taking but had not employed the \u201cforce or fear\u201d necessary to a robbery conviction under RCW 9A.56.190. See State v. Witherspoon, 171 Wn. App. 271, 320, 286 P.3d 996 (2012) (Armstrong, J. Pro Tern., dissenting). Indeed, the dissent concluded that it was \u201clogically impossible\u201d to find that Witherspoon used \u201cforce or fear\u201d to prevent his victim from recovering her possessions, since Witherspoon was already leaving when the victim noticed that her possessions were in Witherspoon\u2019s car and since she was not in fact prevented from giving chase. Id. at 321 (\u201cIt is logically impossible to find that Pittario had the will to retain or recover property that she did not know had been stolen. And the State offered no evidence that Witherspoon made any threat that Pittario should not follow them. Pittario testified that she was not afraid, and, in fact, she gave chase.\u201d).\n\u00b665 I agree with the majority that the State need not prove the victim\u2019s actual, subjective fear in order to sustain a robbery conviction, and I therefore disagree with the conclusion of the dissent below. But the fact that the State need not prove actual fear to sustain a robbery conviction shows how broadly the robbery statute sweeps. In Washington, as in many other states, a person can commit the crime of second degree robbery by means of brutal assault or \u2014 as in Witherspoon\u2019s case \u2014 by an \u201cimplied threat\u201d that the victim seems to have regarded as more confusing than frightening. Majority at 885; TR (Trial Day 1) at 42-49 (Pittario testimony). Thus, the nature of a second degree robbery offense may vary significantly from case to case.\n\u00b666 Outside the POAA context, a court can consider the facts underlying a robbery conviction when imposing a sentence. It may impose a sentence anywhere within the standard sentence range; it may also depart from the standard range if mitigating circumstances are established. RCW 9.94A.535(1). This discretion is a crucial means of avoiding sentences that are \u201cclearly excessive in light of the [SRA\u2019s] purpose [s],\u201d id. \u00a7 (1)(g), which include ensuring that punishments are both \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cproportionate to the seriousness of the offense,\u201d RCW 9.94A.010(2), (1).\n\u00b667 Under the POAA, a court lacks that discretion. In this case, the result is severe: a defendant who neither injured nor frightened his victim received a sentence generally reserved for society\u2019s most violent and predatory offenders. Thus, I cannot conclude that the nature of the offense factor weighs in favor of upholding this sentence under Fain\u2019s second factor.\n\u00b668 In fact, lack of discretion to depart from a habitual offender sentence is frequently cited by critics of habitual offender statutes. It has prompted courts in several jurisdictions to adopt sentencing procedures specifically designed to prevent the mandatory imposition of excessive punishments under recidivist statutes. Indeed, courts have done so in two of the three states with habitual offender statutes equivalent to Washington\u2019s.\n\u00b669 As noted \u00e1bove, Washington\u2019s POAA was enacted mainly in response to public safety concerns: it was designed to ensure that dangerous, violent offenders would be permanently segregated from society. Applied mechanically, the statute can exceed this purpose.\n3. Punishment in other jurisdictions for second degree robbery as a \u201cthird strike\u201d offense\n\u00b670 As noted above, Witherspoon\u2019s sentence is almost as rare as the sentence this court overturned in Fain. Outside of Washington, there are only three states in which a conviction of second degree robbery as a \u201cthird strike\u201d offense triggers a mandatory sentence of life without parole. In the vast majority of jurisdictions with habitual offender statutes \u2014 34 out of 48 \u2014 such a conviction would result in a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years or less. Six states impose a mandatory minimum of 25 years or less for a third strike offense comparable to Witherspoon\u2019s.\n\u00b671 This Fain factor clearly weighs in favor of a finding of disproportionality.\n4. Punishment in Washington for other offenses\n\u00b672 In the non-POAA context, Washington punishes only one crime with a sentence of mandatory life without parole: aggravated first degree murder. RCW 9.94A.510, .515. Aggravated first degree murder is a level 16 offense, the highest \u201cseriousness level\u201d in the SRA. RCW 9.94A.515. The next most serious level of offense, level 15, includes homicide by abuse and nonaggravated first degree murder. RCW 9.94A.515. In the non-POAA context, a person convicted of those crimes might serve as little as 20 years \u2014 far less than life without parole.\n\u00b673 In the non-POAA context, Washington imposes mandatory minimum sentences for only five offenses: aggravated and nonaggravated first degree murder, first degree assault involving \u201cforce or means likely to result in death or intended to kill the victim,\u201d rape in the first degree, and sexually violent predator escape. RCW 9.94A.540(1)(b)-(d). A person convicted of first degree murder faces a 20-year mandatory minimum, while a person convicted of first degree rape, first degree assault, or sexually violent predator escape faces a mandatory minimum of 5 years. Id. For every other offense, the court may impose a sentence below the standard sentence range if \u201cmitigating circumstances are established by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d RCW 9.94A.535.\n\u00b674 The gravity of Witherspoon\u2019s third strike offense must not be understated; it was deliberate, and the fact that his victim exhibited uncommon courage during the offense and extraordinary compassion thereafter does not minimize the crime. But neither should that offense be amplified beyond all recognition. To punish it with a sentence greater than that imposed for the most brutal crimes\u2014 homicide, first degree assault, and first degree rape \u2014 is to disregard two central purposes of the SRA: justice and proportionality. RCW 9.94A.010(1), (2).\n\u00b675 Thus, this final Fain factor also weighs in favor of a finding of disproportionality.\n5. The proper remedy for the constitutional violation in this case is remand for resentencing under the SRA guidelines\n\u00b676 For the reasons given in the analysis above, RCW 9.94A.570 is unconstitutional as applied to the particular second degree robbery in this case. Article I, section 14 of the Washington Constitution does not permit the imposition of mandatory life without parole \u2014 the harshest penalty short of death- \u2014 on a second degree robber whose victim testified that he neither frightened nor threatened her. Because the POAA is unconstitutional as applied to Witherspoon, the proper remedy is to remand for resentencing under the SRA guidelines \u2014 without the application of the POAA. State v. Hunley, 175 Wn.2d 901, 916, 287 P.3d 584 (2012) (holding a statute unconstitutional as applied does not render it completely inoperable; rather, it prohibits the future application of the statute in a similar context).\n\u00b677 At Witherspoon\u2019s original sentencing hearing, the State characterized its charging decision as \u201csuspenders and belt.\u201d TR (Sentencing) at 30. The State is correct. Its second degree robbery charge also included the aggravating factor that \u201c[t]he defendant has committed multiple current offenses and the defendant\u2019s high offender score results in some of the current offenses going unpunished.\u201d RCW 9.94A.535(2)(c). That statute places the determination of whether that aggravating factor exists, and whether it supports a sentence above the standard range, in the hands of the judge. Id. At the original sentencing, where the judge felt compelled to impose life without parole, the judge had no reason to address that aggravating factor. The court is free to address it at resentencing.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b678 The question before us in this case is narrow. We are asked whether it is unconstitutional to force a trial court judge to impose a mandatory sentence of life without parole on a defendant whose third \u201cstrike\u201d is a second degree robbery committed in a manner that did not cause physical harm or actual fear. The answer to that question is yes.\n\u00b679 This answer is based on the legal description of the crime of second degree robbery (RCW 9A.56.190), the facts of its accomplishment in this case, and the mandatory nature of the penalty.\n\u00b680 We have not been asked to rule on whether it would be unconstitutional to sentence a defendant to life without parole for a different crime, or for this crime committed in a different manner. The remedy I would impose is therefore particular to this case. The legislature, not this court, is the body with the power to draft a procedure that would be constitutional in all cases. I express no opinion as to what sort of procedure might comply with article I, section 14 protections. Pursuant to the Fain analysis conducted above, I conclude only that the current procedure, according to which a sentencing judge has no discretion to impose a sentence lower than life without parole, does not comply with state constitutional requirements. A different procedure certainly would.\nFairhurst, Wiggins, and Gonz\u00e1lez, JJ., concur with Gordon McCloud, J.\nAPPENDIX OF \u201cPERSISTENT OFFENDER\u201d LAWS\nI note that State v. Thomas explicitly distinguishes Grisby as a \u201cpre-Sentencing Reform Act. . . case.\u201d 150 Wn.2d 821, 848, 83 P.3d 970 (2004).\nNotably, the Ninth Circuit granted Mr. Grisby\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging that sentencing decision and compelled the State to resentence him, precisely because it rejected our decision that there is no constitutional distinction between life with and without parole. Grisby v. Blodgett, 130 F.3d 365, 369-70 (9th Cir. 1997) (noting that federal precedent \u201cestablishes that, as a matter of law, a sentence of life without the possibility of parole is significantly different from a sentence of life with the possibility of parole\u201d for purposes of the Jackson decision).\nRivers, 129 Wn.2d at 714 (\u201cThis court has held that the distinction between life sentences with and without parole is not significant.\u201d (citing Grisby, 121 Wn.2d at 427)). In Fain, the State urged this court to proceed as if Jimmy Fain had not actually received a life sentence, since \u201cthe availability of parole and \u2018good behavior\u2019 credits\u201d created \u201ca likelihood\u201d that Fain would actually serve far less than a lifetime behind bars. Fain, 94 Wn.2d at 393 (citing RCW 9.95.110, .070). We declined this invitation on the ground that a prisoner \u201chas no right to parole, which is merely a privilege granted by [an] administrative body.\u201d Id. at 394 (citing January v. Porter, 75 Wn.2d 768, 774, 453 P.2d 876 (1969)).\nUnder the Apprendi rule, \u201cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000).\nWhile the Thomas decision alone precludes the majority\u2019s reliance on Grisby and Rivers to reject Witherspoon\u2019s article I, section 14 challenge, it should be noted that that reliance is also inconsistent with United States Supreme Court precedent. In Graham v. Florida, the Court concluded that for purposes of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishments, the sentence of life without parole has severe and punitive characteristics distinguishing it from a sentence of life with the possibility of parole. 560 U.S. 48, 69, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 176 L. Ed. 2d 825 (2010) (\u201cThe State does not execute the offender sentenced to life without parole, but the sentence alters the offender\u2019s life by a forfeiture that is irrevocable.\u201d). The Graham holding rested on those characteristics \u2014 not, as the majority would have it, on \u201cthe differences between children and adults,\u201d majority at 890 \u2014 and on prior Eighth Amendment cases in which \u201cthe severity of sentences that deny convicts the possibility of parole\u201d played an integral part in the Court\u2019s decision. 560 U.S. at 69-70 (citing Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 100 S. Ct. 1133, 63 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1980); Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 103 S. Ct. 3001, 77 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1983)). In short, Graham unambiguously holds that the sentence of life without parole is more severe, for purposes of the Eighth Amendment, than the sentence of life with the possibility of parole.\nAs the majority acknowledges, article I, section 14 of the Washington Constitution is more protective of individual rights than the Eighth Amendment. Majority at 887 (citing Fain, 94 Wn.2d at 392). It follows that article I, section 14 must recognize the unique severity of life without parole. It cannot be that our more protective constitutional provision would fail to account for \u201charshness\u201d that is dispositive in Eighth Amendment cases. Graham, 560 U.S. at 70.\nIn Harmelin, the majority rejected the argument that the Eighth Amendment requires a sentencing court to exercise discretion (to consider mitigating or aggravating circumstances) before imposing a sentence of life without parole. 501 U.S. at 994-95; id. at 1004 (Kennedy, J., concurring). The Court rejected that argument, however, because it declined to apply a proportionality analysis to the petitioner\u2019s sentence. Id. at 994-95. In Fain, this court adopted the proportionality analysis endorsed by the dissenters in Harmelin. For purposes of that analysis, a mandatory sentence is more severe than a sentence that permits the trial court to consider the individual circumstances of a defendant\u2019s offense.\nJennifer Cox Shapiro, Comment, Life in Prison for Stealing $48?: Rethinking Second-Degree Robbery as a Strike Offense in Washington State, 34 Seattle U.

See App. There was certainly some decision-making involved in my choice of sister-state robbery statutes to use in the appendix. I chose sister-state statutes with elements most nearly identical to the crime of which Mr. Witherspoon was convicted. That crime was second degree robbery in violation of RCW 9A.56.200 and .190, with no aggravating factor alleged (other than the \u201cfree crimes\u201d factor, see RCW 9.94A-.535(2)(c)), which does not relate to the manner in which the robbery was committed).\nI believe this is the required comparison for three reasons. First, it comports with Washington\u2019s case law on \u201ccomparability under the SRA, which limits the comparability analysis to facts/elements actually admitted to or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Thiefault, 160 Wn.2d 409, 414-15, 158 P.3d 580 (2007); In re Pers. Restraint of Lavery, 154 Wn.2d 249, 258, 111 P.3d 837 (2005). Second, it is consistent with the comparison undertaken in Fain, 94 Wn.2d at 399-400: a statute-to-statute, elements-based comparison. Third, as discussed in State v. Olsen, 180 Wn.2d 468, 825 P.3d 187 (2014), the problems inherent in comparing factual allegations, rather than proven factual elements, are virtually insurmountable when evaluating other states\u2019 crimes.\nNevertheless, if I had compared certain uncharged facts underlying the State\u2019s theory of how Witherspoon committed his third \u201cstrike\u201d offense \u2014 the theory that this was a robbery based on a verbal threat involving a nonexistent gun \u2014 the results under the third Fain factor would be similar. That comparison would add only three states to the list of jurisdictions that punish unarmed robbery as a third strike with mandatory life without parole. (These are Delaware, New Jersey, and Wisconsin. Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7\u00a7 832(a)(2), 4214(b); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2C:15-1(a)(1), (b), 2C:43-7.1(b)(2); Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 939.62(2m)(a)(2m), 943.32(2).)\nThere are 31 jurisdictions in which a third strike conviction for second degree robbery triggers an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years or less. See App. These are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Washington, DC, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and Montana. Id. Montana imposes a mandatory life sentence on recidivist offenders in most cases, but not where (as in Witherspoon\u2019s case) injury or threat of injury is an element of the third strike offense but no injury to the victim actually occurs. Id. In those cases, the sentence is discretionary. Id. In four other states (Delaware, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Vermont), habitual offender statutes exist but are not triggered by a third strike conviction for second degree robbery. Id.\nThese are California, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and Oklahoma. See id.\nFor a defendant with no criminal history, the standard range sentence for homicide by abuse or nonaggravated murder is 240-320 months. RCW 9.94A.510. For a defendant with two violent prior offenses, the standard range sentence is 281-374 months. Id.; RCW 9.94A.525(9) (if present conviction is for a serious violent offense, count two points for each prior violent conviction and one point for each prior nonviolent felony conviction).\nOther states have taken a variety of approaches to the problem of disproportionate sentencing in the \u201cthree strikes\u201d context \u2014 there are no doubt multiple ways this problem could be resolved. In at least four states, persons convicted under habitual offender statutes are automatically entitled to a constitutional proportionality review upon sentencing. See supra note 16 (explaining sentencing procedures in Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, and West Virginia). In one state, third strike offenders receive mandatory life sentences in most cases but not where (as in Witherspoon\u2019s case) injury or threat of injury is an element of the third strike offense but no injury to the victim actually occurs. Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-219(1)(b), 46-18-222. In those cases, the sentence is discretionary. Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-18-222. See also supra note 19, discussing the various penalties less harsh than mandatory life without parole, which are imposed for third strike second degree robbery convictions in the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions.\nSee State v.

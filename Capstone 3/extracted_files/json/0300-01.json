        "text": "[As amended by order of the Supreme Court November 23, 2015.]\nStephens, J.\n\u00b6 1 Plaintiff Ericka Rickman brought this suit against her former employer, Premera Blue Cross, for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Rickman alleges she was terminated in retaliation for raising concerns about potential violations of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936, and its Washington counterpart, the Uniform Health Care Information Act (UHCIA), ch. 70.02 RCW. The trial court dismissed Rick-man\u2019s suit on Premera\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding Rickman could not satisfy the jeopardy element of the tort because Premera\u2019s internal reporting system provides an adequate alternative means to promote the public policy. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Rickman v. Premera Blue Cross, noted at 183 Wn. App. 1015 (2014).\n\u00b62 We granted review of this case and two others in order to resolve confusion with respect to the jeopardy element of the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Rickman v. Premera Blue Cross, 182 Wn.2d 1009, 343 P.3d 759 (2015); see also Becker v. Cmty. Health Sys., Inc., 182 Wn.2d 1009, 343 P.3d 759 (2015); Rose v. Anderson Hay & Grain Co., 182 Wn.2d 1009, 343 P.3d 759 (2015). Consistent with our decisions in Rose v. Anderson Hay & Grain Co., 184 Wn.2d 268, 358 P.3d 1139 (2015) and Becker v. Community Health Systems, Inc., 184 Wn.2d 252, 359 P.3d 746 (2015), we hold that nothing in Premera\u2019s internal reporting system, nor in HIPAA or its Washington counterpart UHCIA, precludes Rickman\u2019s claim of wrongful discharge. We reverse the Court of Appeals but remand for that court to address Premera\u2019s alternate argument for upholding the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\u00b63 Ericka Rickman served as director of Ucentris Insured Solutions from August 2004 until her termination in November 2009. Ucentris, a subsidiary of Premera, is a general insurance agency that sells a variety of health care insurance plans and risk management products to individuals and businesses. Two distinct events transpired relevant to Rickman\u2019s termination.\nHIPAA Concerns\n\u00b64 In mid-September 2009, Rickman learned about a likely merger between Pacific Benefits Trust (PBT), a large association underwritten by Premera, and Washington Grocers Trust, another association underwritten by another insurer. As a result of the potential merger, Premera would lose PBT membership. Rickman confirmed the merger with Robin Hilleary, director of Premera\u2019s small business group. Rickman informed Hilleary that a Ucentris client asked a Ucentris \u201c[c]aptive agent\u201d to look for non-Premera insurance in light of the merger. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 187. In response, Hilleary said Premera was putting together a strategy to retain membership and Rickman should advise Ucentris captive agents not to look elsewhere for insurance on behalf of clients. Hilleary told Rickman that Premera planned to use Ucentris captive agents to transfer the memberships of preferred groups from the merged associations into an association underwritten by Premera. Id.\n\u00b65 Rickman had a \u201cgut feeling\u201d the proposed plan involved \u201crisk bucketing,\u201d i.e., separating riskier policy holders from less risky holders for underwriting, which she believed might violate HIPAA laws. CP at 271-72, 187. Rickman believed the plan could disclose private policyholder information. Rickman expressed her concerns to her supervisor Rick Grover:\nI met with Rick and I said, \u201cRick, I have a concern about a strategy that may be going on within Premera.\u201d I explained I didn\u2019t know the details other than it had a potential utilization of our agents to move membership!,] and it had HIPAA written all over it. I couldn\u2019t say that was illegal because I don\u2019t know actually what\u2019s going to happen, but we did not want to be a part of it.\nCP at 271. Rickman suggested to Grover the plan should be reviewed by a superior to determine its legality. Grover refused, noting that \u201cwe don\u2019t always tell everything to [the supervisor].\u201d CP at 188. Rickman told Grover this is the way she had always done her business, but he said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a new Sheriff in town.\u201d Id. Later, Grover forwarded e-mails to Rickman that confirmed Premera was contemplating a risk bucketing plan, which Rickman believed would violate HIPAA. Rickman reported her concerns only to Grover and did not file a complaint with Premera\u2019s compliance and ethics department.\n\u00b66 Several days after Rickman voiced her HIPAA concerns to Grover, he abandoned the risk bucketing plan, reasoning the plan favored Ucentris over Premera\u2019s other distribution channels. Premera\u2019s underwriting department later determined the risk bucketing plan was not illegal. However, in response to Rickman\u2019s interrogatories, Premera answered, \u201cThe group quickly determined that risk bucketing was not a lawful option for that particular situation.\u201d CP at 67 (emphasis added).\nConflict of Interest Concerns\n\u00b67 Rickman\u2019s son, Taylor Vidor, had been a captive agent for Ucentris since 2005, working as an independent contractor. Before Vidor was retained, Rickman disclosed her relationship with Vidor to her former supervisor, who approved hiring Vidor. According to Rickman, her former supervisor said Rickman did not need to make further disclosures because \u201c \u2018hit\u2019s not an issue. He\u2019s a contractor.\u2019 \u201d CP at 260. Rickman also disclosed her relationship to a former employee in human resources, but the employee never responded, and human resources has no record of the conversation. Rickman did not otherwise disclose her relationship in her annual conflict questionnaires, to her new supervisor Grover, or to the compliance and ethics department. Rickman testified that many other Premera employees have family members who work for or contract with Premera.\n\u00b68 In 2008, Rickman approved the promotion of Vidor from a captive agent to a \u201c[s]ubject [m]atter [e] xpert [ ]\u201d (SME), at the recommendation of Ucentris managers. CP at 182-83, 261-62. Vidor received additional compensation as an SME. When another SME stepped down, Vidor assumed his workload and Rickman approved an increase in Vidor\u2019s commission from 5 to 10 percent, twice the amount some other SMEs received. Rickman did not consult with Pre-mera or further disclose her potential conflict of interest.\n\u00b69 On September 11, 2009, around the same time Rick-man raised her HIPAA concerns, someone filed an anonymous complaint against Rickman with the compliance and ethics department, alleging a conflict of interest existed because of her son\u2019s involvement with Ucentris. The complaint highlighted that Rickman had elevated Vidor to an SME position, that Vidor had input on which captive agents received leads, and that the general feeling in the office was that befriending Vidor curried favor with Rickman.\n\u00b610 Nancy Ferrara investigated the complaint and ultimately recommended Rickman be terminated. Ferrara concluded that Rickman\u2019s actions created the appearance of favoritism by condoning familial relationships at Premera and that Rickman did not properly disclose her relationship to compliance and ethics or human resources, especially before approving Vidor\u2019s SME promotion and increasing his commission. Ferrara also concluded Rickman exercised poor judgment and showed a lack of integrity because she was not forthcoming during the investigation. In her 2013 deposition, Ferrara later said she had no knowledge of Rickman\u2019s HIPAA concerns during the investigation or at the time of her recommendation. Grover stated he agreed with Ferrara\u2019s recommendation, and he terminated Rick-man in November 2009. There is some question, however, whether Grover and Ferrara had different reasons for Rickman\u2019s termination.\nProcedural Background\n\u00b611 In December 2010, Rickman filed suit against Premera in Snohomish County Superior Court, alleging Premera had wrongfully discharged her in violation of public policy. Premera moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The court found the clarity element of the tort of wrongful discharge was readily established based on HIPAA and Washington\u2019s UHCIA. However, the court ruled that Rickman failed to identify a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the jeopardy and absence of justification elements of her claim. As to the jeopardy element, the court held that Rickman could not establish that other means of promoting the public policy were inadequate because Premera had a robust internal reporting system. Relying on Dicomes v. State, 113 Wn.2d 612, 782 P.2d 1002 (1989), the court further held that Rickman acted unreasonably by failing to apprise herself of the details of the risk bucketing plan to determine whether it was in fact illegal, and that public policy was not in jeopardy because Premera did not implement the plan.\n\u00b612 As to absence of justification, the court found that Ferrara\u2019s recommendation to terminate Rickman was made without knowledge of Rickman\u2019s HIPAA concern. Therefore, the court reasoned Rickman failed to show a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether she was fired for raising HIPAA concerns. Rickman appealed.\n\u00b613 The Court of Appeals affirmed. Rickman, No. 70766-3-1, slip op. at 15 (Wash. Ct. App. May 9, 2016) (unpublished), http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/70766-3.pdf. The court reasoned Rickman failed to satisfy the jeopardy element for two reasons. First, the court held that Premera\u2019s internal reporting \u201csystem provided an available adequate alternative means by which Rickman could have reported her concerns.\u201d Id. Relying on Cudney v. ALSCO, Inc., 172 Wn.2d 524, 259 P.3d 244 (2011), the court said the jeopardy element is unconcerned with whether Premera\u2019s internal reporting system provided Rickman any remedy for termination postreporting. Rickman, slip op. at 14. Second, the court held Rickman could not establish that her alleged whistle-blowing activity was protected because she failed to report her concerns in a reasonable manner, not having confirmed the facts or illegality of the plan. The court did not address causation or absence of justification. Rickman petitioned to this court for review, which we granted. Rickman, 182 Wn.2d 1009.\nANALYSIS\n\u00b614 Our decisions in the companion cases of Rose and Becker recognize that the strict adequacy analysis this court has sometimes embraced is inconsistent with the history and purpose of the tort of wrongful discharge. Rose, 184 Wn.2d at 286; Becker, 184 Wn.2d at 258; see, e.g., Thompson v. St. Regis Paper Co., 102 Wn.2d 219, 232, 685 P.2d 1081 (1984). Those decisions announce a return to Thompson, in which we adopted the public policy tort in recognition that the at-will doctrine gives employers potentially \u201cunfettered control of the workplace and, thus, allows the employer to take unfair advantage of its employees.\u201d Thompson, 102 Wn.2d at 226. Thompson observed that allowing an exception to the at-will doctrine serves to equalize the imbalance of power that exists in an employment relationship. Id. Our adoption of the common law tort thus signified that the at-will doctrine can no longer \u201cbe used to shield an employer\u2019s action which otherwise frustrates a clear manifestation of public policy.\u201d Id. at 231.\n\u00b615 Thompson characterized the public policy tort as \u201cnarrow,\u201d meaning the employee has the burden of proving the dismissal violates a clear mandate of public policy. Id. at 232. This means \u201ca court may not sua sponte manufacture public policy but rather must rely on that public policy previously manifested in the constitution, a statute, or a prior court decision.\u201d Roberts v. Dudley, 140 Wn.2d 58, 65, 993 P.2d 901 (2000); see also Thompson, 102 Wn.2d at 232 (noting we determine the public policy from \u201c \u2018the letter or purpose of a constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provision or scheme\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018[p]rior judicial decisions\u2019 \u201d (quoting Parnar v. Americana Hotels, Inc., 65 Haw. 370, 652 P.2d 625, 631 (1982))).\n\u00b616 In the years immediately following Thompson, the tort of wrongful discharge became the subject of an academic treatise by Professor Henry Perritt. See Henry H. Perritt, Jr., Workplace Torts: Rights and Liabilities \u00a7 3.14, at 75-76 (1991). In Gardner, we looked to Professor Perritt\u2019s treatise to embrace \u201ca more refined\u201d analysis, in light of the unusual facts of that case. Gardner v. Loomis Armored, Inc., 128 Wn.2d 931, 940, 913 P.2d 377 (1996). The Perritt test segments its analysis into four parts: (1) \u201cthe existence of a clear public policy (the clarity element),\u201d (2) \u201cthat discouraging the conduct in which the [plaintiff] engaged would jeopardize the public policy (the jeopardy element),\u201d (3) \u201cthat the public-policy-linked conduct caused the dismissal (the causation element),\u201d and (4) that \u201c[t]he defendant [has not] offer[ed] an overriding justification for the dismissal [of the plaintiff] (the absence of justification element).\u201d Id. at 941.\n\u00b617 Gardner recognized a plaintiff may prove \u201cjeopardy\u201d either because his or her conduct directly relates to the public policy or because it was necessary for the effective enforcement of that policy. Id. at 945; see also Korslund v. DynCorp Tri-Cities Servs., Inc., 156 Wn.2d 168, 193-95, 125 P.3d 119 (2005) (Chambers, J., dissenting) (describing Gardner); Cudney, 172 Wn.2d at 540 (Stephens, J., dissenting in part) (same). In Rose and Becker, we clarified that the jeopardy analysis appropriately considers whether available alternative remedies are intended to be exclusive but does not require an employee to prove that bringing a tort claim is strictly necessary to vindicate public policy. Rose, 184 Wn.2d at 282, 286; Becker, 184 Wn.2d at 258; see also Wilmot v. Kaiser Alum. & Chem. Corp., 118 Wn.2d 46, 53-66, 821 P.2d 18 (1981) (analysis focuses on whether the alternate adequate enforcement mechanism is mandatory or exclusive); Hubbard v. Spokane County, 146 Wn.2d 699, 717, 50 P.3d 602 (2002) (finding zoning code inadequate remedy due to its short statute of limitations); Smith v. Bates Tech. Coll., 139 Wn.2d 793, 811, 991 P.2d 1135 (2000) (finding Public Employment Relations Commission inadequate to vindicate public policy).\n\u00b618 The courts below dismissed Rickman\u2019s tort claim based on the strict adequacy standard of proof we abandoned in Rose and Becker. We must now consider whether her claim survives under the more traditional analysis of Thompson and Gardner.\nRickman Establishes Genuine Issues of Material Fact as to Jeopardy\n\u00b619 \u201cWe review de novo a trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment.\u201d Lakey v. Puget Sound Energy, Inc., 176 Wn.2d 909, 922, 296 P.3d 860 (2013). We affirm an order of summary judgment only when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See CR 56(c); Qwest Corp. v. City of Bellevue, 161 Wn.2d 353, 358, 166 P.3d 667 (2007). We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor. CR 56(c); Qwest Corp., 161 Wn.2d at 358.\n\u00b620 As noted, a plaintiff establishes the jeopardy prong by demonstrating either of the following: \u201chis or her conduct was . . . [(1)] directly related to the public policy or [(2)] necessary for effective enforcement.\u201d Rose, 184 Wn.2d at 284. Premera asks us to treat its internal code of conduct (Code) the same way we treat statutes for purposes of the jeopardy analysis. Premera argues the Code\u2019s internal reporting system provides an adequate alternate means to enforce public policy. We reject Premera\u2019s position.\n\u00b621 Premera has not presented, nor could we locate, any authority for the proposition that a private employer\u2019s workplace policy should be accorded equal status to a duly enacted statute. There are obvious differences between internal self-regulations and a statutorily mandated system for addressing public policy violations. We reject Pre-mera\u2019s argument that its internal reporting system should be the sole avenue to address violations of public policy in its workplace.\n\u00b622 We also reject Premera\u2019s argument that HIPAA and Washington\u2019s UHCIA adequately protect public policy. First, Premera does not argue that any available remedies under the statutes are exclusive. See Rose, 184 Wn.2d at 286-87; Becker, 184 Wn.2d at 258. Second, Rickman claims she helped prevent an illegal risk-bucketing scheme, not that one occurred in violation of federal and state law. It is not clear that HIPAA or Washington\u2019s UHCIA contemplate remedies where a discharged employee thwarts an unlawful act. A complaint may be filed with the secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights when a person believes a covered business is \u201cnot complying\u201d with HIPAA. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.306(a); see also id. at (b)(2) (complaint must \u201cdescribe the acts or omissions believed to be in violation\u201d). Similarly, Washington\u2019s UHCIA provides enforcement and remedies when a health care provider \u201chas not complied\u201d with the law. RCW 70.02.170(1).\n\u00b623 In addition to considering the adequacy of alternate means available to enforce public policy, the trial court found Rickman could not meet the jeopardy prong because she did not show her actions were reasonable. The trial court relied on language in Dicomes that predates Gardner. Premera argues this Dicomes-based analysis is a \u201cthreshold assessment\u201d for the tort of wrongful discharge. Suppl. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 7-8. We disagree. Dicomes does not provide a litmus test for a claim of wrongful discharge. We have never adopted as an element of the four-part Perritt test, or of wrongful discharge generally, a requirement that the plaintiff confirm the validity of his or her concerns before taking action.\n\u00b624 Instead, the reasonableness of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct relates to whether the plaintiff\u2019s conduct furthers public policy goals. See Gardner, 128 Wn.2d at 945 (finding employees must show \u201cthey engaged in particular conduct,\u201d which \u201cdirectly relates to the public policy\u201d); Thompson, 102 Wn.2d at 232 (finding the employee must demonstrate the dismissal violates a clear mandate of public policy). This inquiry may be satisfied by showing \u201cthe employee sought to further the public good, and not merely private or proprietary interests.\u201d Dicomes, 113 Wn.2d at 620. Compare Bennett v. Hardy, 113 Wn.2d 912, 924-25, 784 P.2d 1258 (1990) (allowing a claim when the employee hired an attorney to protect herself from discrimination, an act for which she was later fired), with Farnam v. CRISTA Ministries, 116 Wn.2d 659, 672, 807 P.2d 830 (1991) (finding the employee did not seek to further the public good because she knew the employer\u2019s conduct did not violate the law).\n\u00b625 Rickman has presented sufficient evidence to find she acted in furtherance of public policy. She believed Premera\u2019s risk-bucketing plan would disclose the private information of policyholders, violating a clear mandate of public policy under HIPAA. Following Premera\u2019s workplace rules, Rickman reported her concern to her supervisor, Grover. CP at 271, 314 (Premera\u2019s Code expects associates to report suspected violations of any applicable laws to their supervisors.). Her supervisor told her to disregard her concerns. Viewing the facts of this case in the light most favorable to Rickman, she did not act unreasonably or raise the concerns to benefit her private or proprietary interests. We reverse the Court of Appeals decision insofar as it affirmed dismissal of Rickman\u2019s public policy tort for failing to establish the jeopardy element.\n\u00b626 The Court of Appeals did not address the trial court\u2019s separate reason for granting summary judgment. The trial court agreed with Premera that Rickman failed to meet her burden of production on the absence of justification element of her claim. Premera argues there is no genuine issue of material fact that Rickman\u2019s discharge was the result of her conflict of interest or poor judgment involving her son\u2019s position. This argument seems to blend the separate issues of causation and overriding justification, as it focuses on whether Rickman\u2019s HIPAA concerns were the real reason for her termination.\n\u00b627 We recognize that causation in a wrongful discharge claim is not an all or nothing proposition. The employee \u201cneed not attempt to prove the employer\u2019s sole motivation was retaliation.\u201d Wilmot, 118 Wn.2d at 70. Instead, the employee must produce evidence that the actions in furtherance of public policy were \u201ca cause of the firing, and [the employee] may do so by circumstantial evidence.\u201d Id. This test asks whether the employee\u2019s conduct in furthering a public policy was a \u201c \u2018substantial\u2019 \u201d factor motivating the employer to discharge the employee. Id. at 71.\n\u00b628 The \u201cabsence of justification\u201d element examines whether the employer can \u201coffer an overriding justification for the [discharge],\u201d Gardner, 128 Wn.2d at 941 (emphasis omitted), \u201cdespite the employee\u2019s public-policy-linked conduct,\u201d id. at 947. Once a plaintiff presents a prima facie case of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, the burden of proof shifts to the employer to show the termination was justified by an overriding consideration. See id. at 947-50.\n\u00b629 The Court of Appeals did not address this argument, having dismissed Rickman\u2019s claim based on its jeopardy analysis. We therefore remand to the Court of Appeals to consider this alternate ground for the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b630 We reverse the Court of Appeals. Consistent with our analysis in Rose and Becker, the jeopardy element of the tort of wrongful discharge does not require a showing of \u201cstrict adequacy.\u201d Rickman presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact on the prima facie elements of her claim. We remand for the Court of Appeals to address whether the trial court\u2019s order of summary judgment should be affirmed on the alternate ground that Premera met its burden of proof that it had an \u201coverriding justification\u201d for Rickman\u2019s discharge.\nJohnson, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, Gordon McCloud, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nUcentris hires independent contractors, called \u201ccaptive agents,\u2019\u2019 to sell insurance products offered only by Premera and its subsidiaries.\nGrover had recently become Rickman\u2019s supervisor.\nFerrara indicated she believed Rickman was discharged for poor judgment and lack of integrity, not because of a conflict of interest. CP at 115 (Ferrara testified, \u201c[T]he fact that Ms. Rickman did not disclose her son on the conflict of interest was not the reason that she was terminated necessarily. It was really due to judgment and lack of integrity.\u201d). Grover indicated Rickman was discharged for the conflict of interest discovered during the investigation and for her lack of disclosure. CP at 83 (Grover testified, \u201c[T]he immediacy of the termination was the conflict of interest.\u201d).",

        "text": "Fairhurst, J.\n\u00b631 (concurring) \u2014 I agree with the majority that we should reverse the Court of Appeals and remand for that court to address Premera Blue Cross\u2019 alternate arguments. I write separately because, as explained thoroughly in my dissent in Rose v. Anderson Hay & Grain Co., 184 Wn.2d 268, 358 P.3d 1139 (2015), I would not abandon the adequacy of alternative remedies analysis. This analysis is consistent with this court\u2019s precedent and critical to maintaining the narrow scope of the tort of wrongful discharge. See Thompson v. St. Regis Paper Co., 102 Wn.2d 219, 232, 685 P.2d 1081 (1984). Nonetheless, I agree with the majority that Ericka Rickman established the jeopardy element.\n\u00b632 In the dissent to Rose and Becker v. Community Health Services, Inc., 184 Wn.2d 252, 359 P.3d 746 (2015), I express why I believe this court should continue to examine claims for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy under the analytical framework established in Gardner v. Loomis Armored, Inc., 128 Wn.2d 931, 941, 913 P.2d 377 (1996). As I did in Becker, I would analyze Rickman\u2019s claim according to this court\u2019s analytical framework pre- Rose, which includes the adequacy of alternative remedies analysis.\n\u00b633 Prior to Rose, to bring a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy the plaintiff was required to prove (1) the existence of clear public policy (the clarity element), (2) that discouraging the conduct in which he or she engaged would jeopardize the public policy (the jeopardy element), and (3) that the public-policy-linked conduct caused the dismissal (the causation element). Id. at 941. The employer must not be able to offer an overriding justification for the dismissal (the absence of justification element). Id. The only element at issue here is the jeopardy element.\n\u00b634 The jeopardy element ensures that an employer\u2019s management decisions will not be challenged unless a public policy is genuinely threatened. Id. at 941-42. To establish jeopardy, a plaintiff must show that he or she \u201cengaged in particular conduct, and the conduct directly relates to the public policy [ ] or was necessary for the effective enforcement of the public policy.\u201d Id. at 945 (emphasis omitted). The plaintiff must also show that other means of promoting the public policy are inadequate. Id. In addition, a plaintiff must show that the threat of discharge from his or her current position will discourage others from engaging in desirable conduct. Id.\n\u00b635 Here, the clear policy at issue, declared by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d(6), and Uniform Health Care Information Act (UHCIA), chapter 70.02 RCW, is to protect patient privacy. See Clerk\u2019s Papers at 10 (trial court finding that Rickman met the clarity element). Rickman\u2019s conduct was in furtherance of this public policy. See majority at 313. In addition, the threat of Rickman\u2019s discharge could discourage other employees from reporting similar concerns to their supervisors out of fear that they would also be discharged. The only remaining issue in the jeopardy element analysis is whether there is an adequate alternative means to promote the public policy.\n\u00b636 Before Rose, if the statute declaring the public policy also provided an adequate statutory remedy, a plaintiff could not satisfy the jeopardy element and was precluded from bringing a claim for wrongful discharge. See Korslund v. DynCorp Tri-Cities Servs., Inc., 156 Wn.2d 168, 182-83, 125 P.3d 119 (2005); Cudney v. ALSCO, Inc., 172 Wn.2d 524, 531-33, 259 P.3d 244 (2011). This was true even if the statutory remedy was not exclusive. Korslund, 156 Wn.2d at 182-83. If the public policy was already protected under a statutory scheme, then there was no reason to recognize a tort cause of action for the employee.\n\u00b637 A statutory or administrative remedy was adequate if it provided comprehensive remedies. See id. A statutory remedy was comprehensive if it provided damages similar to those available in a tort action and provided a process through which an employee could hold the employer liable. Id. If the remedies appeared comprehensive, this court examined the statutory language to determine if the legislature indicated that the statutory remedy, on its own, was not sufficient to vindicate the public policy. See Piel v. City of Federal Way, 177 Wn.2d 604, 617, 306 P.3d 879 (2013).\n\u00b638 For example, in Korslund we found that an administrative remedy in the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (ERA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851, adequately protected the public policy, such that the plaintiffs were precluded from asserting a claim for wrongful discharge. 156 Wn.2d at 181-83. The ERA provided an administrative process for adjudicating whistle-blower complaints and required a violator to reinstate the employee to his or her former position with the same compensation, terms and conditions of employment, back pay, and compensatory damages. Id.\n\u00b639 While HIPAA provides an administrative scheme for the office of civil rights to receive and investigate complaints, it does not provide adequate remedies for an employee that is wrongfully discharged for reporting violations. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.306(a). HIPAA\u2019s implementing regulations provide that a covered entity or business may not take retaliatory action against an individual or person for reporting violations. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 160.316(a), 160.530(g). However, unlike the ERA examined in Korslund, HIPAA does not provide compensatory damages, reinstatement, or back pay to an employee who was wrongfully discharged. Moreover, HIPAA does not create a private cause of action against an employer. See Watts v. Lyon County Ambulance Serv., No. 5:12-CV-00060-TBR, 2013 WL 557274, at *10, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18393, at *29 (W.D. Ky. Feb. 12, 2013) (court order); Dean v. Liberation Programs, Inc., No. FSTCV136018607S, 2013 WL 6510890, at *8, 2013 Conn. Super. LEXIS 2617, at *22 (Nov. 13, 2013) (unpublished).\n\u00b640 The available state statutory remedy\u2014the UHCIA \u2014is also inadequate. The UHCIA provides a private right of action against a health care provider that does not comply with its terms. RCW 70.02.170(1). However, the statute does not provide a remedy to an employee who is discharged for reporting violations. Because both the UHCIA and HIPAA do not provide comprehensive remedies, they do not provide an adequate alternative means for promoting the public policy.\n\u00b641 Premera asserts that its internal reporting policy is an adequate alternative remedy to preclude Rickman\u2019s tort. This court has never addressed whether an internal company policy is an adequate alternative remedy. I agree with the majority that an internal reporting policy has many differences from a statutorily mandated system for addressing a public policy. Most notably, an internal reporting policy does not provide the employee with a legally enforceable remedy. Because HIPAA, UHCIA, and Premera\u2019s internal policy do not provide an adequate alternative remedy, Rickman established the jeopardy element.\nThe majority\u2019s analysis does not follow the analytical framework established in Rose\n\u00b642 The majority asserts that like in Rose and Becker, it decides the issue here under a \u201ctraditional analysis of Thompson and Gardner.\u201d Majority at 311. While the majority does use the four-part test established in Gardner, it does not follow the burden shifting framework established in Rose. The inconsistency in the analysis between Rose, Becker, and the present case will create increased confusion.\n\u00b643 Under Rose, the first step in the analysis is to determine if Rickman\u2019s action falls into one of the four scenarios easily resolved under Thompson. Rose, 184 Wn.2d at 286-87. If not, the court should use the four-part analysis set forth in Gardner. Id. Because Rickman alleges that she was fired for reporting employer misconduct, or whistle-blowing activities, her conduct fits into a Thompson category. Therefore, under Rose, the next step is to determine whether Rickman established her burden of showing that she was terminated for whistle-blowing activities. See id. at 287. If Rickman met this burden, then the burden should shift to Premera to demonstrate that Rickman\u2019s discharge was for other reasons. Instead of following this framework, the majority skipped the first step and decided the case under the four-part framework established in Gardner. According to this court in Rose and Becker, the majority should not have undergone such a refined analysis. See id. at 287; Becker, 184 Wn.2d at 258-59.\n\u00b644 I note the inconsistency in the analysis between Rose, Becker, and this case because it demonstrates the confusion regarding the analytical framework established in Rose. I believe this court would achieve a more consistent analysis and result by following our precedent pre-Rose. Nevertheless, I concur with the majority\u2019s holding to reverse the Court of Appeals insofar as it held that Rickman could not establish the jeopardy element.\nMadsen, C.J., and Owens, J., concur with Fairhurst, J.\nAfter modification, further reconsideration denied November 24, 2015.\nThe Court of Appeals did not address the remedies provided by HIPAA or the UHCIA to determine if they were adequate. Rickman v. Premera Blue Cross, noted at 183 Wn. App. 1015, 2014 WL 4347625, at *7, 2014 Wash. App. LEXIS 2171, at *10. The Court of Appeals found that the internal reporting system provided by Premera was adequate to protect the alleged public policy. 2014 WL 4347625, at *6, 2014 Wash. App. LEXIS 2171, at *8.\nIn Piel, this court found that statutory language stating that the statutory remedy was intended to be in addition to other remedies indicated that the statutory remedy was insufficient to vindicate public policy. 177 Wn.2d at 617. The Piel court, therefore, held that the plaintiff could establish the jeopardy element. Id.\nBecause questions of fact remain about Premera\u2019s justification for discharging Rickman, the outcome\u2014reversing and remanding the case to the Court of Appeals\u2014likely would have been the same.",

        "text": "Owens, J.\n\u00b61 J.C. Johnson was convicted of five crimes related to several days of ongoing domestic violence against his wife. We review two holdings by the Court of Appeals. First, the Court of Appeals overturned Johnson\u2019s unlawful imprisonment conviction because the State did not include the definition of \u201crestrain\u201d in the information charging him with the crime. We reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate Johnson\u2019s conviction because charging documents need contain only the essential elements of a crime, not related definitions. Second, the Court of Appeals agreed with Johnson that it was error to give a jury instruction on the generic definition of \u201creckless\u201d for the charge of assault in the second degree but held that his counsel was not ineffective for proposing it because no court had yet ruled on the issue. On this issue we affirm the Court of Appeals, but for a different reason. It is not error to instruct the jury on the generic definition of \u201creckless\u201d as long as the jury is also given a \u201cto convict\u201d instruction that lists every element of the crime the State needs to prove in order to convict the defendant, including the charge-specific language for \u201creckless.\u201d\nFACTS\n\u00b62 A jury convicted Johnson for acts of domestic violence against his wife, J.J. For three days Johnson kept J.J. in their apartment under his control. Johnson would not let her get dressed while inside, and she only went out of the apartment accompanied by him. At times, Johnson used his 130-pound rottweiler to restrain her movements. J.J. testified that he kept a knife and an ice pick near the bed to intimidate her. J.J. also testified that she did not feel free to leave, in part, because he threatened to hurt her children from a previous marriage.\n\u00b63 During those three days, Johnson severely injured J.J. He choked her on multiple occasions. J.J. testified that he also hit her with rocks and allowed his rottweiler to bite her. J.J. also testified that he grabbed her and slammed her down so that she hit her neck. Johnson admitted at trial that he \u201cshoved her hard\u201d and she fell and hit her head. Report of Proceedings (Dec. 14, 2010) at 33-34.\n\u00b64 J.J. finally escaped after Johnson threatened to kill her by suffocating her with duct tape. J.J. ran from the house in her underwear when he turned his back on her, and found help from a neighbor. J.J. received treatment for her injuries, which included dog bites, bruises, and severe swelling \u2014 especially around her face and throat.\n\u00b65 The State charged Johnson with five crimes, including unlawful imprisonment and second degree assault for intentionally assaulting another and thereby recklessly inflicting substantial bodily harm. The jury convicted Johnson on all counts, and Johnson appealed. The Court of Appeals held that the information for the unlawful imprisonment charge was insufficient because it left out the definition of \u201crestrain.\u201d State v. Johnson, 172 Wn. App. 112, 136-40, 297 P.3d 710 (2012). The court also held that the jury instruction defining \u201creckless\u201d for the assault charge improperly lowered the State\u2019s burden of proof but that defense counsel was not deficient for proposing it. Id. at 133. We granted review of those two issues only. State v. Johnson, 178 Wn.2d 1001, 308 P.3d 642 (2013).\nISSUES\n\u00b66 1. Was the information for the unlawful imprisonment charge sufficient even though it did not include the definition of \u201crestrain?\u201d\n\u00b67 2. Did defense counsel provide ineffective assistance by proposing a definition of \u201creckless\u201d in the jury instructions that did not include charge-specific language when the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction included the specific language?\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\u00b68 Johnson challenges the sufficiency of the information on constitutional grounds. \u201cWe review allegations of constitutional violations de novo.\u201d State v. Siers, 174 Wn.2d 269, 273-74, 274 P.3d 358 (2012). He also challenges the jury instructions in his case. \u201cWe review jury instructions de novo.\u201d State v. Levy, 156 Wn.2d 709, 721, 132 P.3d 1076 (2006).\nANALYSIS\n1. The Information Was Constitutionally Sufficient\n\u00b69 In criminal cases, the accused has the constitutional right to know the charges against them. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Wash. Const. art. I, \u00a7 22. The State formally gives notice of the charges in the information, also known as the charging document. See CrR 2.1(a)(1) (\u201c[T]he information shall be a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.\u201d).\n\u00b610 The information is constitutionally sufficient \u201conly if all essential elements of a crime, statutory and nonstatutory, are included in the document.\u201d State v. Vangerpen, 125 Wn.2d 782, 787, 888 P.2d 1177 (1995). \u201c \u2018An essential element is one whose specification is necessary to establish the very illegality of the behavior charged.\u2019 \u201d State v. Zillyette, 178 Wn.2d 153, 158, 307 P.3d 712 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Ward, 148 Wn.2d 803, 811, 64 P.3d 640 (2003)). This essential elements rule exists \u201cto apprise the accused of the charges against him or her and to allow the defendant to prepare a defense.\u201d Vangerpen, 125 Wn.2d at 787. If the State fails to allege every essential element, then the information is insufficient and the charge must be dismissed without prejudice. State v. Nonog, 169 Wn.2d 220, 226 n.3, 237 P.3d 250 (2010).\n\u00b611 Johnson was charged with unlawful imprisonment under former RCW 9A.40.040 (1975). That statute reads, \u201cA person is guilty of unlawful imprisonment if he knowingly restrains another person.\u201d The information at issue in this case reads as follows:\nAnd I, Daniel T. Satterberg, Prosecuting Attorney aforesaid further do accuse J.C. JOHNSON of the crime of Unlawful Imprisonment - Domestic Violence, based on a series of acts connected together with another crime charged herein, committed as follows:\nThat the defendant J.C. JOHNSON in King County, Washington, during a period of time intervening between May 4, 2009 through May 6, 2009, did knowingly restrain [J.J.], a human being;\nContrary to RCW 9A.40.040, and against the peace and dignity of the State of Washington.\nClerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 18. Johnson argues that the information is deficient because it does not include the statutory definition of \u201crestrain.\u201d \u201cRestrain\u201d is defined as \u201cto restrict a person\u2019s movements without consent and without legal authority in a manner which interferes substantially with his liberty.\u201d Former RCW 9A.40.010(1) (1975).\n\u00b612 Johnson relies on State v. Warfield, 103 Wn. App. 152, 157, 5 P.3d 1280 (2000), where the Court of Appeals held that the term \u201cknowingly\u201d in the unlawful imprisonment statute modifies every aspect of the term \u201crestrain.\u201d Thus, the court held that the State must prove that the defendant knew that the restraint was (1) without consent and (2) without legal authority, in a manner that interfered substantially with the victim\u2019s liberty. Id. Johnson argues that this definition is an essential element of the crime that must appear in the information because the State must prove that he knew that he lacked legal authority to restrain the victim. We disagree.\nA. The Information Does Not Need To Include Definitions\n\u00b613 The State need not include definitions of elements in the information. It was enough that the State alleged all of the essential elements found in the unlawful imprisonment statute, former RCW 9A.40.040. We have never held that the information must also include definitions of essential elements. In fact, we have rejected similar arguments before.\n\u00b614 In State v. Allen, 176 Wn.2d 611, 626-27, 294 P.3d 679 (2013), the defendant was charged with felony harassment under RCW 9A.46.020, which makes it a crime to \u201cknowingly threaten! ] . . . [t]o cause bodily injury.\u201d RCW 9A.46.020(1)(a)(i). The State did not include in the information the constitutional limitation that only true threats may be charged, and the defendant argued that this omission was error. Allen, 176 Wn.2d at 626-27. We disagreed. Importantly, we noted, \u201cWe have never held the true threat requirement to be an essential element of a harassment statute.\u201d Id. at 628. Rather, \u201c \u2018the constitutional concept of \u201ctrue threat\u201d merely defines and limits the scope of the essential threat element in the felony telephone harassment statute and is not itself an essential element of the crime.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 630 (quoting State v. Tellez, 141 Wn. App. 479, 484, 170 P.3d 75 (2007)). Thus, we found no error in the information that did not include the \u201ctrue threat\u201d concept. Id.\n\u00b615 The reasoning in Allen applies to this case. Like the \u201ctrue threat\u201d concept, the definition of \u201crestrain\u201d defines and limits the scope of the essential elements. That does not make the definition itself an essential element that must be included in the information. In this case, the information included all of the essential elements, and therefore we hold that it was constitutionally sufficient.\n\u00b616 Johnson argues that the definition of \u201crestrain\u201d expands rather than limits the scope of the mens rea element because the State must prove that the defendant knew that the restraint was without legal authority. That argument relies entirely on the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding in Warfield. We take this opportunity to examine that case further.\nB. Warfield Involved a Unique Set of Facts and Does Not Apply Here\n\u00b617 Johnson is misguided in relying on Warfield for the proposition that the definition of \u201crestrain\u201d is an essential element because the State must prove that he knew he did not have legal authority to restrain his wife. Warfield involved a group of bounty hunters who had a good faith belief that they had the legal authority to catch, restrain, and return a person to Arizona, where there was a warrant for the person\u2019s arrest. 103 Wn. App. at 154-55. The State charged them with unlawful imprisonment because the Arizona warrant \u2014 which turned out to be for a misdemeanor \u2014 had no lawful effect in Washington, and the trial court denied their motion to dismiss based on the defense that they thought they had legal authority to restrain the victim. Id. at 155. The Court of Appeals reversed and, as noted above, held that the State must prove that the defendants knew they lacked legal authority to restrain the victim. Id. at 157. Because it was undisputed that the defendants believed they had legal authority to restrain the victim, the Court of Appeals dismissed the charges. Id. at 159. The court never discussed what must be included in the information.\n\u00b618 Because the Warfield defendants had a good faith belief that they had legal authority to restrain the victim, Warfield is a unique case. The Warfield court\u2019s logic does not extend to most unlawful imprisonment cases \u2014 particularly those involving domestic violence \u2014 where there is no indication that the defendants believed they actually had legal authority to imprison the victim. Today we clarify that Warfield\u2019s holding is limited to those unique cases where the defendant had a good faith belief that he or she had legal authority to imprison a person.\n2. Counsel Was Not Ineffective for Proposing the Jury Instruction Defining \u201cReckless\u201d That Was Used at Trial\n\u00b619 Johnson challenges his conviction of assault in the second degree, arguing that his counsel was ineffective for proposing the definition of \u201creckless\u201d that was used in the jury instructions at trial. Under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a criminal defendant has the constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 685-86, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). To show ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that counsel\u2019s errors prejudiced the defendant\u2019s ability to receive a fair trial. Id. at 687; State v. McFarland, 127 Wn.2d 322, 334-35, 899 P.2d 1251 (1995).\n\u00b620 The State charged Johnson with assault under former RCW 9A.36.021(1)(a) (2007), which provides that a person is guilty of second degree assault if he or she \u201c[intentionally assaults another and thereby recklessly inflicts substantial bodily harm.\u201d Using that language, the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction in this case read:\nTo convict the defendant of the crime of assault in the second degree, as charged in count II, each of the following elements of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n(1) That during the time intervening between May 4, 2009 and May 6, 2009, the defendant intentionally assaulted [J.J.];\n(2) That the defendant thereby recklessly inflicted substantial bodily harm on [J.J.]; and\n(3) That the acts occurred in the State of Washington.\nCP at 49 (emphasis added). Johnson does not challenge this instruction. Rather, he faults his counsel for proposing the general definition of \u201creckless\u201d also given to the jury. That instruction \u2014 based on the Washington Practice: Washington Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal (WPIC) \u2014 read:\nA person is reckless or acts recklessly when he or she knows of and disregards a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and this disregard is a gross deviation from conduct that a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation.\nWhen recklessness as to a particular fact or result is required to establish an element of a crime, the element is also established if a person acts intentionally or knowingly as to that fact or result.\nCP at 42 (emphasis added). He argues that the general instruction regarding recklessness lowered the State\u2019s burden of proof because the phrase \u201ca wrongful act\u201d was used instead of the more charge-specific language \u201csubstantial bodily harm.\u201d The Court of Appeals agreed that under current Court of Appeals precedent, the charge-specific language must be used in the definition of \u201creckless,\u201d but the court found that counsel provided effective assistance because the trial occurred prior to the 2011 Court of Appeals cases that held that charge-specific language must be used in the definition of \u201creckless.\u201d Johnson, 172 Wn. App. at 133 (citing State v. Peters, 163 Wn. App. 836, 261 P.3d 199 (2011); State v. Harris, 164 Wn. App. 377, 263 P.3d 1276 (2011)).\n\u00b621 We affirm the Court of Appeals, but for a different reason. Johnson received effective assistance but not because the Court of Appeals had yet to rule on the issue. Rather, the generic instruction defining \u201creckless\u201d was sufficient without the charge-specific language given that the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction included the proper language.\n\u00b622 We consider challenges to jury instructions in the context of the jury instructions as a whole. State v. Pirtle, 127 Wn.2d 628, 656, 904 P.2d 245 (1995). \u201cJury instructions, taken in their entirety, must inform the jury that the State bears the burden of proving every essential element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Specifically, the \u201c \u2018to convict [jury] instruction must contain all of the elements of the crime because it serves as a yardstick by which the jury measures the evidence to determine guilt or innocence.\u2019 \u201d State v. Sibert, 168 Wn.2d 306, 311, 230 P.3d 142 (2010) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Smith, 131 Wn.2d 258, 263, 930 P.2d 917 (1997)). We will not look to other jury instructions to supplement a defective \u201cto convict\u201d instruction. Id.\n\u00b623 Taken in their entirety, the instructions in this case were sufficient. The \u201cto convict\u201d instruction properly laid out the elements of the crime. It identified the wrongful act contemplated by Johnson as \u201csubstantial bodily harm.\u201d Separately providing a generic definition of \u201creckless\u201d did not relieve the State of its burden of proof. The \u201cto convict\u201d instructions are the primary \u201cyardstick\u201d the jury uses to measure culpability, and here they were accurate. The Court of Appeals incorrectly concluded that the definitional instruction also had to use the charge-specific language.\n\u00b624 Under the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, any crime where recklessness is an element would require charge-specific language in both the \u201cto convict\u201d instructions and the general instruction on the definition of \u201creckless.\u201d See Harris, 164 Wn. App. at 385 (requiring the substitution of \u201cwrongful act\u201d in the WPIC general definition of \u201creckless\u201d with the statutory language for assault in the first degree, even when the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction properly described the specific wrongful act). If we adopted this reasoning, jury instructions could never include a general definition of \u201creckless.\u201d\n\u00b625 That implication is problematic. A jury could face great confusion in cases where a defendant is charged with multiple crimes that require multiple \u201creckless\u201d definitions. The State offers the example of a defendant charged with drive-by shooting, assault in the second degree, and reckless endangerment \u2014 all of which aim to prevent a unique harm. See RCW 9A.36.045, .021, .050. Under the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, separate definitions of \u201creckless\u201d would be needed for each crime, causing confusion and adding unnecessary repetition to the jury instructions.\n\u00b626 Additionally, when the reasoning of the Court of Appeals is applied to other crimes, the \u201creckless\u201d definitions become unduly confusing. For example, if a court added the charge-specific language needed for criminal mistreatment in the second degree, the instruction regarding the definition of \u201crecklessness\u201d would read:\nA person is reckless or acts recklessly when he or she knows of and disregards a substantial risk that an imminent and substantial risk of death or great bodily harm may occur and this disregard is a gross deviation from conduct that a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation.\nSee RCW 9A.42.030(1); RCW 9A.08.010(1)(c). The added language makes the definition confusing given the multiple layers of substantial risks contemplated. In some cases, parties may consider adding charge-specific language to the \u201creckless\u201d definition, as the WPIC recommends. 11 WPIC 10.03 cmt. at 209 (3d ed. 2008). But it is not error to use the generic definition of \u201creckless\u201d when the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction contains all of the essential elements, including the charge-specific language for recklessness. Having found that no error occurred, we hold that counsel provided effective assistance.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b627 We hold that the charging information for Johnson\u2019s unlawful imprisonment charge was constitutionally sufficient because it needed to contain only the essential elements of the crime, not related definitions. We reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue and reinstate Johnson\u2019s conviction for unlawful imprisonment. We also hold that Johnson\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for proposing a jury instruction on the generic definition of \u201creckless\u201d for the second degree assault charge because we review instructions as a whole, and here the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction accurately expressed the essential elements of the crime. We affirm the Court of Appeals on this issue, albeit for different reasoning.\nMadsen, C.J.; C. Johnson, Fairhurst, Stephens, and Gonz\u00e1lez, JJ.; and J.M. Johnson, J. Pro Tem., concur.\nJ.C. uses his initials as his legal name and is referred to hereinafter as \u201cJohnson.\u201d\nWe use J. J.\u2019s initials to protect her privacy.\nWe note that our decision resolves a split in the Court of Appeals. After we issued our decision in Allen, a different panel of the same division properly held that the information does not need to include the definition of \u201crestrain.\u201d State v.

        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b628 (concurring in part and dissenting in part) \u2014 The majority holds that because the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction contained all the elements of the charged crime of second degree assault, it does not matter that one of those elements was defined too broadly in another instruction. I respectfully dissent.\n\u00b629 The \u201cto convict\u201d instruction in this case correctly told the jury that in order to convict the defendant of second degree assault, the State must prove (among other things) that the defendant \u201crecklessly inflict[ed] substantial bodily harm\u201d on another. RCW 9A.36.021(1)(a). Another instruction in this case then defined the mental state of \u201crecklessly\u201d: \u201cA person is reckless or acts recklessly when he or she knows of and disregards a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur ....\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 42. The defendant argues that the lack of charge-specific language in this definitional jury instruction permitted the jury to convict him if he was reckless as to any wrongful act occurring, whereas our case law requires that he may be convicted only if he was reckless as to the specific wrongful act charged \u2014 i.e., inflicting substantial bodily harm.\n\u00b630 The majority implicitly acknowledges that the jury must find the defendant was reckless as to the specific wrongful act that is an element of the criminal charge. It asserts, though, that because the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction for second degree assault properly required the jury to find that the defendant \u201crecklessly inflicted substantial bodily harm\u201d on the victim, CP at 49, using the general definition of \u201creckless\u201d elsewhere in the instructions, CP at 42, was not error.\n\u00b631 I disagree with the majority\u2019s reasoning. The fact that the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction properly stated the elements of second degree assault does not cure the overbroad definition of \u201creckless.\u201d This becomes evident when one plugs the general definition of \u201creckless\u201d into the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction: \u201cTo convict the defendant. . ., each of the following elements ... must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt: . . . That the defendant thereby [knowing of and disregarding a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur] inflicted substantial bodily harm.\u201d CP at 49. Thus, including the phrase \u201crecklessly inflicted substantial bodily harm\u201d in the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction does nothing to prevent the jury from convicting if it finds, for example, that the defendant was reckless as to inflicting minor bodily harm, but in fact inflicted substantial bodily harm. That relieves the State of its burden to prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt. And it is precisely the inclusion of the general definition of \u201creckless\u201d elsewhere in the instructions that permits such a conviction based on a lesser burden of proof for the State.\n\u00b632 The majority\u2019s other reasons for allowing a general definition of \u201creckless\u201d in a case where the State must prove recklessness as to a specific act are likewise unconvincing. First, the majority asserts that if it decided this case differently, a general definition of \u201creckless\u201d could never be used in jury instructions. But the general definition instruction quoted above should never be used in jury instructions, because it does in fact lower the State\u2019s burden of proof. A modified instruction, referring to something other than disregarding the risk of \u201ca wrongful act,\u201d might cure the problem, though. For example, the definition could reference \u201cthe wrongful result charged\u201d in the \u201cto convict\u201d instruction. See State v. Cronin, 142 Wn.2d 568, 579, 14 P.3d 752 (2000) (accomplice liability instruction must reference intent to further \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe crime\u201d \u2019 \u201d charged, not just \u201c \u2018 \u201ca crime\u201d \u2019 \u201d (quoting State v. Roberts, 142 Wn.2d 471, 513, 14 P.3d 713 (2000))). But use of the general definition instruction given here does not help; instead, it creates the problem.\n\u00b633 Second, the majority is concerned that when the State charges multiple crimes with a mens rea of \u201crecklessness,\u201d multiple charge-specific definitions of \u201creckless\u201d would be confusing and repetitive. On the contrary, multiple charge-specific definitions would provide specificity. Or, a single instruction referencing \u201cthe wrongful act charged\u201d might do the trick. Either solution would reduce the potential for jury confusion as to which act the recklessness mens rea applied. Otherwise, in the multiple-recklessness-crimes scenario, a jury might find, for example, that recklessness as to one of the charged acts sufficed to establish recklessness for all the charged acts, and such a finding would in fact be supported by a literal reading of the definition in the jury instructions.\n\u00b634 Third, the majority worries that some charge-specific definitions might be confusing. That may be so, but if such a definition is too confusing, it should be dealt with on a case by case basis and not by relieving the State of its burden to show recklessness as to the particular charge at issue.\n\u00b635 The majority\u2019s resolution of this case permits a jury to convict where it finds recklessness as to any act, not just the specific criminal act charged, and thus relieves the State of its full burden to prove each element of the charged crime. While I agree with the majority\u2019s decision on the unlawful imprisonment charge, I respectfully dissent from its decision as to the assault charge.\nWiggins, J., concurs with Gordon McCloud, J.\nIndeed, the majority must acknowledge this because it is the law. See, e.g., State v. Gamble, 154 Wn.2d 457, 467, 114 P.3d 646 (2005) (\u201cLooking to the \u2018wrongful act\u2019 caused by a defendant\u2019s actions, to prove manslaughter the State must show Gamble \u2018[knew] of and disregarded] a substantial risk that a [homicide] may occur.\u2019 \u201d (alterations in original) (quoting ROW 9A.08.010(1)(c))).",

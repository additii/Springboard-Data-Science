        "text": "[As amended by order of the Supreme Court April 27, 2016.]\nYu, J.\n\u00b61 We are asked to decide whether retroactive application of the legislature\u2019s amendment to a business and occupation (B&O) tax exemption violates a taxpayer\u2019s rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1, collateral estop-pel, or separation of powers principles. Taxpayer Dot Foods Inc. contends that it should remain eligible for a B&O tax exemption pursuant to our decision in Dot Foods, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, 166 Wn.2d 912, 215 P.3d 185 (2009) (Dot Foods I), despite an intervening, contrary amendment to the applicable law. Because Dot Foods I does not encompass the tax periods before us now, we hold that retroactive application of the legislative amendment to Dot Foods does not violate due process, collateral estoppel, or separation of powers principles. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\nFactual and Procedural History\n\u00b62 The B&O tax is imposed for \u201cthe act or privilege of engaging in business activities\u201d within the state. RCW 82.04.220(1). The tax applies unless a specific exemption exists. See RCW 82.04.310-.427; see also TracFone Wireless, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 170 Wn.2d 273, 296-97, 242 P.3d 810 (2010). Former RCW 82.04.423(1)(d) (1983) exempted certain out-of-state sellers from the B&O tax if they made \u201csales in this state exclusively to or through a direct seller\u2019s representative,\u201d as defined in former RCW 82.04.423(2).\n\u00b63 Dot Foods is an Illinois-based food reseller that sells products to service companies in Washington through its wholly owned subsidiary DTI. Dot Foods qualified for the direct seller\u2019s exemption under former RCW 82.04.423 from 1997 until 2000, when the Department of Revenue (Department) narrowed its interpretation of the statute. This new interpretation gave rise to Dot Foods I, the previous tax appeal implicated in the current dispute.\n\u00b64 In 2009, we decided Dot Foods I, which held that the Department\u2019s revised interpretation of RCW 82.04.423 was contrary to the statute\u2019s plain and unambiguous language. Dot Foods I, 166 Wn.2d at 920-21. We concluded that \u201cDot [Foods] remains qualified for the B&O tax exemption to the extent its sales continue to qualify for the exemption.\u201d Id. at 926.\n\u00b65 Dot Foods continued to pay the full B&O tax during the pendency of its prior tax appeal to avoid penalties and interest. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 360. In December 2009, pursuant to the judgment in Dot Foods I, Dot Foods requested a refund for B&O taxes paid from January 2005 through August 2009, id. at 83-84, a time period that extends beyond the tax periods directly at issue in Dot Foods I.\n\u00b66 In April 2010, the legislature amended former RCW 82.04.423 in direct response to our decision in Dot Foods I. Laws of 2010, 1st Spec. Sess., ch. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 401, 402. The amendment retroactively narrowed the scope of RCW 82.04-.423(2) and prospectively repealed the direct seller\u2019s exemption. Id. \u00a7 401(4). It is undisputed that Dot Foods qualified for the exemption under former RCW 82.04.423 but is ineligible for the exemption under the 2010 amendment.\n\u00b67 In July 2010, based on the retroactive application of the 2010 amendment, the Department denied Dot Foods\u2019 refund request for the periods outside the litigation in Dot Foods I, \u201c[specifically, the refund request for Wholesaling B&O tax for the periods from May 2006 through August 2009.\u201d CP at 309. However, the Department explained that \u201cretroactive application of the bill does not affect the periods included in the Dot Foods Supreme Court decision. Specifically, it will not apply to the periods from January 2000 through April 2006.\u201d Id. at 308. Later that year, Dot Foods negotiated a settlement with the Department for over 97 percent of the B&O taxes paid from January 2000 through April 2006, the refund period directly at issue in Dot Foods I. Dot Foods\u2019 Resp. Br. & Br. on Cross-Appeal (Dot Foods\u2019 Resp. Br.) at 7.\n\u00b68 Dot Foods now seeks a refund for the B&O taxes it paid from May 2006 through December 2007, the interim period beginning immediately after the tax periods at issue in Dot Foods I and ending when Dot Foods\u2019 business practices changed in 2008. After the Department denied its refund request, Dot Foods brought a refund action against the Department in Thurston County Superior Court, challenging retroactive application of the amendment under theories of collateral estoppel, separation of powers, and due process.\n\u00b69 In a letter opinion, the trial court granted summary judgment to the Department on the collateral estoppel and separation of powers issues but found in favor of Dot Foods on the due process claim. CP at 468-74. The Department appealed, and Dot Foods cross appealed on the separation of powers and collateral estoppel issues. The Court of Appeals certified the case to this court pursuant to RAP 4.4.\nAnalysis\n\u00b610 The history of litigation around Washington\u2019s B&O tax and its subsequent amendments has been a long and winding road. While the constitutional validity of the ability to impose a B&O tax is not at issue, this case requires us to examine whether due process and collateral estoppel should disallow retroactive application of an amended statute to a particular period of time. The dispute before us is resolved by our own precedent, traditional legal principles, and cases from the United States Supreme Court and federal district courts.\nA. Due Process Claim\n\u00b611 The Supreme Court set forth the due process standard for retroactive tax legislation in United States v. Carlton, 512 U.S. 26, 114 S. Ct. 2018, 129 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1994). Carlton established that \u201c[t]he due process standard to be applied to tax statutes with retroactive effect... is the same as that generally applicable to retroactive economic legislation,\u201d id. at 30; that is, the statute must be \u201c \u2018supported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by rational means.\u2019\u201d Id. at 30-31 (quoting Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. R.A. Gray & Co., 467 U.S. 717, 729, 104 S. Ct. 2709, 81 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1984)). Retroactive legislation must meet an additional burden not faced by statutes with only prospective effect, but \u201c \u2018that burden is met simply by showing that the retroactive application of the legislation is itself justified by a rational legislative purpose.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 31 (quoting Pension Benefit, 467 U.S. at 730).\n\u00b612 We affirmed a retroactive tax amendment under the Carlton rational basis standard most recently in In re Estate of Hambleton, 181 Wn.2d 802, 335 P.3d 398 (2014), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 318 (2015). The legislature retroactively amended the Estate and Transfer Tax Act, chapter 83.100 RCW, in direct response to our decision in In re Estate of Bracken, 175 Wn.2d 549, 290 P.3d 99 (2012). In Hambleton, we upheld the retroactive application of the amendment against a due process challenge under the Carlton rational basis standard.\n\u00b613 Although the present case involves a different tax scheme, the underlying facts are analogous to those in Hambleton, which is controlling precedent here. Under the rational basis standard set forth in Carlton, as applied in Hambleton, retroactive application of the 2010 amendment at issue here does not violate due process protections.\ni. The 2010 amendment serves a legitimate legislative purpose\n\u00b614 As with other economic legislation, a tax statute must serve a legitimate legislative purpose. Carlton, 512 U.S. at 30. The legislature identified the prevention of \u201clarge and devastating revenue losses\u201d as the primary purpose for narrowing the scope of RCW 82.04.423. Laws of 2010, 1st Spec. Sess., ch. 23, \u00a7 401(3). This is the same legislative intent that the Supreme Court recognized as a legitimate purpose in Carlton, 512 U.S. at 32, and that we upheld in Hambleton, 181 Wn.2d at 827. Additionally, the legislature concluded that former RCW 82.04.423 provided \u201cpreferential tax treatment for out-of-state businesses over their in-state competitors and now creates a strong incentive for in-state businesses to move their operations outside Washington.\u201d Laws of 2010, 1st Spec. Sess., ch. 23, \u00a7 401(3). This is analogous to the legislature\u2019s goal of restoring parity between different classes of taxpayers, which we also accepted as a legitimate legislative purpose in Hambleton, 181 Wn.2d at 826. See also Am. Nat'l Can Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 114 Wn.2d 236, 247-48, 787 P.2d 545 (1990). It is clear that the amendment to RCW 82.04.423 serves a legitimate legislative purpose under our case law.\n\u00b615 Dot Foods alleges that the 2010 amendment is not supported by a legitimate legislative purpose because the legislature was attempting to reinstate the \u201c \u2018original intent\u2019 \u201d of the direct seller\u2019s exemption. Dot Foods\u2019 Resp. Br. at 19. Dot Foods contends, and the trial court agreed, that because \u201cthe [l]egislature cannot know the intentions of a prior, distant legislature,\u201d the asserted purpose of the amendment is both arbitrary and unreasonable. Id.; see also CP at 473.\n\u00b616 However, our duty is to review the statute for its rational basis, not to analyze the strength of its epistemological underpinnings. The rational basis test is the \u201cmost relaxed form of judicial scrutiny.\u201d Amunrud v. Bd. of Appeals, 158 Wn.2d 208, 223, 143 P.3d 571 (2006). Our review is highly deferential, especially in light of the fact that the legislature \u201c \u2018possesses a plenary power in matters of taxation except as limited by the [Constitution,\u2019 \u201d State ex rel. Heavey v. Murphy, 138 Wn.2d 800, 809, 982 P.2d 611 (1999) (quoting Belas v. Kiga, 135 Wn.2d 913, 919, 959 P.2d 1037 (1998)), and \u201c \u2018a particularly heavy presumption of constitutionality applies when the statute concerns economic matters,\u2019 \u201d Ford Motor Co. v. Barrett, 115 Wn.2d 556, 563, 800 P.2d 367 (1990) (quoting Am. Network, Inc. v. Utils. & Transp. Comm\u2019n, 113 Wn.2d 59, 79, 776 P.2d 950 (1989)). We have previously observed that where the legislature holds plenary power, \u201cthe courts will not question the wisdom or desirability of such legislative requirements, so long as there is any reasonable basis upon which the legislative determination can rest.\u201d Ellestad v. Swayze, 15 Wn.2d 281, 291, 130 P.2d 349 (1942) (emphasis added), quoted in Nguyen v. Med. Quality Assur. Comm\u2019n, 144 Wn.2d 516, 549, 29 P.3d 689 (2001).\n\u00b617 Dot Foods further claims that Carlton requires revenue losses be \u201c \u2018unanticipated\u2019 \u201d to meet the rational basis standard. Dot Foods\u2019 Resp. Br. at 28 (quoting Hambleton, 181 Wn.2d at 825 (citing Carlton, 512 U.S. at 32)). There is no holding in Carlton to that effect, and Dot Foods provides no case law supporting this contention. The fact that the revenue losses in Carlton were, in fact, \u201cunanticipated\u201d is dictum. Carlton, 512 U.S. at 32. Carlton should not be\u2014and has not been\u2014interpreted as requiring that revenue losses be \u201cunanticipated\u201d in order to satisfy the rational basis standard.\n\u00b618 Similarly, the allegation that the amendment fails to serve a legitimate purpose because the legislature had an \u201cimproper motive\u201d of targeting Dot Foods is unsubstantiated. The fact that the legislature was acting in direct response to our decision in Dot Foods I does not constitute targeting a specific taxpayer, and the statement of intent does not single out Dot Foods beyond pointing to the negative impact that the decision would have on revenue generally. The \u201cimproper motive\u201d that the Court refers to in Carlton was targeting taxpayers after deliberately inducing them to engage in certain transactions. Carlton, 512 U.S. at 32. We see no evidence of any improper motive here\u2014only the normal interplay between the legislature and the judiciary. Furthermore, as long as it is acting within its lawful power, \u201cthe motives of the [l]egislature are irrelevant to questions of state taxation under the due process clause.\u201d Am. Nat\u2019l Can Corp., 114 Wn.2d at 247 (citing A. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U.S. 40, 44, 54 S. Ct. 599, 78 L. Ed. 1109 (1934)).\n\u00b619 We do not find support for Dot Foods\u2019 assertions and hold that the 2010 amendment serves a legitimate legislative purpose.\nii. The 2010 amendment is rationally related to the legitimate legislative purpose\n\u00b620 A retroactivity period meets the Carlton standard if it is rationally related to the amendment\u2019s legitimate purpose. Hambleton, 181 Wn.2d at 823. Relying on Tesoro Refining & Marketing Co. v. Department of Revenue, 159 Wn. App. 104, 246 P.3d 211 (2010) (Tesoro I), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 173 Wn.2d 551, 269 P.3d 1013 (2012), Dot Foods asserts that the purported 27-year retroactivity period is \u201cirrational on its face.\u201d Dot Foods\u2019 Resp. Br. at 24.\n\u00b621 Tesoro I is not controlling authority on this court, and to the extent that the trial court relied on this case, it was operating in the absence of our decision in Ham-bleton. Further, Dot Foods\u2019 contention that a 27-year retroac-tivity period is per se unconstitutional is belied by the fact that we upheld a retroactive amendment that occurred 37 years after the statute was originally enacted in W.R. Grace & Co. v. Department of Revenue, 137 Wn.2d 580, 973 P.2d 1011 (1999). Thus, the length of time that has elapsed since a statute\u2019s original enactment is not dispositive.\n\u00b622 While it is true that the 2010 amendment theoretically dates back to enactment under the plain language of section 402 and section 1704, Laws of 2010,1st Spec. Sess., ch. 23, the actual retroactive application of the amendment is necessarily limited by the particularities of this case as well as the applicable statute of limitations. At issue here is whether the amendment, which went into effect on May 1, 2010, applies retroactively to the May 2006 through December 2007 interim tax periods. Thus, the retroactivity period as applied to Dot Foods is only four years.\n\u00b623 In practical terms, the 2010 amendment cannot reach back 27 years, as Dot Foods alleges. The statute of limitations prescribed by RCW 82.32.060(1) functionally limits retroactive application of the amendment to four years. A four-year retroactivity period, both as applied to Dot Foods in this particular case or as generally applicable to any other taxpayer under the statute of limitations, is well within the range of retroactivity periods that we have previously upheld. See Hambleton, 181 Wn.2d at 827 (eight-year retroactivity period); Digital Equip. Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 129 Wn.2d 177, 194-95, 916 P.2d 933 (1996) (four-year retroactivity period); W.R. Grace, 137 Wn.2d at 586-87 (eight-year retroactivity period).\n\u00b624 Furthermore, there is no \u201cabsolute temporal limitation on retroactivity.\u201d W.R. Grace, 137 Wn.2d at 602. The standard set forth in Carlton, which has been followed by this court, states only that the retroactive period must be \u201crationally related\u201d to a legitimate legislative purpose. Hambleton, 181 Wn.2d at 823 (citing Carlton, 512 U.S. at 30-31). While there are certainly constitutional limits on how far back laws may reach, see State v. Pac. Tel. & Tel. Co., 9 Wn.2d 11, 113 P.2d 542 (1941), whether the length of a retroactivity period breaches that limit should be determined by a qualitative analysis of the law, not solely by a quantitative measurement of time, see Welch v. Henry, 305 U.S. 134, 147, 59 S. Ct. 121, 83 L. Ed. 87 (1938) (\u201cIn each case it is necessary to consider the nature of the tax and the circumstances in which it is laid before it can be said that its retroactive application is so harsh and oppressive as to transgress the constitutional limitation.\u201d).\n\u00b625 In Hambleton, for example, we found that the retro-activity period was \u201crationally related to preventing the fiscal shortfall.\u201d Hambleton, 181 Wn.2d at 827. Noting that the eight-year retroactivity period at issue was \u201cnot far outside other retroactive periods that courts have accepted,\u201d we upheld the retroactive application of the amendment against a due process challenge because it was \u201cdirectly linked with the purpose of the amendment, which [was] to remedy the effects of Bracken\u201d Id. Furthermore, we observed that any shorter retroactivity period would have been arbitrary because \u201c[i]t would allow some estates to escape the tax while similarly situated estates would be subject to it.\u201d Id. This illustrates that it is the function\u2014 rather than the length\u2014of a retroactivity period that should determine whether it comports with due process protections.\n\u00b626 In this case, the actual retroactive effect of the amendment as applied to Dot Foods is rationally related to the legislature\u2019s legitimate, stated purpose of \u201cprevent [ing] the loss of revenues resulting from the expanded interpretation of the exemption.\u201d Laws of 2010, 1st Spec. Sess., ch. 23, \u00a7 401(4). Consequently, there is no due process violation.\nB. Collateral Estoppel Claim\n\u00b627 Dot Foods asserts that the May 2006 through December 2007 interim tax periods are encompassed by the judgment in Dot Foods I, which prevents the Department from assessing B&O taxes against it under the 2010 amendment pursuant to collateral estoppel. Dot Foods also asserts that there is statutory support for its collateral estoppel claim in section 1706 of the amending statute, which explicitly preserves final judgments, Laws of 2010, 1st Spec. Sess., ch 23. We do not find support for these arguments in our case law and hold that collateral estoppel does not apply in this case.\ni. Dot Foods fails to meet the requirements for collateral estoppel\n\u00b628 The collateral estoppel doctrine \u201cmay be applied to preclude only those issues that have actually been litigated and necessarily and finally determined in the earlier proceeding.\u201d Christensen v. Grant County Hosp. Dist. No. 1, 152 Wn.2d 299, 307, 96 P.3d 957 (2004). To invoke collateral estoppel, Dot Foods must establish that (1) the issue decided in Dot Foods I was identical to the issue that is presented to us now, (2) the prior action ended in a final judgment on the merits, (3) the Department was a party or in privity with a party in the prior action, and (4) application of the doctrine would not work an injustice. Id. \u201cFailure to establish any one element is fatal\u201d to a collateral estoppel claim. Lopez-Vasquez v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 168 Wn. App. 341, 345, 276 P.3d 354 (2012). Because Dot Foods cannot satisfy the first requirement, collateral estoppel does not apply.\n\u00b629 Both the facts and the applicable law in this case are distinguishable from Dot Foods I. The dispute in Dot Foods I arose out of Dot Foods\u2019 refund request for the tax periods from January 2000 through April 2006, and the legal issue was whether Dot Foods qualified for the direct seller\u2019s exemption under former RCW 82.04.423. Dot Foods I, 166 Wn.2d at 919. Dot Foods neither alleges nor establishes that the subsequent interim tax periods from May 2006 through December 2007 were directly at issue or actually litigated in Dot Foods I. In fact, Dot Foods itself acknowledges that \u201cthe periods directly at issue in the prior appeal\u201d were January 2000 through April 2006, CP at 359, and that the interim tax periods fall outside the scope of Dot Foods I, Dot Foods\u2019 Reply Br. at 8.\n\u00b630 Dot Foods asserts that under collateral estoppel principles, the decision in Dot Foods I should extend to the interim tax periods because the prior tax appeal adjudicated Dot Foods\u2019 exempt status under former RCW 82.04-.423. Id. at 44. Nothing in the statute or our case law supports this assertion. To the contrary, tax appeals are very limited causes of action. Under RCW 82.32.180, tax appeals are confined to the specific taxes and associated time periods identified by the aggrieved taxpayer. Thus, although Dot Foods I and the present case concern the same taxable activity, different tax periods are involved.\n\u00b631 The United States Supreme Court and federal circuit courts have declined to apply collateral estoppel in federal tax cases involving identical taxable transactions that occur in subsequent taxing periods. See Harvie Branscomb, Jr., Collateral Estoppel in Tax Cases: Static and Separable Facts, 37 Tex. L. Rev. 584, 587 (1959). In Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 598, 68 S. Ct. 715, 92 L. Ed. 898 (1948), the Court determined that separate tax periods give rise to separate causes of action for collateral estoppel purposes. The Court held that the United States Tax Court was not bound by a prior decision of the United States Board of Tax Appeals, reasoning that where a subsequent proceeding relates to a different taxing period, \u201cthe prior judgment acts as a collateral estoppel only as to those matters in the second proceeding which were actually presented and determined in the first suit.\u201d Id.\n\u00b632 Dot Foods contends that Sunnen is inapplicable because it deals with the federal income tax, which is assessed annually, as opposed to continuously on a monthly basis like Washington\u2019s B&O tax. Dot Foods\u2019 Resp. Br. at 42. However, the federal courts have extended Sunnen specifically to cases involving excise tax liability. In Smith v. United States, 242 F.2d 486, 488 (5th Cir. 1957), the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[e]ach month, then, is the origin of a new liability and of a separate cause of action.\u201d Applying Sunnen, the court stated that \u201cit is clear that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply since the instant suit does not involve the same claim and the same taxable periods as were involved in the prior action.\u201d Id.\n\u00b633 Regardless of the different taxes involved, the broader rationale of Sunnen is compelling:\nA taxpayer may secure a judicial determination of a particular tax matter, a matter which may recur without substantial variation for some years thereafter. But a subsequent modification of the significant facts or a change or development in the controlling legal principles may make that determination obsolete or erroneous, at least for future purposes. If such a determination is then perpetuated each succeeding year as to the taxpayer involved in the original litigation, he is accorded a tax treatment different from that given to other taxpayers of the same class. As a result, there are inequalities in the administration of the revenue laws, discriminatory distinctions in tax liability, and a fertile basis for litigious confusion.\nSunnen, 333 U.S. at 599. The Court further observed that collateral estoppel is meant to apply only in situations that \u201chave remained substantially static, factually and legally.\u201d Id. This reflects the well-established principle that an \u201c \u2018intervening change in the applicable legal context\u2019 \u201d\u2014 such as the retroactive amendment in this case\u2014prohibits the application of collateral estoppel. Hambleton, 181 Wn.2d at 835 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 28(2)(b) (Am. Law Inst. 1982)). The facts following Dot Foods I were not static, factually or legally. Factually, a different tax period was at issue, and legally, there was an intervening change in the law that narrowed the scope of the exemption in such a way that excluded Dot Foods. In fact, Dot Foods concedes that if the amendment applies retroactively, it would not be able to satisfy the requirements for invoking collateral estoppel. Dot Foods\u2019 Resp. Br. at 37 (\u201cHad the [legislature not changed the law retroactively, Dot Foods would have met the 4-part test for collateral estoppel.\u201d).\n\u00b634 Sunnen and earlier federal cases established that determinations about tax liability for one taxing period under then-applicable statutes do not control decisions regarding subsequent taxing periods under amended statutes. We find the reasoning of these cases persuasive and hold that collateral estoppel does not apply to subsequent taxing periods that were not previously adjudicated.\nii. Section 1706 does not extend the judgment in Dot Foods I to the subsequent interim tax periods\n\u00b635 The traditional application of issue preclusion principles adequately addresses the collateral estoppel claim, but Dot Foods also asserts a statutory basis for the preclusive effect of the judgment in Dot Foods I. The amending statute explicitly provides that the substantive amendment to RCW 82.04.423 \u201cdoes not affect any final judgments, not subject to appeal, entered by a court of competent jurisdiction before the effective date of this section.\u201d Laws of 2010, 1st Spec. Sess., ch. 23, \u00a7 1706. This section has the effect of preserving the judgment in Dot Foods I only as to the tax periods actually litigated in that case. Perhaps anticipating that it could not satisfy the requirements for collateral estoppel, Dot Foods asserts that collateral estoppel is \u201cbuilt into the 2010 legislative amendment\u201d under section 1706. CP at 469.\n\u00b636 The trial court properly rejected this argument, observing that \u201cthe 2006 to 2007 refund request was not a \u2018final judgment\u2019 when the amendment went into effect. Indeed, that matter is currently \u2018subject to appeal\u2019 in this very case.\u201d Id. at 470. As discussed above, Dot Foods cannot show\u2014and in fact admits\u2014that the interim period was not directly at issue or actually litigated in Dot Foods I. Because a refund for the interim period was not reduced to a final judgment prior to the date that the 2010 amendment went into effect, section 1706 is not implicated.\nC. Separation of Powers Claim\n\u00b637 \u201cThe legislature violates separation of powers principles when it infringes on a judicial function.\u201d Hambleton, 181 Wn.2d at 817-18 (citing Haberman v. Wash. Pub. Power Supply Sys., 109 Wn.2d 107, 143, 744 P.2d 1032, 750 P.2d 254 (1987)). We have recognized \u201cthat a retroactive legislative amendment that rejects a judicial interpretation would give rise to separation of powers concerns\u201d but have been willing to uphold such amendments where \u201cthe legislature was careful not to reverse our decision.\u201d Hale v. Wellpinit Sch. Dist. No. 49, 165 Wn.2d 494, 508, 510, 198 P.3d 1021 (2009).\n\u00b638 Dot Foods cannot point to any evidence that the legislature intended to affect or curtail the judgment in Dot Foods I. In fact, as discussed above, the legislature explicitly preserved prior judgments in section 1706 and we upheld a retroactive amendment with language identical to section 1706 against a separation of powers challenge in Hambleton, 181 Wn.2d at 817. Furthermore, as also discussed above, the judgment in Dot Foods I does not encompass the interim period at issue now; therefore, retroactive application of the amendment to this period does not run afoul of the separation of powers doctrine.\nConclusion\n\u00b639 We have previously observed that \u201cOccasionally, try as the court may, the legislature is disappointed with the court\u2019s interpretation.\u201d Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 509. It is entirely within the proper function of the legislature to amend laws in response to our decisions. This is how the lawmaking process is meant to work.\n\u00b640 In amending RCW 82.04.423(2), the legislature was careful to avoid trespassing on the judicial function by explicitly preserving any final judgments prior to the effective date of the amendment. Our jurisprudence requires us to show the legislature equal respect in this case by upholding the retroactive application of this amendment as to Dot Foods for the tax periods not encompassed by our prior decision in Dot Foods I.\n\u00b641 We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the collateral estoppel and separation of powers arguments, but we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to grant Dot Foods\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the due process claim. In doing so, we hold that the retroactive application of the amendment to RCW 82.04.423 applies to the May 2006 through December 2007 interim tax periods, and that Dot Foods is liable for the B&O tax for this time period.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Gordon McCloud, JJ., concur.\nAfter modification, further reconsideration denied April 28, 2016.\nSee Tyler Pipe Indus., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 105 Wn.2d 318, 715 P.2d 123 (1986), vacated, 483 U.S. 232, 107 S. Ct. 2810, 97 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1987) (invalidating Washington\u2019s B&O tax scheme); Nat\u2019l Can Corp. v.

CP at 56, 80. Dot Poods\u2019 refund request was for just over $500,000, Dot Foods\u2019 Resp. Br. at 9, indicating that other taxpayers would be affected by the 2010 amendment\u2014not just Dot Foods. This supports the conclusion that the legislature was not improperly targeting Dot Foods but was enacting a statute of general application.\nWe invalidated a four-year retroactivity period in Pacific Telephone based solely on a reference to \u201c \u201cprior but recent transactions.\u2019 \" Pac. Tel., 9 Wn.2d at 17 (quoting Welch v. Henry, 223 Wis. 319, 271 N.W. 68, 72 (1937)). Pacific Telephone did not specify or cite to an absolute constitutional limit on retroactivity and provides no insight into why a hard-line rule should apply.\nSee Monteith Bros. Co. v. United States, 142 F.2d 139, 140 (7th Cir. 1944) (\u201c [Although the transactions involved in different years were similar, they were not identical, and must therefore be studied in the light of the law and facts of the year involved.\u201d); Henricksen v.

        "text": "Yu, J.\n\u00b61 This case involves the question of whether reviewing jury questionnaires for hardship implicates the public trial right. On each of the first two days of jury selection in this case, the trial judge, the attorneys, and petitioner Frederick David Russell held work sessions to review juror questionnaires and to separate the hardship juror requests from the others. These work sessions occurred in the jury room, rather than in the courtroom, and the trial court did not conduct a Bone-Club analysis on the record before holding the work sessions.\n\u00b62 Russell contends that the work sessions violated the public trial right guaranteed by article I, sections 10 and 22 of our state constitution and that his convictions should therefore be reversed. The Court of Appeals rejected that contention, as do we. The public trial right was not implicated, and we affirm the Court of Appeals.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\u00b63 On June 4, 2001, Russell had been drinking alcohol and, at about 10:35 p.m., was driving well above the speed limit, straddling both sides of a two-lane highway in a no-passing zone. Russell sideswiped a green Geo that was traveling in the opposite direction, then crashed head-on into a Cadillac that was behind the green Geo. The crash instantly killed the Cadillac\u2019s driver and two passengers and severely injured three other passengers, leaving them with permanent disabilities. Russell\u2019s car then hit a red Geo that was behind the Cadillac. Russell, his passenger, and the red Geo\u2019s driver were able to get out of their cars before both cars caught fire.\n\u00b64 Russell was arrested the morning after the accident. He posted bail but did not return for a pretrial hearing in October 2001. Russell was eventually captured in Ireland in 2005. In 2006, he was extradited back to the United States. Due to extensive pretrial publicity throughout eastern Washington, the trial court granted Russell\u2019s motion to change venue. Whitman County\u2019s only superior court judge traveled across the state to Cowlitz County to preside over the guilt phase of the trial, which was estimated to take three to four weeks. 9 Tr. of Proceedings (TrP) (Oct. 15, 2007) at 1304-05, 1312.\n\u00b65 Before trial, Russell requested \u201cthe use of a written juror questionnaire, comprised of questions presented by both parties, to be filled out by all prospective jurors before oral questioning is to commence by the Court or the parties.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 1105. Consistent with this request, when prospective jurors arrived for jury duty, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire before being called into the courtroom. The questionnaire was duplicated for review by the judge and counsel. 9 TrP at 1294.\n\u00b66 While waiting for the juror questionnaires to be completed and copied, the court went through some preliminary matters on the record in open court. The jury was not present, id., and it is not apparent from the record whether any members of the media or the public were in the courtroom. The judge announced that he, the attorneys, and Russell had held an in-chambers conference, id., where they had agreed to have a work session \u201cin the jury room going through those [questionnaires] and trying to week [sic] out those that will automatically be excused for hardship purposes,\u201d id. at 1297. The court clerk then brought two prospective jurors to the court\u2019s attention \u2014 one who was disqualified, possibly due to illness (although it is not entirely clear from the record), and another who had brought her child with her \u2014 and the judge excused both jurors in open court without objection. Id. at 1301-02. It appears from the record that the prospective jurors were in another room (not the courtroom) and that the courtroom clerk was communicating with court staff who were in that prospective juror holding room. The attorneys then confirmed there were no other preliminary issues that needed to be addressed. Id. at 1303.\n\u00b67 Having concluded these preliminary discussions, the judge announced on the record in open court that \u201cwell be in recess and as soon as the questionnaires come in I\u2019ll let the attorneys get together in the jury room and I\u2019ll let Mr. Russell be there as well and we\u2019ll go through those to see \u2014 about hardship cases.\u201d Id. The court went into recess at 10:10 a.m. Id. The record does not indicate when precisely the work session in the jury room began, and there is no record of the work session itself. There is no indication whether the door to the jury room was open or closed during the work session or whether any member of the press or the public requested or was denied access to the session. There is no indication that any prospective jurors were questioned during the work session.\n\u00b68 The court reconvened at 12:19 p.m. Id. Thus, while the record does not state precisely how long the work session was, it could not have been longer than two hours and nine minutes. It is not apparent from the record whether the panel of 76 prospective jurors was brought into the courtroom before or after the judge, the attorneys, and Russell reentered the courtroom. Id. The judge stated the name of the case and those present in the courtroom for the record, introduced himself and the attorneys, and explained to the prospective jurors that the case had been transferred from Whitman County. Id. at 1303-06. He then explained that he had gone through the juror questionnaires with the attorneys and Russell to look for \u201csevere hardship issues ... [a]nd very shortly here I am going to go through the list of \u2014 jurors that will automatically be excluded or excused from this case \u2014 because of hardship reasons.\u201d Id. at 1307. The judge also noted that \u201csome of you that listed hardships will not automatically be excluded \u2014 there\u2019ll be some further inquiry and then the Court will be making the decision.\u201d Id.\n\u00b69 After thanking all the jurors for coming in and stressing the value of their service, id. at 1307-09, the judge announced jurors who would be excused for hardship without any oral questioning, id. at 1309-10. Those jurors were not excused from juror service altogether \u2014 they remained \u201con call for other Cowlitz County cases.\u201d Id. at 1309. The judge instructed those who had not been excused \u201cto remain in attendance and \u2014 there will be some inquiries on other individuals that listed grounds that they felt were hardship and I want to inquire a little further here \u2014 very shortly here.\u201d Id. at 1310.\n\u00b610 The judge made preliminary remarks, id. at 1311-26, and administered the oath to the remaining jurors, id. at 1327. He then orally questioned jurors who had requested to be excused for \u201chardship reasons or based on employment-type reasons\u201d but had not already been excused based on their questionnaires. Id. The judge first addressed the concerns of jurors with physical impairments. Id. at 1329-32, 1336, 1337-43, 1356-58, 1365. The judge excused some jurors who would not be able to sit comfortably for extended periods but reiterated that the excused jurors would need to \u201ccheck back in\u201d because the court \u201cmight try to get you in a shorter case.\u201d Id. at 1358.\n\u00b611 The judge also questioned jurors who had preexisting commitments and employment-related issues that might make it a hardship to serve for the Ml three-to-four-week trial. Id. at 1333-34, 1344-46, 1349-56, 1358-69, 1372. The judge decided some of those issues after talking to the jurors, and he deferred decision on others pending a discussion with the attorneys. He also requested that some jurors look into making alternate arrangements and report back the next day.\n\u00b612 The judge then announced he would step into the hallway with the attorneys and Russell for an on-the-record sidebar discussion regarding the remaining hardship requests. Id. at 1372-83. Russell\u2019s attorney generally took a broad approach, supporting excusal of jurors who might \u201chave distractions.\u201d Id. at 1377. The judge, the attorneys, and Russell then returned to the courtroom, and the judge excused two more jurors for hardship. Id. at 1381, 1383.\n\u00b613 Before dismissing the remaining jurors for the evening, the judge noted on the record that there was a \u201ctelevision camera\u201d and \u201cother members of the media\u201d present, but the record does not indicate how long they had been there or if there were any other members of the public present. Id. at 1387. The judge instructed the prospective jurors not to discuss the case among themselves or with anyone else and to avoid all media coverage of the case, id. at 1386-88, and dismissed them for the evening, id. at 1390. To ensure there would be enough jurors, the judge requested 15 additional jurors for the next day, who would fill out the same questionnaire and be subject to the same hardship excusal process. Id. at 1521-22.\n\u00b614 The next day, the court began with an in-court, on-the-record hearing outside the jurors\u2019 presence regarding pretrial evidentiary motions. 10 TrP (Oct. 16, 2007) at 1529. Meanwhile, the 15 newly summoned jurors filled out their questionnaires, which were again copied for review by the judge and counsel. Id. at 1537. The judge announced on the record in open court that they would have another work session to \u201cgo through and do like we did yesterday or at least determine hardships\u201d once those questionnaires were copied. Id. The record does not indicate whether any members of the media or the public were in the courtroom when the judge made that announcement. The court then resumed hearing pretrial motions.\n\u00b615 The clerk notified the judge that the 15 new jurors had completed their questionnaires. Id. at 1543. After some further argument on pretrial motions, the court noted it was now nine o\u2019clock, asked about the questionnaires, id. at 1562, and announced that \u201c[o]nce they\u2019re all copied we\u2019ll take a break and review those,\u201d id. at 1563. After confirming with the clerk that all the new jurors\u2019 questionnaires had been copied, id. at 1567, the judge announced the court would recess for another work session, \u201cretire to the jury room briefly [,] and try to sort out the hardship requests,\u201d id. at 1570.\n\u00b616 The court recessed at 9:08 a.m., id., and there is no indication in the record whether any members of the public or the media were present in courtroom at that time. The record does not indicate whether the work session began immediately or after a break, and there is no record of the work session itself. There is no indication whether the door to the jury room was open or closed during the work session or whether any member of the press or the public requested or was denied access to the session. There is no indication that any prospective jurors were questioned during the work session.\n\u00b617 The court reconvened at 10:08 a.m. Id. Thus, while the record does not indicate precisely how long the work session was, it could not have lasted more than one hour. It is not apparent from the record whether the prospective jurors were brought into the courtroom before or after the judge, the attorneys, and Russell reentered the courtroom. Id. The clerk announced court was back in session, id., and the judge explained to the new jurors that the trial was expected to last three to four weeks and \u201ca couple of the issues that were addressed \u2014 in the jury questionnaire related to \u2014 hardship issues; whether or not it would create a hardship for a particular juror to have to serve \u2014 for a lengthy period of time in this case.\u201d Id. at 1571.\n\u00b618 The judge then explained that he had gone through the questionnaires with the attorneys and announced on the record in open court which of the 15 newly summoned jurors would be excused for hardship without oral questioning. Id. at 1572-73. No jurors who had been there the day before were excused immediately after the second work session. Id. at 1573. The judge told the excused jurors that they would need to check back in with the bailiff because they \u201cmay be called in for another trial, a shorter trial.\u201d Id. The judge then questioned other jurors who had made hardship requests, revisited those jurors who had needed to look into alternate arrangements, and issued oral decisions on the record in open court. Id. at 1574-81.\n\u00b619 After the preliminary hardship determinations were concluded, the judge made preliminary remarks for the benefit of the new jurors, id. at 1581-97, and administered the oath to all those who had not been there the day before, id. at 1594. Then the court turned voir dire questioning over to the attorney for the State. Id. at 1597. Attorney voir dire took place on October 16, 17, and 18. At the end of the day on October 18, the attorneys exercised peremptory challenges and the final jury was announced.\n\u00b620 Trial lasted until November 6, 2007. 28 TrP (Nov. 6, 2007) at 5175. The jury convicted Russell of three counts of vehicular homicide and three counts of vehicular assault. The Court of Appeals affirmed Russell\u2019s convictions, holding that the work sessions on the first two days of jury selection did not implicate Russell\u2019s public trial right because those sessions were concerned only with excus\u00e1is for general hardship considerations, rather than case-specific, for-cause or peremptory challenges. See State v. Russell, noted at 161 Wn. App. 1002, slip op. at 47-55 (2011). The Court of Appeals remanded the case for the sole purpose of granting Russell credit for the time he spent in detention in Ireland while he was challenging extradition.\n\u00b621 This court deferred consideration of Russell\u2019s petition for review pending final decisions in State v. Sublett, 176 Wn.2d 58, 292 P.3d 715 (2012) (plurality opinion), State v. Slert, 181 Wn.2d 598, 334 P.3d 1088 (2014) (plurality opinion), and State v. Njonge, 181 Wn.2d 546, 334 P.3d 1068 (2014). On February 4, 2015, we granted Russell\u2019s petition for review only as to the public trial issues. 182 Wn.2d 1001, 342 P.3d 326 (2015).\nISSUES\n\u00b622 A. Did the trial court\u2019s work sessions in the jury room with the attorneys and Russell to review juror questionnaires for hardship issues implicate the public trial right?\n\u00b623 B. Should this court revisit its application of the structural error doctrine in public trial rights cases?\nANALYSIS\n\u00b624 Experience and logic show that the public trial right was not implicated by the two work sessions regarding preliminary hardship issues raised by the juror questionnaires, and we affirm the Court of Appeals. In light of this determination, we will not revisit our approach to structural error at this time.\nA. The public trial right was not implicated by the work sessions\n\u00b625 Where there is no directly controlling precedent determining whether the public trial right is implicated by a particular proceeding, we use the experience and logic test. Njonge, 181 Wn.2d at 553-54. Neither experience nor logic indicates that the public trial right is implicated by work sessions to review juror questionnaires for hardship issues.\n1. There is no indication that proceedings like the work sessions held in this case have historically been open to the press and the public\n\u00b626 As Russell correctly argues, jury selection, and particularly voir dire, implicates the right to a public trial. State v. Brightman, 155 Wn.2d 506, 515, 122 P.3d 150 (2005). However, \u201cjury selection\u201d encompasses significantly more than attorney voir dire, and the mere label of \u201cjury selection\u201d does not mean the public trial right is automatically implicated. State v. Wilson, 174 Wn. App. 328, 338, 298 P.3d 148 (2013). Relevant cases, statutes, and court rules show that, as a matter of experience, Russell\u2019s public trial right was not implicated when the judge, Russell, and the attorneys held work sessions to review juror questionnaires for hardship.\n\u00b627 The public trial right is not implicated by preliminary excus\u00e1is for statutory reasons (including hardship) based on juror questionnaires. See Slert, 181 Wn.2d at 605-06 (Gonz\u00e1lez, J., lead opinion), 614 (Stephens, J., dissenting). Determining whether a juror is able to serve at a particular time or for a particular duration (as in hardship and administrative excus\u00e1is) is qualitatively different from challenging a juror\u2019s ability to serve as a neutral fact finder in a particular case (as in peremptory and for-cause challenges). See In re Pers. Restraint of Coggin, 182 Wn.2d 115, 117, 340 P.3d 810 (2014) (C. Johnson, J., lead opinion); In re Pers. Restraint of Speight, 182 Wn.2d 103, 105, 340 P.3d 207 (2014) (C. Johnson, J., lead opinion); cf. State v. Irby, 170 Wn.2d 874, 882, 246 P.3d 796 (2011) (drawing the distinction in the context of the defendant\u2019s right to be present). In addition to our own case law, this distinction is supported by the statutes and rules regarding juror selection proceedings. See GR 28(a) (setting forth \u201cprocedures for postponing and excusing jury service under RCW 2.36.100 and 2.36.110 and for disqualifying potential jurors under RCW 2.36.070\u201d), (b)(3) (explicitly distinguishing between excusal for statutory reasons and \u201cperemptory challenges or challenges for cause that fall outside the scope of this rule\u201d); CrR 6.4 (governing voir dire, challenges for cause, and peremptory challenges).\n\u00b628 We must \u201cconsider the actual proceeding at issue for what it is, without having to force every situation into predefined factors,\u201d Sublett, 176 Wn.2d at 73 (C. Johnson, J., lead opinion). The record indicates that the actual proceedings here \u2014 the work sessions \u2014 consisted of the trial judge, Russell, and the attorneys sitting in the jury room and reviewing the jurors\u2019 written questionnaires for potential hardship issues. No jurors were questioned during those work sessions. The judge announced all his excusal decisions in open court and clearly stated that the excus\u00e1is immediately following the work sessions were based on hardship. Those jurors were not disqualified or excused from service altogether \u2014 the judge mentioned several times on the record that they might be called back to serve on a shorter case. And the judge did question many jurors about hardship in open court, strongly indicating that the judge did not excuse any juror without oral questioning unless the judge, the attorneys, and Russell agreed that excusal for hardship was justified based on the questionnaire alone. Cf. In re Det. of Morgan, 180 Wn.2d 312, 326, 330 P.3d 774 (2014) (holding the experience prong is not met for proceedings \u201cakin to a status conference\u201d).\n\u00b629 Proceedings like the work sessions here have not historically been open to the press or general public. The experience prong is not met.\n2. Logic does not require work sessions to review juror questionnaires for hardship issues to be conducted in open court\n\u00b630 As a matter of logic, the purposes of the public trial right would not be served by requiring work sessions like the ones at issue here to be conducted in open court. No jurors were questioned during the work sessions, so the purposes of discouraging perjury and encouraging witnesses to come forward would not be advanced. See id. at 325. The trial judge announced the work sessions before they occurred, explained what occurred during the work sessions afterward, announced all his decisions in open court, and specified that the excus\u00e1is were based on hardship. The work sessions therefore did not involve the kind of secret decision-making that would undermine legitimacy or public confidence injudicial proceedings. See id. The judge\u2019s announcements on the record, coupled with Russell\u2019s personal participation in the work sessions, also served to remind the court and the attorneys of their duties to Russell and to the public. See id.\n\u00b631 Neither the experience nor the logic prong is met, and the public trial right was not implicated by the work sessions. To avoid appeals like this one, we strongly encourage trial courts to conduct all proceedings in open court (or conduct on-the-record Bone-Club analyses before removing any proceedings from open court), even if the public trial right is not (or is unlikely to be) implicated.\nB. We do not revisit our application of the structural error doctrine in this case\n\u00b632 The State and allied amici urge us to revisit our application of the structural error doctrine in public trial cases. Any such discussion would be unnecessary to the resolution of this case, and we decline to reconsider the structural error doctrine as applied to the public trial right in dicta.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b633 The public trial right was not implicated by the work sessions the trial court held with Russell and the attorneys to review the juror questionnaires for hardship issues. We affirm the Court of Appeals.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Fairhuest, Wiggins, and Gonz\u00e1lez, JJ., concur.\nState v. Bone-Club, 128 Wn.2d 254, 906 P.2d 325 (1995).\nNo juror questionnaires \u2014 either blank or completed \u2014 are in the record before this court.\nThe judge also addressed issues including the State\u2019s motion to amend the information, Russell\u2019s not-guilty pleas, and anticipated juror seating arrangements. 9 TrP at 1294-1300.\nRussell does not assign error to the sidebar discussion.\nOne juror\u2019s initial hardship request was deferred. 10 TrP (Oct. 16, 2007) at 1579-80. Later, during attorney voir dire, the juror revealed an employment-related financial burden and she was excused for hardship at that time. 12 TrP (Oct. 17, 2007) at 1908-10.\nTo the extent Russell speculates that the public trial right was implicated because other matters may have come up during the work sessions, see Am. Pet. for Review at 15, it is his burden on appeal to provide a record showing that the public trial right was implicated, State v. Koss, 181 Wn.2d 493, 503, 334 P.3d 1042 (2014). He has not done so.\nNjonge considered the public trial right implications of juror hardship excus\u00e1is, but we resolved that case with a holding that the record did not establish that the hardship determination process was closed to the public. 181 Wn.2d at 558.",

        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b634 (concurring in result) \u2014 The single question presented in this case is whether the right to open justice and a public courtroom applies to preliminary hardship determinations based on written jury questionnaires, where, as here, the judge memorializes those decisions immediately afterward on the record in open court. I agree with the majority that the answer to that question is no.\n\u00b635 However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s additional dicta and I write separately to make clear that it is unnecessary to our decision in this case.\n\u00b636 First, the majority makes clear that the two preliminary hardship determination discussions at issue occurred outside of the courtroom, in a separate \u201c \u2018jury room/ \u201d during what was clearly a recess. Majority at 723-24 (quoting 9 Tr. of Proceedings (TrP) (Oct. 15, 2007) at 1297 (portion of transcript showing that court recessed at 10:10 a.m. and reconvened at 12:19 p.m. and that the jury room session occurred in the interim)). In fact, the second such jury room discussion is characterized by the trial judge himself as something that would occur after he \u201c \u2018retire [d]\u2019 \u201d to that \u201c \u2018jury room.\u2019 \u201d Majority at 727 (quoting 10 TrP (Oct. 16, 2007) at 1570). But the majority then twice calls out the fact that the transcript is silent about whether the door to that jury room was open or closed during this recess and even characterizes it as a \u201cwork session\u201d rather than a recess. Id. at 724 (\u201cThere is no indication whether the door to the jury room was open or closed during the work session or whether any member of the press or the public requested or was denied access to the session.\u201d), 727 (\u201cThere is no indication whether the door to the jury room was open or closed during the work session . . . .\u201d).\n\u00b637 The majority\u2019s citations to the record are certainly accurate. But they are irrelevant and therefore misleading. They tend to imply that whether the door to a jury room or judge\u2019s chambers is open or closed is relevant to determining whether a proceeding that occurs in there \u2014 during a \u201crecess\u201d when the parties and the court \u201cretired\u201d to that location \u2014 is really open or closed. That is incorrect. We have held that retiring to such a separate and presumptively private setting outside of the public courtroom constitutes a courtroom closure. In State v. Frawley, 181 Wn.2d 452, 334 P.3d 1022 (2014) (plurality opinion), for example, we considered two consolidated cases raising courtroom closure issues. In one of them, the judge and counsel retired to the judge\u2019s chambers to conduct certain voir dire proceedings\u2014 and we began by addressing whether that constituted a courtroom closure. We noted that the record showed that the door to the judge\u2019s chambers was open, the judge purposely left it open, and the judge subjectively characterized his decision to leave the door open as somehow creating another open courtroom in chambers: \u201cThe court stated multiple times throughout this discussion and at the in-chambers questioning of the juror that the individual questioning had to and did remain a public proceeding. During the in-chambers questioning, the judge stated for the record, \u2018The inner and outer door to my chambers are open. The courtroom door is closed, but this must remain a public proceeding.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 457-58 & n.6. But we rejected the notion that keeping the door open to that separate, private room created a little public courtroom right there in chambers. Instead, we treated it as a case in which the courtroom was closed. Id. at 460 (\u201cIn both cases, the in-chambers questioning of jurors constituted a closure of the courtroom under [State v.] Wise, 176 Wn.2d 1[, 288 P.3d 1113 (2012)].\u201d). The court decided that case, instead, on waiver issues.\n\u00b638 If leaving the door to chambers open did not create an open-chambers courtroom in that case, then silence about leaving the doors to the jury room open cannot create an open-jury-room courtroom in this case. Retiring to a jury deliberation room, like retiring to chambers, is leaving the courtroom, and the public, behind.\n\u00b639 Next, the majority discusses structural error \u2014 even though it finds no error in the first place. The majority certainly does not depart from our settled precedent applying structural error analysis to courtroom closure errors. But it states that the reason it adheres to precedent is because the case did not present a proper vehicle for revisiting that precedent. Majority at 729 (\u201cIn light of this determination [that the public trial right does not attach to juror hardship determinations], we will not revisit our approach to structural error at this time\u201d), 733 (\u201cwe decline to reconsider the structural error doctrine as applied to the public trial right in dicta\u201d).\n\u00b640 I agree that we need not address what type of error occurred because no error occurred. But I disagree with the dicta that undermines our structural error jurisprudence. We have treated violations of the constitutional public trial right as structural error, in criminal cases, for the last 20 years, since State v. Bone-Club, 128 Wn.2d 254, 906 P.2d 325 (1995). See, e.g., State v. Paumier, 176 Wn.2d 29, 33, 288 P.3d 1126 (2012); Wise, 176 Wn.2d at 7; State v. Strode, 167 Wn.2d 222, 217 P.3d 310 (2009) (plurality opinion); State v. Easterling, 157 Wn.2d 167, 137 P.3d 825 (2006).\n\u00b641 I therefore respectfully disagree with the dicta in the majority\u2019s opinion. But I concur in the result.\nStephens, J., concurs with Gordon McCloud, J.\nAs we all agree, the right to a public trial is guaranteed by both the Washington (Const, art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 22) and United States (U.S. Const, amends. I, VI) Constitutions.",

        "text": "f 1 In 2013, the legislature amended the Estate and Transfer Tax Act, chapter 83.100 RCW, in response to our decision in In re Estate of Bracken, 175 Wn.2d 549, 290 P.3d 99 (2012), in which we narrowly-construed the term \u201ctransfer.\u201d The amendment allows the Department of Revenue (DOR) to tax qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) as part of a surviving spouse\u2019s estate. A QTIP trust is created by a deceased spouse and gives the surviving spouse a life interest in the income or use of trust property. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(i)-(ii). The advantage of QTIP trusts is that no estate tax is paid on the death of the first spouse; the property is taxed only upon the death of the surviving spouse.\nWiggins, J.\n\u00b62 In these consolidated cases, the estates of Hambleton and Macbride (collectively Estates) challenge the amendment on a variety of grounds. We reject the Estates\u2019 challenges and reverse summary judgment in In re Estate of Hambleton, No. 89419-1, and affirm the summary judgment in In re Estate of Macbride, No. 89500-7.\nBackground\n\u00b63 A brief discussion of the history of Washington\u2019s current estate tax law, the Bracken decision, 175 Wn.2d 549, and the facts of the consolidated cases places this case in context.\nWashington Estate Tax Law Pre-Bracken\n\u00b64 For many years, Washington did not have an independent estate tax. Instead, Washington participated in a federal tax sharing system, referred to as \u201cpickup\u201d taxes. Id. at 557. Under the pickup tax system, the federal government became the principal estate tax collector in exchange for sharing with states a generous percentage of the amount collected. Id. In 2001, Congress passed legislation that gradually eliminated the pickup tax system. Id. at 558. Our legislature responded by \u201crevising] existing statutes to tie estate taxation to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as they existed [under the former pickup tax system], with DOR continuing to collect the same amount of tax as before.\u201d Id. at 558-59. We invalidated the revisions and instructed the legislature to either create a stand-alone estate tax or remain under the former pickup tax system. Id. at 559; Estate of Hemphill v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 153 Wn.2d 544, 551, 105 P.3d 391 (2005).\n\u00b65 In 2005, the legislature answered by enacting a stand-alone estate tax, the Estate and Transfer Tax Act (Act). Laws of 2005, ch. 516, \u00a7 1. The legislature modeled the stand-alone tax after the federal estate tax regime. See Bracken, 175 Wn.2d at 559. \u201cIt incorporates concepts and definitions from federal law and operates almost entirely in tandem with taxable estate and tax calculation and reporting for federal estate tax purposes.\u201d Id. For example, the \u201c Washington taxable estate\u2019 means the federal taxable estate, less: [specified deductions].\u201d Laws of 2005, ch. 516, \u00a7 2(13).\n\u00b66 Under federal law, Congress provides a deduction for QTIP trust assets. QTIP is property in a testamentary trust created by a deceased spouse for the benefit of the surviving spouse. The result of the deduction is that \u201c[t]he spouse who dies first controls the final disposition of the property, while allowing the surviving spouse to use the property or receive the income it generates, unreduced by front-end estate taxation.\u201d Bracken, 175 Wn.2d at 556. Typically, terminable interests, such as life estates, do not qualify for the marital tax deduction. See id. at 555. However, Congress created an exception for QTIP assets. The effect of the deduction is that the property is ultimately taxed, but the property is not taxed when the first spouse creates the life estate. Id. at 556. The transfer of property is taxed when the second spouse dies and the ultimate beneficiaries become present interest holders. Id.\n\u00b67 Estate taxes are excise taxes. West v. Okla. Tax Comm\u2019n, 334 U.S. 717, 727, 68 S. Ct. 1223, 92 L. Ed. 1676 (1948). Whether a tax is an excise tax or a direct tax is significant because the Washington State Constitution imposes a uniformity requirement on direct taxes, but the uniformity requirement does not apply to excise taxes. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 1; Dean v. Lehman, 143 Wn.2d 12, 25-26, 18 P.3d 523 (2001). A tax is an \u201cexcise\u201d or \u201ctransfer\u201d tax if the government is taxing \u201ca particular use or enjoyment of property or the shifting from one to another of any power or privilege incidental to the ownership or enjoyment of property.\u201d Fernandez v. Wiener, 326 U.S. 340, 352, 66 S. Ct. 178, 90 L. Ed. 116 (1945).\n\u00b68 The 2005 Act imposed a tax on \u201cevery transfer of property located in Washington\u201d and applied prospectively to estates of decedents dying on or after May 17, 2005. Laws of 2005, ch. 516, \u00a7\u00a7 3(1), 20. Therefore, a transfer (upon which the excise tax operates) must occur on or after May 17, 2005.\nEstate of Bracken\n\u00b69 In Bracken, we held that DOR overstepped its authority by adopting regulations that taxed QTIP assets when the deceased spouse died before the effective date of the 2005 Act. Bracken, 175 Wn.2d at 554; see Laws of 2005, ch. 516, \u00a7 20. In Bracken, the deceased spouses made QTIP elections under federal law before Washington enacted its stand-alone estate tax and the surviving spouses died after the legislature passed the Act. See 175 Wn.2d at 556, 561-62. The estate in Bracken argued that the taxable transfer occurred when the first spouse died (before the Act came into effect), while DOR argued that a taxable transfer occurred when the second spouse died (after the Act came into effect). See id. at 561-63.\nflO We interpreted \u201ctransfer\u201d narrowly and reasoned that the only \u201ctransfer\u201d occurred at the husbands\u2019 deaths when they created the QTIP trusts. See id. at 554, 563. Any transfers that occurred later upon the wives\u2019 deaths were fictional. Id. at 554. Therefore, DOR exceeded its authority under the Act, which requires a transfer, by creating regulations that allowed taxation of fictional transfers. Id. According to our interpretation in Bracken, the \u201creal\u201d transfers occurred before the 2005 estate law was enacted. DOR could not tax these transfers because the legislature declared that the Act was prospective only. See Laws of 2005, ch. 516, \u00a7 20. The court did not reach alleged constitutional issues because it construed the estate tax to apply only to real transfers. See 175 Wn.2d at 563.\n\u00b611 The concurring/dissenting opinion disagreed with the majority\u2019s narrow interpretation of \u201ctransfer.\u201d See id. at 576 (Madsen, C.J., concurring/dissenting). However, the concurring/dissenting opinion still agreed that the legislature did not intend to tax the QTIP, but for reasons differing from the majority. Id. at 594 (Madsen, C.J., concurring/ dissenting) (\u201cThe 2006 regulations on their face and according to their plain language effectuate the obvious purpose of the legislature\u2019s determination to allow a state QTIP election: the surviving spouses\u2019 estates are not subject to state estate taxation on federal estate QTIP elections that did not benefit the first spouses\u2019 estates on any state estate tax returns by allowing a state marital deduction when the first spouses died.\u201d). The concurring/dissenting justices noted that the legislature could amend the statute if it intended a different result, so long as the amendments did not offend the constitution. Id. at 594-95.\n\u00b612 The result of the Bracken decision was that the State could not tax the QTIP trusts created by spouses dying before the Act was enacted because the spouse did not make a state QTIP election. See id. at 554.\n2013 Amendments\n\u00b613 In 2013, the legislature responded to Bracken by amending the Act to tax QTIP assets upon the death of the surviving spouse. Laws or 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 2, \u00a7 1. Disagreeing with Bracken\u2019s narrow interpretation of the term \u201ctransfer,\u201d the legislature noted that under the federal estate tax code \u201ctransfer\u201d is \u201cconstrued broadly and extends to the \u2018shifting from one to another of any power or privilege incidental to the ownership or enjoyment of property\u2019 that occurs at death.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1(3) (quoting Fernandez, 326 U.S. at 352). The legislature also found that Bracken\n(a) Creates an inequity never intended by the legislature because unmarried individuals did not enjoy any similar opportunities to avoid or greatly reduce their potential Washington estate tax liability; and (b) may create disparate treatment between QTIP property and other property transferred between spouses that is eligible for the marital deduction.\nId. \u00a7 1(4). In response to its findings, the legislature broadened the meaning of \u201ctransfer\u201d to its \u201cbroadest possible meaning consistent with established United States supreme court precedents ...\u201d Id. \u00a7 1(5).\n\u00b614 The legislature intended for the amendments to \u201capply both prospectively and retroactively to all estates of decedents dying on or after May 17,2005.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9. However, the amendments do \u201cnot affect any final judgment, no longer subject to appeal, entered by a court of competent jurisdiction before the effective date of this section [, June 14, 2013]rid. \u00a7 10.\n\u00b615 The amendment modified the definition of \u201ctransfer.\u201d The definition of \u201ctransfer\u201d now reads, \u201c \u2018Transfer\u2019 means \u2018transfer\u2019 as used in section 2001 of the internal revenue code and includes any shifting upon death of the economic benefit in property or any power or legal privilege incidental to the ownership or enjoyment of property . . . .\u201d Id. \u00a7 2(12) (italics indicate added language). Section 2001 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) uses \u201ctransfer\u201d in the following context: \u201cA tax is hereby imposed on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen or resident of the United States.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2001(a).\n\u00b616 The legislature also amended the definition of the \u201cWashington taxable estate.\u201d The amended definition is, in relevant part, \u201cthe federal taxable estate and includes, but is not limited to, the value of any property included in the gross estate under section 2044 of the internal revenue code, regardless of whether the decedent\u2019s interest in such property was acquired before May 17, 2005 . . . .\u201d Laws of 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 2, \u00a7 2(14) (italics indicate added language). Section 2044 requires that QTIP assets be included in the value of the surviving spouse\u2019s gross estate. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2044(a).\n\u00b617 The legislature\u2019s amendments clarified the intent of the legislature to include QTIP trusts created before 2005 in the surviving spouse\u2019s Washington taxable estate (if the surviving spouse died after the Act\u2019s effective date).\n\u00b618 We now turn to the facts of the two cases before us.\nEstate of Hambleton\n\u00b619 Floyd Hambleton died on April 13, 2005, when there was no Washington estate tax in effect. His will left a testamentary trust for the benefit of his wife that qualified for the federal QTIP election. His estate made the federal QTIP election, but no such election existed under state law. His wife, Helen M. Hambleton, died on October 11, 2006. Helen\u2019s federal taxable estate included the value of the QTIP trust property, but the estate did not include the property in its Washington taxable estate. DOR disallowed a $4.7 million QTIP deduction and filed findings fixing the tax due. DOR is seeking an additional $1,184,989.16 in taxes. The estate filed objections to findings fixing the tax due and petitioned for declaratory and other relief. The parties agreed to stay the matter pending our decision in Bracken.\n\u00b620 Following Bracken, the estate filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Washington taxable estate could not include the federal QTIP election. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the estate, DOR appealed, and our court accepted certification under RAP 4.2.\nEstate of Macbride\n\u00b621 Thomas Macbride died on October 20,1999, leaving a QTIP marital deduction trust for the lifetime benefit of his wife, Jessie C. Macbride. His estate made a federal election under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(7). Jessie later died on October 21, 2007. The estate timely deposited funds with the State prior to filing either its federal or state estate tax returns. The estate paid taxes on the QTIP under protest and then sought a refund of $643,953, the taxes paid on the QTIP assets. The personal representatives brought this action for a refund, but the superior court granted summary judgment to DOR.\nf 22 The estate filed a notice of appeal, seeking review of the order denying summary judgment in favor of petitioners, the order affirming agency action, and the order denying a motion for reconsideration. After this court accepted review of Bracken (but before the court set a date for oral argument), DOR moved to stay review. The estate opposed the motion, and the Court of Appeals commissioner denied the motion. In the ruling, the commissioner explained that Bracken was not yet set for oral argument and the parties could seek to transfer the case to the Washington Supreme Court after briefing was complete. Thereafter, neither party sought transfer. After the Bracken argument was set, the commissioner asked the parties to brief whether the Court of Appeals should stay review pending resolution of Bracken. The record contains a response only from DOR. The commissioner stayed the appeal until our court resolved Bracken, whereupon we granted DOR\u2019s motion to transfer the case to this court and consolidate it with Hambleton.\nAnalysis\n\u00b623 The Estates challenge the 2013 amendments on a variety of grounds. The constitutional arguments focus on the separation of powers doctrine, due process clause (U.S. Const, amend XIV), impairment of contracts clause (U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1; Wash. Const, art. I, \u00a7 23), and article VII, section 1 of the state constitution. The ex post facto clauses of the state and federal constitutions apply only to penalties and, therefore, do not apply to taxes. See In re Pers. Restraint of Yates, 180 Wn.2d 33, 51, 321 P.3d 1195 (2014) (Gordon McCloud, J., concurring). The delegates to Washington\u2019s constitutional convention of 1889 could have included an ex post facto clause applicable to civil cases; they did not. Hence, the Estates rely on other constitutional clauses. We analyze this case under principles applicable to civil cases, not criminal cases.\n\u00b624 As a general rule, our state legislature possesses plenary power to tax except as limited by the constitution. Belas v. Kiga, 135 Wn.2d 913, 919-20, 959 P.2d 1037 (1998). We presume that statutes are constitutional and place \u201cthe burden to show unconstitutionality... on the challenger.\u201d Amunrud v. Bd. of Appeals, 158 Wn.2d 208, 215, 143 P.3d 571 (2006).\n\u00b625 The arguments unrelated to the constitution include estoppel, the statute of limitations, and the existence of a final judgment. We review questions of law de novo, as well as orders granting summary judgment. Cost Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. City of Lakewood, 178 Wn.2d 635, 641, 310 P.3d 804 (2013); Smith v. Safeco Ins. Co., 150 Wn.2d 478, 483, 78 P.3d 1274 (2003).\nSeparation of Powers\n\u00b626 We hold that the legislature did not intrude on judicial power when it retroactively amended the Estate and Transfer Tax Act. The legislature was careful not to affect the rights of any parties to a prior judgment, reopen a case, or interfere with any judicial function. See Lummi Indian Nation v. State, 170 Wn.2d 247, 263, 241 P.3d 1220 (2010).\n\u00b627 Our system of checks and balances incorporates the important concept of the separation of powers. Hale v. Wellpinit Sch. Dist. No. 49, 165 Wn.2d 494, 503, 506, 198 P.3d 1021 (2009). The doctrine \u201cpreserves the constitutional division between the three branches of government, ensuring that the activity of one does not threaten or invade the prerogatives of another.\u201d State v. Elmore, 154 Wn. App. 885, 905, 228 P.3d 760 (2010). The legislature violates separation of powers principles when it infringes on a judicial function. Haberman v. Wash. Pub. Power Supply Sys., 109 Wn.2d 107, 143, 744 P.2d 1032, 750 P.2d 254 (1987). The function of the judiciary is to say what the law is, whereas the legislature\u2019s function is to set policy and draft and enact law. Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 506. It is important to note that although the separate and coequal branches fill different roles, the branches \u201cmust remain partially intertwined to maintain an effective system of checks and balances. The art of good government requires cooperation and flexibility among the branches.\u201d Id. at 507.\n\u00b628 In Hale, the late Justice Tom Chambers wrote for a unanimous court when we rejected the argument that the legislature\u2019s retroactive amendment violated the separation of powers doctrine. Id. at 509-10. The facts grew out of McClarty v. Totem Electric, 157 Wn.2d 214, 137 P.3d 844 (2006). In McClarty, the court interpreted the term \u201cdisability\u201d in a way that limited the reach of Washington\u2019s Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), chapter 49.60 RCW. See Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 501. Just as the legislature responded to Bracken by retroactively changing the law, the legislature changed the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d announced by the court in McClarty. Id. at 501; see Laws of 2007, ch. 317, \u00a7 1. The amendment applied retroactively to all causes of actions occurring before the McClarty opinion was filed and prospectively to all causes of action occurring after the legislature passed the amendment. Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 502; Laws of 2007, ch. 317, \u00a7 1.\n\u00b6[29 The practical effects of the McClarty decision and the amendments on the parties in Hale were tangible. Hale was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 499. After we. decided McClarty, the trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of Hale\u2019s employer, the Wellpinit school district, because Hale\u2019s ailment did not qualify as a disability. See id. Shortly thereafter, the legislature amended the WLAD to include a broad definition of \u201cdisability.\u201d Id. at 500. Hale filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court denied, reasoning that applying the amendment retroactively would violate the separation of powers doctrine. Id. The trial judge then certified the issue to our court. Id. We unanimously held that applying the amendment retroactively to Hale did not intrude on judicial powers. Id. at 510.\n\u00b630 Justice Chambers explained that although it is the court\u2019s obligation to determine and carry out the intent of the legislature, the legislature is occasionally disappointed with the court\u2019s interpretation. Id. at 509. By amending the statute, \u201cthe legislature acted wholly within its sphere of authority to make policy, to pass laws, and to amend laws already in effect.\u201d Id. He noted, \u201cThe legislature was careful not to reverse our decision in McClarty nor did the legislature interfere with any judicial function.\u201d Id. at 510. He praised the cooperation between the legislature and the court, stating:\n[The court\u2019s interpretation of the statute and the legislature\u2019s responsive amendment] should serve as a model of how two separate and independent branches of government can work together in harmony and in the spirit of reciprocal deference to the other\u2019s important role and function in the art of governing.\nId.\n\u00b631 The court held similarly in Lummi Indian Nation, 170 Wn.2d at 262-63. The facts in Lummi Indian Nation arose out of Department of Ecology v. Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d 582, 957 P.2d 1241 (1998), and the legislature\u2019s subsequent amendment to municipal water law. See Lummi Indian Nation, 170 Wn.2d at 251. In Theodoratus, we held that under a then-existing statute, private water rights did not vest until the water was put to an \u201cactual beneficial use.\u201d Id. at 255. This was a departure from the Department of Ecology\u2019s practice of issuing permits and certificates based on a showing of need and capacity. Id. We cautioned that the opinion did not consider municipal water rights, which were treated differently under the law. Id. at 251, 255. The legislature responded to our opinion by amending the municipal water law to \u201cexplicitly define certain nongovernmental water suppliers as municipal and to make that definition retroactive.\u201d Id. at 251.\n\u00b632 The issue before the court in Lummi Indian Nation was whether the amendment violated the separation of powers doctrine when its retroactive application narrowed the applicability of our holding. Id. at 260. Writing again for a unanimous court, Justice Chambers concluded that the retroactive amendments did not offend the separation of powers doctrine. Id. at 262-63. He relied heavily on Hale. See id. at 261-63.\nIn Hale, we said that in order to decide whether the retroactive application of a statute violates separation of powers we must determine \u201cwhether the activity of one branch threatens the independence or integrity or invades the prerogatives of another.\u201d ... Retroactive legislation that interferes with vested rights established by judicial rulings interferes with a judicial function or results in manifest injustice or threatens the independence, integrity, or prerogatives of the judicial branch may violate separation of powers.\nHowever, in Hale, we also firmly rejected the contention that just because an appellate court\u2019s statutory interpretation relates back to the time the statute was originally adopted, any retroactive amendment of that statute violates separation of powers. Indeed, it is wholly within the sphere of authority of the legislative branch to make policy, to pass laws, and to amend laws already in effect.\nId. at 262 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 507). Applying these principles, the unanimous court found no separation of powers violation. Id. at 263. \u201cThe legislature made no attempt to apply the law to an existing set of facts, affect the rights of parties to the court\u2019s judgment, or interfere with any judicial function.\u201d Id. Its actions did not threaten the independence or integrity of the judiciary. Id.\n\u00b633 We apply the principles and reasoning announced in Hale to the facts before us and hold that the retroactive amendment does not offend the separation of powers doctrine. The sequence of events here is very similar to those in Hale. In Hale, the employer\u2019s alleged discriminatory conduct occurred in 2002-03. Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 499. In 2006, Hale filed suit against the employer. Id. On July 6,2006, we issued the McClarty decision, in which we interpreted \u201cdisability\u201d narrowly. See McClarty, 157 Wn.2d at 228. The trial judge granted partial summary judgment against Hale because Hale was not \u201cdisabled\u201d under the definition we adopted in McClarty. Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 499. The following month, the legislature rejected our interpretation of \u201cdisability,\u201d statutorily defined the term, and applied the amendment retroactively (except for cases occurring between the dates when McClarty was announced and the amendment was enacted). See id. at 500.\n\u00b634 Here, the estate of Hambleton objected to DOR\u2019s disallowing the QTIP deduction and petitioned for declaratory relief. After we issued Bracken, the trial court granted the estate summary judgment because there was no taxable transfer under our narrow interpretation of \u201ctransfer.\u201d The legislature then amended the definition to include QTIP transfers and applied the amendment retroactively. The sequence of events is identical to those in Hale.\n\u00b635 The court unequivocally allowed a retroactive amendment to change our interpretation of a statute in Hale. We will not overrule the rules announced in Hale and Lummi Indian Nation. Therefore, we hold the same today. The 2013 amendment does not offend the separation of powers doctrine. The legislature was careful to draft the law so that it \u201cdoes not affect any final judgment, no longer subject to appeal, entered by a court of competent jurisdiction before the effective date of this section [, June 14, 2013].\u201d Laws of 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 2, \u00a7 10. Like in Hale and Lummi Indian Nation, the legislature was threatening neither the independence nor the integrity of the court, nor was it invading the court\u2019s prerogative. See Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 510; Lummi Indian Nation, 170 Wn.2d at 263.\n\u00b636 It is additionally important to note that the legislature is not prohibited from passing amendments that directly impact cases pending in our court system. Wash. State Farm Bureau Fed\u2019n v. Gregoire, 162 Wn.2d 284, 304, 174 P.3d 1142 (2007) (\u201cNor is the legislature prohibited from \u2018passing] a law that directly impacts a case pending in Washington courts.\u2019 \u2018Litigation often brings to light latent ambiguities or unanswered questions that might not otherwise be apparent.\u2019 The legislature violates separation of powers principles by prescribing new rules to be applied to pending litigation only when doing so infringes on a judicial function by \u2018imped [ing] upon the court\u2019s right and duty to apply new law to the facts of this case,\u2019 \u2018dictat[ing] how the court should decide a factual issue,\u2019 or \u2018affect[ing] a final judgment.\u2019 \u201d (alterations in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Port of Seattle v. Pollution Control Hr\u2019gs Bd., 151 Wn.2d 568, 625-26, 90 P.3d 659 (2004); United States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822, 835 n.21, 104 S. Ct. 2769, 81 L. Ed. 2d 680 (1984))). When a legislature makes clear that an act is intended to apply retroactively, \u201can appellate court must apply that law in reviewing judgments still on appeal that were rendered before the law was enacted, and must alter the outcome accordingly.\u201d Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 226, 115 S. Ct. 1447, 131 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1995). In Plaut, the Court reasoned:\n[The judiciary is a] department composed of \u201cinferior Courts\u201d and \u201cone supreme Court.\u201d Within that hierarchy, the decision of an inferior court is not (unless the time for appeal has expired) the final word of the department as a whole. It is the obligation of the last court in the hierarchy that rules on the case to give effect to Congress\u2019s latest enactment, even when that has the effect of overturning the judgment of an inferior court, since each court at every level, must \u201cdecide according to existing laws.\u201d\nId. at 227 (quoting United States v. Schooner Peggy, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 103, 109, 2 L. Ed. 49 (1801)).\n\u00b637 The legislature did not violate the separation of powers doctrine when it passed the retroactive amendment to the Act.\nDue Process\n\u00b638 Applying a rational basis standard, the 2013 amendment\u2019s retroactive application does not violate due process of law. See United States v. Carlton, 512 U.S. 26, 30-31, 114 S. Ct. 2018, 129 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1994). The legislature has a legitimate purpose for the retroactive amendment, and the period of retroactivity is rationally related to that purpose. Id.\n\u00b639 States must not \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law____\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; Const, art. I, \u00a7 3. This constitutional protection guards against arbitrary and capricious government action. Amunrud, 158 Wn.2d at 219. Our analysis follows that of the federal constitution because the state constitution does not afford broader due process protection than the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See In re Pers. Restraint of Dyer, 143 Wn.2d 384, 394, 20 P.3d 907 (2001); State v. Morgan, 163 Wn. App. 341, 352, 261 P.3d 167 (2011). We use a rational basis standard for examining the 2013 amendment:\nThe due process standard to he applied to tax statutes with retroactive effect... is the same as that generally applicable to retroactive economic legislation:\n\u201cProvided that the retroactive application of a statute is supported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by rational means, judgments about the wisdom of such legislation remain within the exclusive province of the legislative and executive branches ....\n\u201cTo be sure,... retroactive legislation does have to meet a burden not faced by legislation that has only future effects____The retroactive aspects of legislation, as well as the prospective aspects, must meet the test of due process, and the justifications for the latter may not suffice for the former____But that burden is met simply by showing that the retroactive application of the legislation is itself justified by a rational legislative purpose.\u201d\nCarlton, 512 U.S. at 30-31 (emphasis added) (most alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. R.A. Gray & Co., 467 U.S. 717, 729-30, 104 S. Ct. 2709, 81 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1984)); see W.R. Grace & Co. v. Dep't of Revenue, 137 Wn.2d 580, 602-03, 973 P.2d 1011 (1999) (Our court applied the same standard when examining the retroactive application of a business and occupation tax.).\n\u00b640 Applying the rational basis standard, the Court in Carlton held that the retroactive application of revisions to the IRC did not violate the due process clause. Carlton, 512 U.S. at 28-29. As background, the IRC created a deduction for \u201chalf the proceeds of \u2018any sale of employer securities by the executor of an estate\u2019 to \u2018an employee stock ownership plan.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 28 (quoting former 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2057(b) (1982 ed. & Supp. IV)). In order to receive the deduction, the sale of securities had to take place before an estate filed its tax return. Id. The estate in Carlton bought and sold the securities for the purpose of taking advantage of the \u00a7 2057 deduction. Id. The transaction reduced the taxable estate by $2,501,161. Id. One week after the estate took advantage of the deduction, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that it would treat the deductions as available only to \u201cestates of decedents who owned the securities in question immediately before death.\u201d Id. at 29. Almost a year later, Congress amended the statute to conform to the IRS\u2019s policy. The amendment was to be applied retroactively, \u201cas if it had been contained in the statute as originally enacted\u201d a year prior. Id. The IRS disallowed the estate\u2019s deduction, and the estate in Carlton argued that this violated its due process rights. Id. The Court found no due process violation. Id. at 32-33.\n\u00b641 First, there was a legitimate purpose. Congress enacted the amendment to correct a mistake that \u201cwould have created a significant and unanticipated revenue loss.\u201d Id. at 32. This purpose was neither arbitrary nor illegitimate. Id. Second, the means were rationally related to the purpose. Id. at 32-33. The period of retroactivity extended slightly longer than one year. Id. at 33. The amendments were introduced in Congress shortly after the problem was discovered, and it took time to pass national legislation. See id. at 32-33. In reaching its conclusion in Carlton, the Court noted that it \u201crepeatedly has upheld retroactive tax legislation against a due process challenge.\u201d Id. at 30.\n\u00b642 Courts have upheld retroactive periods that are short and limited to that required by the practicalities of producing legislation and have upheld longer retroactive periods as well. See United States v. Darusmont, 449 U.S. 292, 297, 101 S. Ct. 549, 66 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1981); W.R. Grace, 137 Wn.2d at 586-87; Mont. Rail Link, Inc. v. United States, 76 F.3d 991, 993-94 (9th Cir. 1996); Enter. Leasing Co. of Phoenix v. Ariz. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 221 Ariz. 123, 125-29, 211 P.3d 1 (Ct. App. 2008). Our court found that a retroactive period spanning more than seven years did not violate the due process clause in W.R. Grace. 137 Wn.2d at 586-87.\n\u00b643 The facts in W.R. Grace involved the legislature\u2019s amending an unconstitutional business and occupation tax. The amendment limited taxpayer relief to a tax credit and applied retroactively. Id. at 586. A challenger sought relief from taxes it paid seven years before the amendment was enacted. See id. at 587. We found that there was a \u201crational legislative purpose\u201d and the \u201cretroactive application of the . . . remedial legislation [did] not offend constitutional principles.\u201d Id. at 603.\n\u00b644 Similarly, an amendment to the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, which applied retroactively for seven years, passed constitutional muster because it served a legitimate purpose (i.e., preventing a loss of government revenue and protecting employees who relied on receiving higher retirement benefits) and the period of retroactivity bore \u201ca rational relation to [the] underlying legislative purpose.\u201d Mont. Rail Link, Inc., 76 F.3d at 993-94. \u201cA shorter period of retroactivity would have been arbitrary and irrational.\u201d Id. at 994.\n\u00b645 Here, the retroactive application of the 2013 amendments meets the rational basis standard. See Carlton, 512 U.S. at 30-31. As stated in \u00a7 1 of the amendment, the purpose is to \u201crestore parity between married couples and unmarried individuals [by not allowing married individuals to avoid or greatly reduce their potential Washington estate tax liability], restore parity between QTIP property and other property eligible for the marital deduction, and prevent the adverse fiscal impacts of the Bracken decision . . . .\u201d Laws of 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 2, \u00a7 1(5). Like the legitimate purpose in Carlton, the purpose of the 2013 amendment is largely economic. Carlton, 512 U.S. at 32. According to the DOR fiscal note, the legislation was anticipated to\nincrease revenues to the education legacy trust account by an estimated $118.4 million in Fiscal Year 2014. The estimated revenue increase reflects the retroactive clarifications of the definitions of \u201ctransfer\u201d and \u201cWashington taxable estate\u201d to conform to the Department\u2019s interpretation, thereby eliminating any refund claims resulting from the recent court decision, other than for the Estate of Bracken. It also reflects other changes made to existing estate tax law.\nAgency Fiscal Note to Engrossed H.B. 2075, at 3, 63d Leg., 2d Spec. Sess. (Wash. 2013) (prepared by DOR). Preventing unanticipated and significant fiscal shortfall is a legitimate purpose for amending tax legislation. Carlton, 512 U.S. at 32.\n\u00b646 The period of retroactivity is also rationally related to preventing the fiscal shortfall. It provides the necessary funds, and the length of retroactivity is directly linked with the purpose of the amendment, which is to remedy the effects of Bracken. The amendment applies to all estates since our state enacted the Act. This period of retroactivity is not arbitrary. However, any period less than eight years would be arbitrary. It would allow some estates to escape the tax while similarly situated estates would be subject to it. Additionally, the eight-year period of retroactivity is not far outside other retroactive periods that courts have accepted. See W.R. Grace, 137 Wn.2d at 586-87; Mont. Rail Link, Inc., 76 F.3d at 993-94; Enter. Leasing Co., 221 Ariz. 123. Therefore, the retroactive period meets the due process clause\u2019s rational basis test.\n\u00b647 The Estates make two failing arguments regarding the due process clause. First, the Estates argue that the 2013 amendments impose a wholly new tax, making the Carlton standard inapplicable. The Ninth Circuit rejected this argument in Quarty v. United States, 170 F.3d 961, 966-67 (9th Cir. 1999). The parties were attempting avoid the application of Carlton and, instead, invoke precedent from the 1920s. Id. at 966. The 1920s cases considered retroactive application of the first gift tax, which violated due process. Id. The Ninth Circuit quoted Carlton:\n\u201cThose cases were decided during an era characterized by exacting review of economic legislation under an approach that \u2018has long since been discarded.\u2019 To the extent that their authority survives, they do not control here. Blodgett and Untermyer, which involved the Nation\u2019s first gift tax, essentially have been limited to situations involving \u2018the creation of a wholly new tax,\u2019 and their \u2018authority is of limited value in assessing the constitutionality of subsequent amendments that bring about certain changes in the operation of the tax laws.\u2019 \u201d\nId. at 966-67 (citations omitted) (citing Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 48 S. Ct. 105, 72 L. Ed. 206 (1927); Untermeyer v. Anderson, 276 U.S. 440, 48 S. Ct. 353, 72 L Ed. 645 (1928) and quoting Carlton, 512 U.S. at 34 (quoting Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 730, 83 S. Ct. 1028, 10 L. Ed. 2d 93 (1963); United States v. Hemme, 476 U.S. 558, 568, 106 S. Ct. 2071, 90 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986))). The court concluded, \u201c[A] new tax is imposed only when the taxpayer has \u2018no reason to suppose that any transactions of the sort will be taxed at all.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 967 (quoting Darusmont, 449 U.S. at 298, 300).\n\u00b648 The 2013 amendments did not create a wholly new tax. Washington has long received revenue from estate taxes, and the taxpayers had \u201creason to suppose\u201d that the state would tax shifting interests in assets upon death. See id. Therefore, Carlton's, rational basis test applies. See id.\n\u00b649 The Estates\u2019 second unsuccessful argument is that applying the amendments retroactively is unconstitutional because it impairs a vested right acquired under existing law. Appellant\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 27 (\u201cthe existing law here being, in effect, no estate tax at all, or rather the \u2018pickup\u2019 tax Washington instituted in 1981\u201d). \u201cA statute may not be applied retroactively to infringe a vested right.\u201d In re Pers. Restraint of Carrier, 173 Wn.2d 791, 810, 272 P.3d 209 (2012). We recently stated:\nThis notion finds root in the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. While due process generally does not prevent new laws from going into effect, it does prohibit changes to the law that retroactively affect rights which vested under the prior law. We have said that\n[a] vested right, entitled to protection from legislation, must be something more than a mere expectation based upon an anticipated continuance of the existing law; it must have become a title, legal or equitable, to the present or future enjoyment of property, a demand, or a legal exemption from a demand by another.\nId. at 811 (alteration in original) (citations omitted) (quoting Godfrey v. State, 84 Wn.2d 959, 963, 530 P.2d 630 (1975)). For example, we declined to apply an amendment retroactively when the legislature was silent as to retroactivity and a party had a vested interest. In re F.D. Processing, Inc., 119 Wn.2d 452, 460, 463, 832 P.2d 1303 (1992).\n\u00b650 Here, DOR correctly notes that the Estates do not explain what vested right the remainder beneficiaries held in the QTIP that was impacted by the amendment. The remaindermen had vested rights in the trust property upon the death of the first spouse. This interest became a vested present interest upon the death of the surviving spouse, and the legislature is taxing the shift in interest. The estate tax does not deprive the remaindermen of their interest in the property or change the nature of their interest. It simply taxes the transfer of assets.\n\u00b651 On a related note, in Carlton, the Supreme Court stated,\nTax legislation is not a promise, and a tax payer has no vested right in the Internal Revenue Code. Justice Stone explained in Welch v. Henry, 305 U.S. [134, 146-47, 59 S. Ct. 121, 83 L. Ed. 87 (1938)]:\n\u201cTaxation is neither a penalty imposed on the taxpayer nor a liability which he assumes by contract. It is but a way of apportioning the cost of government among those who in some measure are privileged to enjoy its benefits and must bear its burdens. Since no citizen enjoys immunity from that burden, its retroactive imposition does not necessarily infringe due process ...\u201d\nCarlton, 512 U.S. at 33 (second alteration in original). Similarly, the Estates here do not have a vested right in Washington\u2019s pre-2005 pickup tax scheme.\n\u00b652 There is no due process violation because the 2013 amendments serve a legitimate purpose and the period of retroactivity is rationally related to that purpose.\nImpairment of Contract\n|53 The 2013 amendments do not violate the impairment of contracts clause because the amendments are not a substantial impairment to a contract and the legislative amendment was reasonably necessary.\n\u00b654 Both the federal constitution and Washington State Constitution protect citizens from state laws that impair the obligation of contracts. Const, art. I, \u00a7 23; U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1; see Wash. Fed\u2019n of State Emps. v. State, 101 Wn.2d 536, 539, 682 P.2d 869 (1984) (\u201c[Const, art. I, \u00a7 23] is substantially the same as U.S. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 10 and is to be given the same effect.\u201d). Like many other constitutional rights, the clause\u2019s protections are not absolute; \u201cits prohibition must be accommodated to the inherent police power of the State \u2018to safeguard the vital interests of its people.\u2019 \u201d Energy Reserves Grp., Inc. v. Kan. Power & Light Co., 459 U.S. 400, 410, 103 S. Ct. 697, 74 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1983) (quoting Home Bldg. & Loan Ass\u2019n v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 434, 54 S. Ct. 231, 78 L. Ed. 413 (1934)).\n\u00b655 As a threshold matter, we inquire into \u201c \u2018whether the state law has, in fact, operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 411 (quoting Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U.S. 234, 244, 98 S. Ct. 2716, 57 L. Ed. 2d 727 (1978)). \u201cThe impaired relationship must be a \u2018contract\u2019 in the usual sense of the word \u2018signifying an agreement of two or more minds, upon sufficient consideration, to do or not to do certain acts.\u2019 \u201d Haberman, 109 Wn.2d at 145 (quoting Crane v. Hahlo, 258 U.S. 142, 146, 42 S. Ct. 214, 66 L. Ed. 514 (1922)). However, in 1931, the United States Supreme Court applied the contracts clause to a trust deed. Coolidge v. Long, 282 U.S. 582, 595, 51 S. Ct. 306, 75 L. Ed. 562 (1931). \u201cA contract is impaired by a statute which alters its terms, imposes new conditions or lessens its value.\u201d Caritas Servs., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. & Health Servs., 123 Wn.2d 391, 404, 869 P.2d 28 (1994). We look for a substantial impairment. Margola Assocs. v. City of Seattle, 121 Wn.2d 625, 653, 854 P.2d 23 (1993). An impairment may be substantial if a party relied on the supplanted clause. Caritas, 123 Wn.2d at 405. However, \u201ca party who enters into a contract regarding an activity \u2018already regulated in the particular [way] to which he now objects\u2019 is deemed to have contracted \u2018subject to further legislation upon the same topic\u2019.\u201d Margola Assocs., 121 Wn.2d at 653 (quoting Veix v. Sixth Ward Bldg. & Loan Ass\u2019n, 310 U.S. 32, 38, 60 S. Ct. 792, 84 L. Ed. 1061 (1940)).\n\u00b656 If the threshold is met and the contract is between private parties, we determine whether the enactment was reasonably necessary. Carlstrom v. State, 103 Wn.2d 391, 394, 694 P.2d 1 (1985). \u201cThe contracts clause does not prohibit the states from repealing or amending statutes generally, or from enacting legislation with retroactive effects.\u201d Haberman, 109 Wn.2d at 145.\n\u00b657 Here, the threshold inquiry is not met and the amendments were reasonably necessary. There was no substantial impairment of the trust because it was reasonable for the Estates to expect that the estate tax law would change. See Coolidge, 282 U.S. at 595. Additionally, the 2013 amendments meet the \u201creasonably necessary\u201d standard for contracts where the State is not a party. The purpose of the amendments is to provide revenue to fund education. See Laws of 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 2, \u00a7 1(1). \u201c \u2018[T]he State . . . has an affirmative paramount duty to make ample provision for funding the \u201cbasic education\u201d ....\u2019\u201d McCleary v. State, 173 Wn.2d 477, 517, 269 P.3d 227 (2012) (second alteration in original) (quoting Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. State, 90 Wn.2d 476, 520, 585 P.2d 71 (1978)). Imposing a tax on the Estates prevented the fiscal shortfall created by Bracken. Therefore, the 2013 amendments do not unconstitutionally impair contracts.\nArticle VII, Section 1\n\u00b658 We hold that the amendments do not violate article VII, section 1 of the Washington State Constitution. Article VII, section 1 of the Washington Constitution provides, \u201cAll taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of property within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax and shall be levied and collected for public purposes only.\u201d This uniformity requirement applies only to property tax and not excise tax. Dean, 143 Wn.2d at 25-26 (\u201cExcise taxes also fall beyond the breadth of the uniformity requirement.\u201d). Because the estate tax is an excise tax, the 2013 amendments do not violate article VII, section 1.\nf 59 A tax is an \u201cexcise\u201d or \u201ctransfer\u201d tax if the government is taxing \u201ca particular use or enjoyment of property or the shifting from one to another of any power or privilege incidental to the ownership or enjoyment of property.\u201d Fernandez, 326 U.S. at 352. An estate tax is an excise tax because the tax is \u201cnot levied on the property of which an estate is composed. Rather it is imposed upon the shifting of economic benefits and the privilege of transmitting or receiving such benefits.\u201d West, 334 U.S. at 727.\n\u00b660 Transfers are broadly construed at death under federal estate tax law \u2014 the system on which the Act is based. For example, the United States Supreme Court stated:\n[T]he [federal] estate tax as originally devised and constitutionally supported was a tax upon transfers. But the power of Congress to impose death taxes is not limited to the taxation of transfers at death. It extends to the creation, exercise, acquisition, or relinquishment of any power or legal privilege which is incident to the ownership of property, and when any of these is occasioned by death, it may as readily be the subject of the federal tax as the transfer of the property at death.\nFernandez, 326 U.S. at 352 (citations omitted). The First Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that the estate tax is not \u201cin a strict sense a tax upon a \u2018transfer\u2019 of the property by the death of the decedent. It is an excise tax upon the happening of an event, namely, death, where the death brings about certain described changes in legal relationships affecting property.\u201d Chickering v. Comm\u2019r, 118 F.2d 254, 257-58 (1st Cir. 1941).\n\u00b661 Following these general principles, taxing QTIP assets upon the death of a surviving spouse qualifies as an excise tax. The surviving spouse had the economic benefit of using the income from QTIP assets during his or her life. And, upon the surviving spouse\u2019s death, the remainder beneficiaries of the trust gained a present interest in the assets and income. The death of the surviving spouse brought about \u201cchanges in legal relationships affecting property.\u201d Id. Therefore, the Estate and Transfer Tax Act is an excise tax and not subject to article VII, section 1.\nEquitable & Collateral Estoppel\n\u00b662 DOR is not equitably estopped from applying the 2013 amendments to the estate of Macbride. The elements of equitable estoppel are:\n(1) a party\u2019s admission, statement or act inconsistent with, its later claim; (2) action by another party in reliance on the first party\u2019s act, statement or admission; and (3) injury that would result to the relying party from allowing the first party to contradict or repudiate the prior act, statement or admission.\nKramarevcky v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. & Health Servs., 122 Wn.2d 738, 743, 863 P.2d 535 (1993). Assertions of equitable estoppel against the government are not favored; parties must demonstrate that equitable estoppel is necessary to prevent a manifest injustice and that the exercise of governmental functions will not be impaired as a result of the estoppel. Id. Generally, we \u201cshould be most reluctant to find the government equitably estopped when public revenues are involved.\u201d Id. at 744.\n\u00b663 The estate of Macbride bases its estoppel argument on the fact that had it transferred its appeal to our court alongside Bracken, the 2013 amendment would not apply to it. However, the estate fails to prove the second element with clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, in that the estate failed to prove reliance on DOR\u2019s statements. See City of Seattle v. St. John, 166 Wn.2d 941, 948-49, 215 P.3d 194 (2009).\n\u00b664 DOR moved to stay proceedings pending our decision in Bracken. It reasoned that the current case and Bracken involved the same legal issues and that our decision in Bracken would likely resolve the estate of Mac-bride\u2019s appeal and make any further proceedings moot. Even if the motion is a statement or assertion, the estate did not rely on it. Instead, the estate filed a response that opposed DOR\u2019s motion to stay. Given these facts, equitable estoppel does not apply.\n\u00b665 Additionally, collateral estoppel does not prevent DOR from relitigating issues. Before a court will invoke collateral estoppel,\nthe party asserting the doctrine must prove: (1) the issue decided in the prior adjudication is identical with the one presented in the second action; (2) the prior adjudication must have ended in a final judgment on the merits; (3) the party against whom the plea is asserted was a party or in privity with the party to the prior adjudication; and (4) application of the doctrine does not work an injustice.\nNielson v. Spanaway Gen. Med. Clinic, Inc., 135 Wn.2d 255, 262-63, 956 P.2d 312 (1998). However, an issue may not be precluded if \u201ca new determination is warranted in order to take account of an intervening change in the applicable legal context or otherwise to avoid inequitable administration of the laws.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 28(2)(b) (Am. Law Inst. 1982). Here, the applicable law has been amended. Therefore, review is warranted to take account of this change. See id.\nStatute of Limitations\n\u00b666 The statute of limitations does not prevent the 2013 amendments from applying to the estate of Hambleton. Under RCW 83.100.095(3), \u201c[n]o assessment or correction of an assessment for additional taxes ... may be made by the department more than four years after the close of the calendar year in which a Washington return is due . . . .\u201d DOR issued its assessment of taxes due on November 18, 2008, only two years after Helen Hambleton passed away. In the assessment, the amount owing was \u201cattributable to the [e] state\u2019s exclusion of ... \u2018\u00a7 2044 property\u2019 from the Washington taxable estate.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 17-18. The estate filed its Washington State estate tax return on January 11, 2008. Therefore, DOR issued its assessment well within the four year statute of limitations. See RCW 83.100.095(3). The estate offers no support as to why a new or corrected assessment is needed. The assessment has always included QTIP trust property. The estate has had notice of the amount due since 2008. Therefore, the 2013 amendments are not barred by the statute of limitations. See RCW 83.100.095(3).\nFinal Judgment\n\u00b667 The estate of Hambleton argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling was final at the time the legislature enacted the 2013 amendment, so the amendment should not apply to it. See Laws of 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 2, \u00a7 10 (\u201c[The] act does not affect any final judgment, no longer subject to appeal, entered by a court of competent jurisdiction before the effective date of this section\u201d). We disagree. The estate arrives at this conclusion by arguing that DOR had no basis in law on which to appeal the order granting summary judgment because DOR appealed the order before the amendments were enacted. This reasoning is unpersuasive.\n\u00b6[68 Generally, \u201c[w]hen a new law makes clear that it is retroactive, an appellate court must apply that law in reviewing judgments still on appeal that were rendered before the law was enacted, and must alter the outcome accordingly.\u201d Plaut, 514 U.S. at 226. Therefore, despite the existence of a \u201cfinal\u201d trial court ruling, retroactive amendments may apply to cases pending on appeal.\nf 69 A party may appeal final trial court judgments. RAP 2.2(a)(1). However, parties may not frivolously appeal or appeal simply for purposes of delay. RAP 18.9(c). Appellate courts will, on motion from the opposing party, dismiss frivolous appeals and appeals brought for purposes of delay. RAP 18.9(c).\n\u00b670 Here, the trial court entered its order granting summary judgment on April 19, 2013 and DOR filed a notice of appeal on May 16, 2013. The estate of Hambleton did not move under RAP 18.9(c) to dismiss the appeal, and the appeal was still pending when the legislature enacted the 2013 amendment. Therefore, the retroactive amendment applies to the case.\nConclusion\n171 No barriers prohibit the retroactive application of the 2013 amendment to the Estates of Hambleton and Macbride. No genuine issues of material fact exist in the cases, and judgment may be entered as a matter of law.\n\u00b672 We reverse the order granting summary judgment to the estate of Hambleton and remand for the entry of judgment in accordance with this opinion. We affirm the denial of summary judgment to the estate of Macbride and affirm the order affirming agency action and granting judgment as a matter of law to DOR.\nMadsen, C.J.; C. Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Gordon McCloud, JJ.; and Dwyer, J. Pro Tem., concur.\nReconsideration denied January 9, 2015.\nFor the sake of clarity, we refer to the spouses by their first names. We intend no disrespect.\nThe sequence of events is slightly different in Macbride, but this does not change our analysis. The trial court granted DOR summary judgment well before the Bracken opinion was filed. The case was pending before the Court of Appeals when Bracken became law. And, the case was still pending when the legislature enacted the 2013 amendments. As in Hale, this case was pending before the courts when a decision by our court was released. The legislature retroactively changed the law. And, we apply the change in law to cases pending in the courts.\nThe Estates are really arguing this appeal as a matter of fairness. None of their constitutional arguments dictate that they get the relief they seek. The decision to retroactively amend the statute was a policy decision, properly in the sphere of the legislature.\nThe Estates\u2019 briefs suggest that Carlton creates a threshold on the period of retroactivity. Our court has allowed periods of retroactivity extending beyond one year, as have other jurisdictions. W.R. Grace, 137 Wn.2d at 586-87; Mont. Rail Link, Inc., 76 F.3d at 993-94; Enter. Leasing Co., 221 Ariz. at 127 (\u201cWe do not interpret our precedents as creating a talismanic cutoff of one year.\u201d).\nNeither of the Estates raises the issue of judicial estoppel. \u201c \u2018Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that precludes a party from asserting one position in a court proceeding and later seeking an advantage by taking a clearly inconsistent position.\u2019 \u201d Anfinson v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc., 174 Wn.2d 851, 861, 281 P.3d 289 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Arkison v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 160 Wn.2d 535, 538, 160 P.3d 13 (2007)). Three factors guide judicial estoppel: \u201c(1) whether \u2018a party\u2019s later position\u2019 is \u2018clearly inconsistent with its earlier position\u2019; (2) whether \u2018judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled\u2019; and (3) \u2018whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.\u2019 \u201d Arkison, 160 Wn.2d at 538-39 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 750-51, 121 S. Ct. 1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001)). Judicial estoppel is not applicable. The parties have not taken inconsistent positions, nor have they misled the court. It was the legislature that changed the law that applies to the cases.",

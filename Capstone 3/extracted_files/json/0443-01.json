        "text": "Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\n\u00b6 1 The Barclay Court Owners Association amended its condominium declaration to restrict the number of units that could be leased at one time. After this amendment was passed and recorded, Carolyn Bilanko purchased a condo at Barclay Court. Four years later, Bilanko challenged the amendment as improperly passed. We must decide whether Bilanko\u2019s challenge is timely under the Washington Condominium Act (WCA), chapter 64.34 RCW. We hold that it is not timely and reverse.\nBackground\n\u00b62 Barclay Court is a condominium owners\u2019 association for a 28-unit residential condominium development in Seattle, Washington. Barclay Court was organized under the WCA, chapter 64.34 RCW, and recorded its residential condominium declaration (Declaration) on May 2, 2001. Section 9.2 of the 2001 Declaration stated that there was \u201cno restriction on the right of any [o]wner to lease or otherwise rent its [u]nit.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 111.\n\u00b63 Seven years later, Barclay Court amended its Declaration to limit leasing with the stated intent of \u201cpreserving and enhancing the value of the Condominium and of the individual units.\u201d Id. at 204,206. This amendment, \u201cAmendment No. 1,\u201d provided that only seven units could be leased at any time. Under the Declaration, the \u201cimposition of any restrictions on leasing of [u]nits\u201d required only a 67 percent vote to pass. Id. at 194. However, any changes to the \u201cuses to which any [u]nit is restricted\u201d required a 90 percent vote to pass. Id. at 194. The Declaration does not define the term \u201cuse,\u201d and it is not immediately apparent which vote total was needed to approve the amendment. We do know that the amendment received at least 67 percent of the vote on October 27, 2008. The association treated the amendment as effective. It was properly recorded on November 3, 2008.\n\u00b64 A year later, Bilanko purchased a two-bedroom unit in Barclay Court. Her recorded statutory warranty deed indicated the property was subject to Barclay Court\u2019s Declaration and Amendment No. 1. At some point, Bilanko decided she wanted to lease her unit. Unfortunately, seven units were already being leased at the time. In March 2013, Bilanko asked to be put on the leasing waiting list. She was number five on the waiting list. In September 2013, Bilanko requested a hardship waiver under section 9.2.6.5 of the amendment to allow her to lease her unit. Barclay Court denied Bilanko\u2019s request. Bilanko persisted. She notified Barclay Court in October 2013 that she intended to lease her unit beginning in November and would sue unless Barclay Court revised Amendment No. 1. Counsel for Barclay Court responded that Bilanko would violate the Declaration if she leased out her unit and that Barclay Court had the right to evict any unauthorized tenants.\n\u00b65 Bilanko sued Barclay Court on July 14,2014, alleging that the leasing amendment was invalid because it had not received sufficient votes to change the \u201cuses to which any [u]nit is restricted\u201d under RCW 64.34.264 and the Declaration. CP at 1-7. Barclay Court moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that Bilanko\u2019s action was barred by the one-year statute of limitations under RCW 64.34.264(2) and an identical one-year limit in the Declaration. Bilanko moved for declaratory relief, arguing that the amendment was not correctly adopted, that it was void ab initio, and that her challenge was not barred by the statute of limitations. The trial court judge initially granted Barclay Court\u2019s motion and denied Bilanko\u2019s. It found that although Bilanko would have prevailed on the merits had she filed a timely challenge, the statute of limitations under RCW 64.34.264(2) barred her claim. Shortly afterward, the trial judge stayed its order and certified the case for interlocutory review under RAP 2.3(b)(4).\n\u00b66 Meanwhile, Division Three of the Court of Appeals held that a challenge to an amendment that was not properly passed under the WCA is not barred by the one-year limitation in RCW 64.34.264(2). Club Envy of Spokane, LLC v. Ridpath Tower Condo. Ass\u2019n, 184 Wn. App. 593, 601, 337 P.3d 1131 (2014). After the Club Envy decision, Bilanko moved the trial court to vacate its previous orders and enter judgment for her. Based on Club Envy, the trial court granted her motion, declared Barclay Court\u2019s amendment invalid, and entered summary judgment for Bilanko. The parties stipulated to dismissal of the remaining claims without prejudice under CR 41(a)(1)(A) to facilitate review.\n\u00b67 Barclay Court timely sought direct review in this court under RAP 4.2(a)(4) as a fundamental and urgent issue of broad public importance. We granted review.\nAnalysis\n\u00b68 Barclay Court argues that Bilanko\u2019s challenge to Amendment No. 1 is time barred under RCW 64.34.264(2). We agree. Under a plain reading of the statute, a challenge to an allegedly invalid amendment cannot be brought more than one year after the amendment is recorded. Unlike in Club Envy, equity does not demand the time limit for this challenge be tolled.\n\u00b69 Whether a claim is time barred is a legal question we review de novo. Goodman v. Goodman, 128 Wn.2d 366, 373, 907 P.2d 290 (1995). RCW 64.34.264(2) provides that \u201c[n]o action to challenge the validity of an amendment adopted by the association pursuant to this section may be brought more than one year after the amendment is recorded.\u201d Section 25.1 of the Declaration contains nearly identical language as the WCA, barring challenges more than one year after the recording of an amendment.\n\u00b610 The plain language of RCW 64.34.264(2) bars challenges to the validity of an amendment brought more than one year after recording the amendment. Since the statute does not define \u201cvalidity,\u201d we look to a dictionary to determine its ordinary meaning. State v. Gonzalez, 168 Wn.2d 256, 263, 226 P.3d 131 (2010) (citing Estate of Haselwood v. Bremerton Ice Arena, Inc., 166 Wn.2d 489, 498, 210 P.3d 308 (2009)). \u201cValid\u201d is defined as \u201cIllegally sufficient; binding.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1784 (10th ed. 2009). This time bar, then, is intended to prevent challenges to whether an amendment is legally sufficient or binding that are brought more than a year after recording the amendment.\n\u00b611 Here, Bilanko is challenging the legal sufficiency of the amendment. She argues that the amendment is \u201cinvalid because it did not receive the level of owner approval required under the WCA.\u201d Resp\u2019t Bilanko\u2019s Appellate Br. at 10 (boldface omitted). Under RCW 64.34.264(2), Bilanko had one year from November 3,2008, when Barclay Court recorded the amendment, to bring her challenge. Bilanko did not challenge the validity of the amendment until 2014. Bilanko\u2019s challenge is time barred under the plain language of RCW 64.34.264(2).\n\u00b612 Relying on Club Envy, Bilanko argues that the time bar applies only to amendments that were passed \u201cpursuant to,\u201d or \u201cin compliance with,\u201d the requirements of RCW 64.34.264. Resp\u2019t Bilanko\u2019s Appellate Br. at 31 (citing Club Envy, 184 Wn. App. at 593). Adopting her approach would require us to consider the merits of a challenge before determining whether the time bar applies\u2014an approach we are reluctant to adopt in this case. In contrast, it is easy to see why the court took that approach in Club Envy. There, the unit owners alleged the condo association president, who had been convicted of fraud in unrelated cases at the time of summary judgment, had fraudulently filed amendments decreasing the allocated interests of each unit owner. Club Envy, 184 Wn. App. at 597-98. Nothing in the opinion suggests that any vote was held, and the unit owners were not aware of the amendment until after the amendment was recorded. Id. at 602. While not specifically reaching (but hinting strongly) whether in fact the amendments had been fraudulently filed, the Court of Appeals held that a challenge to the \u201cvalidity of the amendment as not being properly passed by the association pursuant to the WCA is not barred by RCW 64.34.264(2)\u2019s one-year limitation.\u201d Id. at 601.\n\u00b613 Club Envy dealt with a strikingly different issue than what is present in this case. There, it appears the condo association president committed fraud by recording an amendment that he did not have the legal authority to record without the consent of any of the other unit owners. The court concluded the amendment was void ab initio, or \u201cvoid from its inception.\u201d Club Envy, 184 Wn. App. at 600-01. Actions that exceed the decision-maker\u2019s authority are generally void. See, e.g., S. Tacoma Way, LLC v. State, 169 Wn.2d 118, 123, 233 P.3d 871 (2010) (indicating that a government contract is void only where the government entity \u201chad no authority to enter the contract in the first place\u201d); see In re Pers. Restraint of Thompson, 141 Wn.2d 712, 719-23, 10 P.3d 380 (2000) (holding judgment and sentence invalid where court had no authority to convict defendant of a nonexistent crime); cf. In re Disciplinaiy Proceeding Against Hammermaster, 139 Wn.2d 211, 219, 985 P.2d 924 (1999) (discussing municipal judge\u2019s lack of authority to impose unauthorized sentences). These types of challenges can generally be made outside of a statutory time bar. Club Envy, 184 Wn. App. at 601; accord S. Tacoma Way, 169 Wn.2d at 124 (\u201cIf the transaction was truly void, as our cases recognize, it would be subject to challenge and invalidation at any time, perhaps years later.\u201d); see also Allstate Ins. Co. v. Khani, 75 Wn. App. 317, 323-24, 877 P.2d 724 (1994) (\u201cVoid judgments may be vacated regardless of the lapse of time.\u201d (citing In re Marriage of Leslie, 112 Wn.2d 612, 618-19, 772 P.2d 1013 (1989))).\n\u00b614 In essence, Bilanko asks us to hold that any legal error committed by a condominium association that changes a declaration renders the change void and challenges exempt from the WCA time bar. It is true that condominium associations are organized as corporations, and corporations must act in accordance with any formalities \u201cprescribed by its charter, or by the general law.\u201d Twisp Mining & Smelting Co. v. Chelan Mining Co., 16 Wn.2d 264, 294, 133 P.2d 300 (1943); RCW 64.34.300. It is also true that when a corporation acts beyond its corporate powers or its actions offend public policy, those actions are void. Twisp, 16 Wn.2d at 293-94. But if a corporation fails to observe some statutory requirement while acting within its corporate powers, the act is \u201cvoidable only, and is valid until avoided, not void until validated.\u201d Id. at 294 (quoting 19 C.J.S. Corporations \u00a7 968 (1940)). Actions that fail to comply with statutory requirements are generally not void unless the legislature has authorized such a penalty. See Way v. Pac. Lumber & Timber Co., 74 Wash. 332, 333, 133 P. 595 (1913) (articulating rule that \u201ca contract which violates a statutory regulation of business is not void unless made so by the terms of the act\u201d); see also Yakima Lodge No. 53 v. Schneider, 173 Wash. 639, 642-43, 24 P.2d 103 (1933) (\u201cThe ordinance did not provide that contracts made in violation thereof should be void.\u201d); accord Allison v. Medicab Int'l, Inc., 92 Wn.2d 199, 203, 597 P.2d 380 (1979) (noting failure to comply with statutory requirements to register franchise did not render franchise agreement void).\n\u00b615 In this case, however, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Barclay Court committed fraud, seriously offended public policy, or exceeded its legal authority in passing the amendment. Accordingly, the amendment is not void ab initio. Barclay Court followed the procedures set out in article 25 of its Declaration: a majority of the board of directors voted to submit the amendment for owner approval, all owners were notified of the proposed amendment in writing, and at least 67 percent of the owners approved the amendment. Barclay Court acted within the statutory authority it has under RCW 64.34.264(5) to prepare, execute, record, and certify the amendment. Nothing in RCW 64.34.264 suggests that the legislature intended to make amendments not passed with the required supermajority void and subject to challenge at any time. It strains credulity to believe that it would not make such a draconian consequence explicit in the statute.\n\u00b616 We need not decide what vote threshold was necessary to enact Amendment No. 1. Regardless of the percent required to pass the amendment, it was, at most, voidable. Challenges to voidable amendments must be made within the one-year time bar set out in RCW 64.34.264(2). To hold otherwise would render the time bar meaningless, for unit owners could challenge amendments years after passage. A statutory time bar is a \u201c \u2018legislative declaration of public policy which the courts can do no less than respect,\u2019 \u201d with rare equitable exceptions. Cost Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. City of Lakewood, 178 Wn.2d 635, 651, 310 P.3d 804 (2013) (quoting J.M. Arthur & Co. v. Burke, 83 Wn. 690, 693, 145 P. 974 (1915)); Millay v. Cam, 135 Wn.2d 193, 206, 955 P.2d 791 (1998) (discussing predicates for equitable tolling of statutory time limits).\n\u00b617 Unlike in Club Envy, where it appears the amendments were fraudulently filed, no grounds for equitable tolling appear here. Bilanko purchased her condo with Barclay Court over a year after the amendment had been voted on by the unit owners, passed, and recorded. She was on constructive, if not actual, notice at the time of purchase that her condo unit was subject to a leasing restriction. Bilanko did not have to purchase a condo subject to a leasing restriction. As the Declaration does not impose any restraints on alienation, Bilanko is free to sell her unit at any time.\n\u00b618 Accordingly, we hold that Bilanko\u2019s challenge to the amendment is time barred under RCW 64.34.264(2).\nConclusion\n\u00b619 We hold that Bilanko\u2019s challenge to the declaration amendment is barred by the one-year limitation under RCW 64.34.264(2). We reverse the trial court\u2019s summary judgment ruling in favor of Bilanko and remand the case back to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gordon McCloud, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nReconsideration denied July 21, 2016.\nThe Washington Condominium Act governs condominium complexes created after July 1, 1990. Filmore LLLP v. Unit Owners Ass\u2019n of Centre Pointe Condo., 184 Wn.2d 170, 171-72, 355 P.3d 1128 (2015) (citing Shorewood W. Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Sadri, 140 Wn.2d 47, 52, 992 P.2d 1008 (2000)).\nSection 5.5 of the Declaration indicates voting is allocated equally to each unit, with each unit entitled to one vote.\nWe are aware of the recurring, unsettled question of whether the definition of \u201cuse\u201d in the WCA includes the leasing or renting of a unit. The legislature may well wish to clarify the WCA on this point.\nWhile the exact vote count is not in the record before us, the amendment, as signed by the president of Barclay Court, states it passed with at least 67 percent of the vote.\nThe parties dispute whether this time bar operates as a statute of limitations or a statute of repose. A statute of limitation bars a plaintiff from bringing an already accrued claim after a specific period of time has passed; a statute of repose, however, terminates a right of action after a specified time, even if an injury has not yet occurred. 1000 Va. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Vertecs Corp., 158 Wn.2d 566, 574-75, 146 P.3d 423 (2006) (quoting Rice v. Dow Chem. Co., 124 Wn.2d 205, 211-12, 875 P.2d 1213 (1994)). We need not decide between the two as the result is the same in this case.\nAn agreement or contract is \u201cvoid ab initio\u2019\u2019 if it \u201cseriously offends law or public policy, in contrast to a contract that is merely voidable at the election of one party to the contract.\u2019\u2019 Black\u2019s, supra, 1805.\nWashington Practice is instructive on this point: \u201cObviously the purchaser of a condominium unit should review in detail the existing use restrictions .... The investigation is an important one for the purchaser, but it is mainly a practical and personal, and not a legal, problem.\u2019\u2019 18 William B. Stoebuck & John W. Weaver, Washington Practice: Real Estate \u00a7 12.10, at 53 (2d ed. 2004).\nRCW 64.34.455 grants courts the discretion to award attorney fees to the \u201cprevailing party.\u2019\u2019 Barclay Court is the prevailing party, and we therefore award them reasonable attorney fees under RAP 18.1.",

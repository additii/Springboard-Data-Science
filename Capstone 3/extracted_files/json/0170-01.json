        "text": "Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\n\u00b61 We are asked whether amending a particular condominium declaration to provide that only a certain percentage of condominium units may be leased is an amendment that changes \u201cthe uses to which any unit is restricted,\u201d which requires special supermajority approval under RCW 64.34.264(4) and the declaration. We find that the amendment does change \u201cthe uses to which any unit is restricted\u201d under this particular declaration because the declaration provides that leasing is a use, and, therefore, special supermajority approval was required for the amendment. Because the amendment did not receive the required special supermajority approval, we find that the amendment is not valid and affirm the courts below.\nFacts\n\u00b62 Centre Pointe Condominium is a residential condominium complex in Bellingham, Washington. The Unit Owners Association of Centre Pointe Condominium (Centre Pointe) was formed in May 2003 by a declaration of condominium (Declaration) recorded in Whatcom County.\n\u00b63 The Washington Condominium Act (WCA), chapter 64.34 RCW, governs condominium complexes created after July 1, 1990. Shorewood W. Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Sadri, 140 Wn.2d 47, 49, 52, 992 P.2d 1008 (2000) (citing RCW 64.34-.010). Under RCW 64.34.264(1), a condominium declaration may be amended by the vote or agreement of owners to which at least 67 percent of the votes are allocated. RCW 64.34.264(4), however, provides an exception to that general rule, requiring the vote or agreement of the owner of each unit particularly affected and the owners of units to which at least 90 percent of the votes are allocated for an amendment that \u201cmay create or increase special declarant rights, increase the number of units, change the boundaries of any unit, the allocated interests of a unit, or the uses to which any unit is restricted .\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\u00b64 The Declaration mirrors the WCA scheme and language. Section 17.1 of the Declaration provides that a 67 percent vote is generally sufficient to amend the Declaration, in line with RCW 64.34.264(1). Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 68. Section 17.3 mirrors RCW 64.34.264(4), requiring \u201cthe vote or agreement of the Owner of each Unit particularly affected and his or her Mortgagee and the Owners of Units to which at least ninety percent (90%) of the votes in the Association are allocated\u201d for certain changes, including any change to \u201cthe uses to which any Unit is restricted.\u201d Id. at 69. Although RCW 64.34.264(1) and (4) establish the minimum voting percentage required for certain declaration amendments, the declaration itself can provide for higher percentages. See RCW 64.34.264(1).\n\u00b65 A clubhouse and three residential buildings with 97 units of the Centre Pointe complex were built prior to 2011. In May 2011, Filmore LLLP bought an unfinished portion of the Centre Pointe complex and all related development and special declarant rights. Filmore\u2019s property is part of the Centre Point complex and subject to its Declaration. Section 9.1.14 of the Declaration provides that there is \u201cno restriction on the right of any Unit Owner to lease his or her Unit\u201d other than the restrictions described in section 9.1.14. CP at 55. Nothing in section 9.1.14 limits the number of units that may be leased.\n\u00b66 In October 2011, owners of Centre Pointe units to which at least 67 percent (but less than 90 percent) of the votes in Centre Pointe were allocated approved the 12th amendment to the Declaration, requiring that no more than 30 percent of the total number of units could be leased. In October 2012, Filmore filed a complaint in Whatcom County Superior Court, alleging that the Declaration\u2019s 12th amendment violated RCW 64.34.264(4) and section 17.3 of the Declaration because the 12th amendment was not passed with 90 percent of the eligible votes, and requesting that the 12th amendment be found void and unenforceable. The trial court granted CR 56 summary judgment in favor of Filmore on February 8, 2013, finding that the 12th amendment is void because it was not passed with 90 percent of the eligible votes. The Court of Appeals agreed in a published opinion. Filmore LLLP v. Unit Owner's Ass\u2019n of Centre Pointe Condo., 183 Wn. App. 328, 333 P.3d 498 (2014). We granted Centre Pointe\u2019s petition for review. 182 Wn.2d 1008 (2015).\nAnalysis\n\u00b67 Our review is de novo. Jones v. Allstate Ins. Co., 146 Wn.2d 291, 300, 45 P.3d 1068 (2002) (de novo review of summary judgment orders (citing Lybbert v. Grant County, 141 Wn.2d 29, 34, 1 P.3d 1124 (2000))); State v. Wentz, 149 Wn.2d 342, 346, 68 P.3d 282 (2003) (de novo review of statutory interpretation (citing City of Pasco v. Pub. Emp\u2019t Relations Comm\u2019n, 119 Wn.2d 504, 507, 833 P.2d 381 (1992))). Additionally,\n[a] condominium declaration is like a deed, the review of which is a mixed question of law and fact. Roeder Co. v. Burlington N., Inc., 105 Wn.2d 567, 571-72, 716 P.2d 855 (1986) (citing Veach v. Culp, 92 Wn.2d 570, 573, 599 P.2d 526 (1979)). The factual issue is the declarant\u2019s intent, which we discern from the face of the declaration. See id. The declaration\u2019s legal consequences are questions of law, which we review de novo.\nLake v. Woodcreek Homeowners Ass\u2019n, 169 Wn.2d 516, 526, 243 P.3d 1283 (2010).\n\u00b68 The vote or agreement of the owner of each unit particularly affected and the owners of units to which at least 90 percent of the votes are allocated must agree on any declaration amendment that changes \u201cthe uses to which any unit is restricted\u201d under RCW 64.34.264(4) and section 17.3 of the Declaration. The word \u201cuse\u201d is not defined in the WCA. \u201c When a statutory term is undefined, the words of a statute are given their ordinary meaning, and the court may look to a dictionary for such meaning.\u2019 \u201d Lake, 169 Wn.2d at 528 (quoting State v. Gonzalez, 168 Wn.2d 256, 263, 226 P.3d 131 (2010)). Dictionary definitions, however, are not dispositive here because \u201cuse\u201d is broadly defined in the dictionary to include \u201cthe legal enjoyment of property that consists in its employment, occupation, exercise, or practice,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2523 (2002), and also \u201c[t]he application or employment of something,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1775 (10th ed. 2014).\n\u00b69 But we need not interpret the WCA here because, in contrast to RCW 64.34.264(4), the Declaration itself identifies a number of \u201cuses\u201d that come within the special supermajority voting requirement in section 17.3. Under the Declaration\u2019s article IX, \u201cPermitted Uses; Architectural Uniformity\u201d and section 9.1, \u201cPermitted Uses,\u201d section 9.1.14 provides, \u201cLease Restrictions.\u201d CP at 52-55. The positioning of section 9.1.14 within the section 9.1 \u201cPermitted Uses\u201d heading indicates that for the purposes of this Declaration, a provision on leasing is one restricting the \u201cuse\u201d of a unit\u2014an amendment that requires a 90 percent vote under section 17.3. Id. This interpretation is bolstered by the fact that section 9.1.14 also provides that there is \u201cno restriction on the right of any Unit Owner to lease his or her Unit\u201d other than the restrictions set forth in Section 9.1.14, such as that \u201c[a]ll leases shall be in writing\u201d and \u201c[n]o lease shall have a term of less than one year,\u201d and nothing in section 9.1.14 limits the number of units that may be leased. Id. at 55. In other words, even if leasing is not a \u201cuse\u201d under RCW 64.34.264(4), it is one under the language of the Declaration that is subject to section 17.3\u2019s special super-majority amendment process. We resolve this case exclusively on that basis.\n\u00b610 Given that leasing is a \u201cuse\u201d under this Declaration, a 90 percent supermajority was required to agree on any declaration amendment that restricted leasing under RCW 64.34.264(4) and section 17.3 of the Declaration. Ninety percent supermajority approval was not received. Therefore, the 12th amendment is not valid.\nConclusion\n\u00b611 We find that the declaration amendment restricting leasing is not valid because it purported to change \u201cthe uses to which any unit is restricted\u201d without the requisite 90 percent supermajority approval. We find that the amendment is therefore invalid and affirm the courts below.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gordon McCloud, and Yu, JJ., concur.",

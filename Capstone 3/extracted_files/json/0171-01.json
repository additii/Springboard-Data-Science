        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b61 This case is a class action lawsuit by farmworkers against four corporate defendants. It requires us to answer two questions, certified to this court by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, about Washington\u2019s farm labor contractor act (FLCA), chapter 19.30 RCW. The first question implicates RCW 19.30-.010(2). That statute defines a \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d as \u201cany person, or his or her agent or subcontractor, who, for a fee, performs any farm labor contracting activity.\u201d Another FLCA provision, RCW 19.30.010(3), then defines \u201cfarm labor contracting activity\u201d as \u201crecruiting, soliciting, employing, supplying, transporting, or hiring agricultural employees.\u201d The second question implicates RCW 19.30.200. That statute imposes joint and several liability for FLCA violations on \u201c[a]ny person who knowingly uses the services of an unlicensed farm labor contractor\u201d and then states, \u201cIn making determinations under this section, any user may rely upon either the license issued by the director [of the Department of Labor & Industries (Department)] to the farm labor contractor under RCW 19.30.030 or the director\u2019s representation that such contractor is licensed as required by this chapter.\u201d\n\u00b62 The certified questions require us to decide whether defendant-appellant NW Management and Realty Services Inc. is a \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d under RCW 19.30.010(2) and, if so, whether the other defendants \u201cknowingly use[d]\u201d its services under RCW 19.30.200. (There is no dispute that NW was unlicensed at all times relevant to this case.)\nFACTS\n\u00b63 Defendant-appellant John Hancock Life Insurance Company owns defendant-appellant John Hancock Life & Health Insurance Co. (collectively Hancock companies). Together with defendant-appellant Texas Municipal Plans Consortium LLC (TMP), the Hancock companies owned three apple orchards.\n\u00b64 The Hancock companies and TMP leased all three orchards to defendant-appellant Farmland Management Services. Under the governing lease agreements, the Hancock companies and TMP paid Farmland a \u201cManagement Fee\u201d in exchange for either operating and managing the orchards or subleasing the orchards to a third party operator/manager. Appellants\u2019 Joint Excerpts of Sealed R. (ESR) at 98 (boldface omitted). The Hancock companies and TMP also reimbursed Farmland for operating costs and collected all profits.\n\u00b65 Farmland subleased the orchards to NW. Under the governing sublease agreement, Farmland paid NW a per-acre fee, reimbursed NW for all operating costs, and collected all profits. Ultimately, pursuant to all the lease and sublease agreements, the Hancock companies and TMP paid all of NWs costs and collected all of the orchards\u2019 profits, minus Farmland\u2019s \u201cManagement Fee.\u201d Id. (boldface omitted).\n\u00b66 The sublease agreement between Farmland and NW provided that NW \u201cwill hire, employ, discharge and supervise the work of all employees and independent contractors performing labor and/or services on the [orchards and that NW] shall be the employer of record of all persons employed to perform work on the [orchards].\u201d ESR at 38. The agreement left the details of orchard management largely to NW\u2019s discretion, but it provided that NW would \u201coperate and use the orchard Properties for the sole purpose of conducting a first-class agricultural operation,\u201d and it required NW to submit to Farmland a yearly \u201cFarm Operating Plan\u201d that included NW\u2019s anticipated budget for the coming year. ESR at 37,40. Farmland then sent this budget to the Hancock companies for approval.\n\u00b67 Farmland\u2019s lease agreements with the Hancock companies and TMP required Farmland to either obtain necessary licenses or require any third party to do so. A representative for Farmland told a representative for the Hancock companies that Farmland had fulfilled this contractual obligation. It is undisputed, however, that NW never obtained a farm labor contractor license.\n\u00b68 The plaintiffs-appellees, a class of 722 former NW employees, sued the defendants in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington for violations of state and federal law, including the FLCA. The district court certified the plaintiff class as to two FLCA claims: (1) that NW violated RCW 19.30.110(1) by failing to carry a current farm labor contractor\u2019s license and (2) that NW violated RCW 19.30.110(7) by making false and misleading representations about worker compensation. The plaintiffs allege, in part, that Farmland and the Hancock companies are jointly and severally liable for NW\u2019s violations under RCW 19.30.200 because they used the services of an unlicensed farm labor contractor without either inspecting NWs license or verifying licensure with the Department.\n\u00b69 Farmland, the Hancock companies, and TMP each moved to dismiss, arguing that RCW 19.30.200 penalizes only defendants with actual or constructive knowledge that a contractor is unlicensed. The trial court denied the motions, concluding that the FLCA imposes an affirmative duty on such defendants to verify proper licensure. All the defendants then moved for summary judgment on the ground that NW was not a \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d as defined in RCW 19.30.010(2) because it was instead an \u201cagricultural employer\u201d (defined in RCW 19.30.010(4)). The district court also denied that motion, concluding that those two definitions are not mutually exclusive.\n\u00b610 The plaintiffs then moved for summary judgment, arguing that NW was a farm labor contractor under the FLCA; that NW violated the FLCA by failing to obtain a farm labor contractor\u2019s license and by failing to provide the plaintiffs with required disclosures; and that Farmland, the Hancock companies, and TMP are jointly and severally liable for NW\u2019s violations. The district court granted the motion and awarded the plaintiffs damages of $500 per class member per violation per year worked, for a total of $1,004,000. The court also awarded the plaintiffs attorney fees.\n\u00b611 The defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit, briefing these issues on the merits and filing a joint excerpts of record (ER) containing the relevant documents. Then, on August 5, 2015, the Ninth Circuit certified the disputed questions to this court. Saucedo v. John Hancock Life & Health Ins. Co., 796 F.3d 1016 (9th Cir. 2015).\nANALYSIS\n\u00b612 Certified questions are matters of law reviewed de novo and in light of the record certified by the federal court. Carlsen v. Global Client Solutions, LLC, 171 Wn.2d 486, 493, 256 P.3d 321 (2011). Because the questions in this case pertain to a motion for summary judgment, we perform the same inquiry as the district court. Smith v. Safeco Ins. Co., 150 Wn.2d 478, 483, 78 P.3d 1274 (2003).\nI. The first certified question: Does the FLCA, in particular RCW 19.30.010(2), include in the definition of a \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d an entity who is paid a per-acre fee to manage all aspects of farming\u2014including hiring and employing agricultural workers as well as making all planting and harvesting decisions, subject to approval\u2014for a particular plot of land owned by a third party? Answer: Yes\n\u00b613 As noted above, RCW 19.30.010(2) defines a \u201cfarm labor contractor\u2019\u201d as \u201cany person, or his or her agent or subcontractor, who, for a fee, performs any farm labor contracting activity.\u201d Another FLCA provision in turn defines \u201cfarm labor contracting activity\u201d to mean \u201crecruiting, soliciting, employing, supplying, transporting, or hiring agricultural employees.\u201d RCW 19.30.010(3).\n\u00b614 NW is a farm labor contractor under the plain language of these provisions. Pursuant to their sublease agreement, Farmland paid NW a per-acre fee \u201c[a]s compensation for the services rendered by [NW] under this Agreement.\u201d ESR at 43. And pursuant to that agreement, those services included \u201chiring], employ[ing], discharging] and supervising] the work of all employees and independent contractors performing labor and/or services on the \u2018Properties\u2019.\u201d ESR at 38. That contractual arrangement places NW squarely within the plain definition of \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d under the FLCA: at a minimum, NW \u201cemploy [s]\u201d and \u201chir[es] agricultural employees\u201d in exchange \u201cfor a fee.\u201d RCW 19.30.010(3), (2).\n\u00b615 The defendants make two main arguments to support their contrary interpretation of the statute.\n\u00b616 First, the defendants point to a provision in the FLCA making that chapter inapplicable to \u201cany person who performs any [farm labor contracting activities] only within the scope of his or her regular employment for one agricultural employer on whose behalf he or she is so acting, unless he or she is receiving a commission or fee, which commission or fee is determined by the number of workers recruited.\u201d RCW 19.30.010(6) (emphasis added). The parties refer to this provision as the single-employer exemption. The defendants don\u2019t argue that the single-employer exemption actually applies to NW; they argue, instead, that the logic underlying the exemption applies equally to entities like NW. They contend that the legislature exempted single-employer contractors from FLCA coverage because \u201ctheir ties to one farmer ensured the requisite stability, permanence, and accountability\u201d and that NW possesses all of those qualities, having worked almost exclusively for Farmland and in the same general area for roughly 20 years. Br. of Defs.-Pet\u2019rs at 22-23. Their unstated conclusion is that these attributes make them as deserving of an exemption as someone actually eligible for the enacted single-employer exemption. But the legislature is the body that gets to make that policy decision by defining \u201cfarm labor contractor.\u201d RCW 19.30.010(2). If NW fits the definition of a \u201cfarm labor contractor,\u201d RCW 19.30.010(2), and is not eligible for any statutory exemption, then it must abide by the FLCA\u2019s licensure requirements. We have no authority to read a new exception into the statute on policy grounds. See Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Cmty., 572 U.S. _, 134 S. Ct. 2024, 2034, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1071 (2014) (\u201cThis Court has no roving license, in even ordinary cases of statutory interpretation, to disregard clear language simply on the view that . . . Congress \u2018must have intended\u2019 something broader.\u201d).\n\u00b617 Second, the defendants argue NW performs too many farming activities to be a farm labor contractor. They contend that the FLCA embraces a \u201cTripartite Scheme\u201d that distinguishes between three mutually exclusive categories: \u201cAgricultural employer\u201d (farmer), \u201cAgricultural employee\u201d (workers), and \u201cFarm labor contractor\u201d (broker). Br. of Defs.-Pet\u2019rs at 24 (boldface omitted). NW argues that because it is an agricultural employer, it cannot also be a farm labor contractor. But the legislature did not make the three categories of \u201cperson\u201d defined in RCW 19.30.010(2), (4), and (5) mutually exclusive. As the district court concluded in this case, \u201cThe fact that NW . . . also meets the statutory definition of\u2018agricultural employer\u2019 is irrelevant; [if it was] paid by a third party to \u2018recruit,\u2019 \u2018employ\u2019 and \u2018supply\u2019 farm laborers, see RCW 19.30.010(3), it was required to register.\u201d ER at 41.\nII. The second certified question: Does the FLCA, in particular RCW 19.30.200, make jointly and severally liable any person who uses the services of an unlicensed farm labor contractor without either inspecting the license issued by the director of the Department to the farm labor contractor or obtaining a representation from the director of the Department that the contractor is properly licensed, even if that person lacked knowledge that the farm labor contractor was unlicensed? Answer: Yes\n\u00b618 RCW 19.30.200 provides, in full:\nAny person who knowingly uses the services of an unlicensed farm labor contractor shall be personally, jointly, and severally liable with the person acting as a farm labor contractor to the same extent and in the same manner as provided in this chapter. In making determinations under this section, any user may rely upon either the license issued by the director [of the Department] to the farm labor contractor under RCW 19.30-.030 or the director\u2019s representation that such contractor is licensed as required by this chapter.\nThe parties offer competing interpretations of this provision.\n\u00b619 The defendants emphasize RCW 19.30.200\u2019s first sentence, which limits joint and several liability to those who \u201cknowingly\u201d use an unlicensed farm labor contractor. They argue that the second sentence (which lists two ways of determining whether a farm labor contractor has a license) creates a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for persons who rely on a license or the Department\u2019s representation of licensure, but does not create any affirmative duty to verify licensure. Br. of Defs.-Pet\u2019rs at 39-43. Accordingly, they conclude that the plaintiffs must prove that the Hancock companies and/or TMP had actual or constructive knowledge that NW was unlicensed in order to establish joint and several liability under RCW 19.30.200.\n\u00b620 The plaintiffs argue that RCW 19.30.200 gives the term \u201cknowingly\u201d a specific meaning: that a person \u201cknowingly\u201d uses an unlicensed farm labor contractor if he or she does so without using one of the two methods listed in that statute\u2019s second sentence\u2014inspecting the contractor\u2019s license or inquiring about the contractor\u2019s status with the Department. Answering Br. of Pls.-Resp\u2019ts at 24 (\u201c[a] user is required to make a determination based on one of two [specified] options!, and] [a]fter that determination is made, the user will know whether the labor contractor possesses a valid Washington license\u201d). Thus, the plaintiffs conclude that a person who fails to verify in one of these easy, straightforward ways must be charged with knowledge and is therefore jointly and severally liable under the statute for use of an unlicensed farm labor contractor.\n\u00b621 \u201cOur fundamental goal in statutory interpretation is to \u2018discern and implement the legislature\u2019s intent.\u2019 \u201d O.S.T. v. Regence BlueShield, 181 Wn.2d 691, 696, 335 P.3d 416 (2014) (quoting State v. Armendariz, 160 Wn.2d 106, 110, 156 P.3d 201 (2007)). For the reasons given below, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the statute must certainly be what the legislature intended when it enacted RCW 19.30.200.\n\u00b622 First, the statute\u2019s plain language\u2014specifically, the \u201ceither-or\u201d disjunctive phrasing that appears in the statute\u2019s second sentence\u2014normally implies that one or the other of two things will occur; it does not imply the option to pursue other, unspecified alternatives. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 728 (2002) (defining \u201ceither-or\u201d as \u201can unavoidable choice or exclusive division between only two alternatives\u201d). On this point, we note that the FLCA\u2019s federal analog, the agricultural worker protection act (AWPA), contains a \u201c[c]onfirmation of [registration\u201d provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1842, very similar to RCW 19.30.200. That provision states, in its entirety:\nNo person shall utilize the services of any farm labor contractor to supply any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker unless the person first takes reasonable steps to determine that the farm labor contractor possesses a certificate of registration which is valid and which authorizes the activity for which the contractor is utilized. In making that determination, the person may rely upon either possession of a certificate of registration, or confirmation of such registration by the Department of Labor. The Secretary shall maintain a central public registry of all persons issued a certificate of registration.\n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1842 (emphasis added). We are not aware of any case law interpreting this provision to allow \u201creasonable steps\u201d other than the two listed in the statute. Id.\n\u00b623 Second, our legislature enacted the FLCA to remedy a pattern of farmworker exploitation, in part by including tough civil penalty provisions \u201cto compensate injuries, promote enforcement . . . , and deter violations.\u201d Perez-Farias v. Glob. Horizons, Inc., 175 Wn.2d 518, 521, 530, 286 P.3d 46 (2012). As a remedial statute designed to prevent worker exploitation, the FLCA is generally construed liberally to further this purpose. Id. at 521, 530; see also Drinkwitz v. Alliant Techsystems, Inc., 140 Wn.2d 291, 301, 996 P.2d 582 (2000) (ch. 49.46 RCW (Washington Minimum Wage Act)); Schilling v. Radio Holdings, Inc., 136 Wn.2d 152, 159, 961 P.2d 371 (1998) (ch. 49.52 RCW). The defendants\u2019 interpretation of RCW 19.30.200 frustrates this intent by giving \u201cusers of farm labor contractors a perverse incentive to remain deliberately ignorant of a contractor\u2019s licensure status.\u201d ER at 47. The plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation, by contrast, furthers the statute\u2019s remedial purpose by codifying straightforward and easily complied with license verification requirements.\n\u00b624 In fact, as the district court concluded in this case, the defendants\u2019 interpretation of RCW 19.30.200 \u201crenders the \u2018determination\u2019 requirement optional.\u201d ER at 121-22. Under the defendants\u2019 interpretation, if a person elects to verify licensure, he or she may do so by inspecting the contractor\u2019s license or inquiring with the Department\u2014or not. As a practical matter, this reading renders RCW 19.30.200\u2019s second sentence all but superfluous. The plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation is much more persuasive: that the either-or \u201cmaking determinations\u201d provision in RCW 19.30-.200 clarifies the meaning of the term \u201cknowingly\u201d in the statute\u2019s first sentence.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b625 The plain language of the FLCA compels us to answer yes to both certified questions. Under RCW 19.30-.010(2) and (3), the definition of a \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d includes an entity who is paid a per-acre fee to manage all aspects of farming\u2014including hiring and employing agricultural workers as well as making all planting and harvesting decisions, subject to approval\u2014for a particular plot of land owned by a third party. Under RCW 19.30.200, any person who uses the services of an unlicensed farm labor contractor without either inspecting the contractor\u2019s license or obtaining a representation from the Department that the contractor is properly licensed is jointly and severally liable with that contractor, even if that person lacked knowledge that the farm labor contractor was unlicensed.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nThe defendants also attempt to avoid the statute\u2019s plain terms by citing a brief passage of dictum from Perez-Farias v. Global Horizons, Inc., which addressed provisions in the FLCA governing damages in a civil suit. 175 Wn.2d 518, 521, 286 P.3d 46 (2012). The passage states that the FLCA protects farmworkers by regulating the activities of \u201cfarm labor contractors,\u2019\u2019 who \u201cact as intermediary between farm workers and farmer [and] [generally . . . recruit, transport, house, and supervise farm workers, and handle their pay arrangements.\u2019\u2019 Id. The defendants would like us to interpret this passage as an exclusive list of all farm labor contracting activities, but doing so conflicts with the plain terms of the statutes at issue here.\nThis does not mean that a person becomes a \u201cfarm labor contractor\u2019\u2019 under the FLCA just because he or she employs agricultural workers in a farming operation that eventually turns a profit. In support of their argument that NW did not perform any farm labor contracting activities \u201cfor a fee,\u2019\u2019 RCW 19.30.010(2), the defendants cite only one directly relevant case: Escobar v. Baker, 814 F. Supp. 1491, 1495, 1500 n.9 (W.D. Wash. 1993). See Br. of Defs.-Pet\u2019rs at 20. In Escobar, a farmworker (Soto) worked as a foreman for one defendant (Baker) and as a row boss for another defendant (Dobbins). 814 F. Supp. at 1495-96. Baker gave Soto free gasoline in exchange for his picking up workers in Oregon and driving them to Baker\u2019s Washington farm. Id. at 1496. Eventually, through what appears to have been a long-standing informal arrangement between Baker and Dobbins, Soto also transported some of these workers to Dobbins\u2019 farm. Id. The district court held that Soto performed farm labor contracting activities \u201cfor a fee\u2019\u2019 as to Baker, but not as to Dobbins. Id. at 1499-1500. It concluded that the gasoline (from Baker) constituted a \u201cfee\u201d under the FLCA, but that Soto\u2019s salary as a row boss (for Dobbins) did not. Id. The court reasoned that a salary can sometimes constitute a \u201cfee\u201d under the FLCA but that to trigger coverage, there must be some \u201ctie\u201d between a salary and the farm labor contracting activities. Id. at 1500 n.9.\nThe defendants cite this portion of Escobar to argue that NW received a fee for its activities as an \u201c \u2018agricultural employer\u2019 \u2019\u2019 rather than a \u201c \u2018farm labor contractor.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Br. of Defs.-Pet\u2019rs at 20. But Escobar is clearly distinguishable from the present case. According to the Escobar court, Soto\u2019s driving workers to Dobbins\u2019 farm was incidental to and attenuated from the salary he received as Dobbins\u2019 row boss. 814 F. Supp. at 1499-1500 & n.9. By contrast, the contract at issue in this case explicitly conditions NW\u2019s receipt of the per-acre fee on NW\u2019s \u201chir[ing]\u2019\u2019 and \u201cemploy[ing]\u2019\u2019 agricultural workers. ESR at 38. The fact that the fee also compensates NW for other activities, such as managing orchards and repairing farm equipment, id., does not mean that NW\u2019s farm labor contracting activities are incidental to or attenuated from the per-acre fee.\nThe defendants contend that our legislature considered and rejected arguments that a knowledge prerequisite to liability under RCW 19.30.200 would facilitate intentional ignorance. They are incorrect. That history demonstrates only that our legislature rejected one lobbyist\u2019s suggestion that it strike the word \u201cknowingly\u201d from a bill that eventually became RCW 19.30.200. But if the \u201cmaking determinations\u201d clause is an affirmative inquiry requirement, there was no need to omit the word \u201cknowingly\u201d (and thereby impose the harsh standard of strict liability), RCW 19.30.200, in order to punish intentional ignorance.\nThe defendants contend that the rule of lenity applies here because the PLCA imposes some criminal sanctions, specifically on \u201c[a]ny person who violates any provisions of. .. chapter [19.30 RCW], or who causes or induces another to violate any provisions of this chapter.\u201d RCW 19.30.150. They argue that the imposition of criminal sanctions triggers the rule of lenity. See United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Co., 504 U.S. 505, 518 n.10, 112 S. Ct. 2102, 119 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1992) (plurality opinion) (holding that the rule of lenity applies to a tax statute with both criminal and civil applications). But RCW 19.30.200\u2014the specific statute at issue here\u2014imposes no criminal sanctions at all. As noted above, the FLCA imposes criminal penalties on a person who \u201cviolates\u201d its provisions. RCW 10.30.150. The only provision violated here was RCW 19.30.110(1), the separate statute that requires a \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d to \u201c[c]arry a current farm labor contractor\u2019s license.\u201d RCW 19.30.200 does not establish that duty, which only NW violated; it just clarifies the extent of the other defendants\u2019 civil liability for NWs violation. We therefore reject the argument that the rule of lenity applies to that statute.",

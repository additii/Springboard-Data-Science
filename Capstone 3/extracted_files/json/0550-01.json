        "text": "Owens, J.\n\u00b61 Brian Brush was convicted of first degree murder for killing his ex-fianc\u00e9e. The trial court imposed an exceptional sentence based on the jury\u2019s finding that the murder was an aggravated domestic violence offense. Brush appeals the domestic violence finding on two grounds. First, he challenges a jury instruction defining \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d in the context of the domestic violence aggravating factor. He contends that this instruction violated the constitutional rule against judges commenting on the evidence. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 16. The Court of Appeals agreed, and we affirm. The instruction defining \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d essentially resolved a factual question for the jury and thereby constituted an improper comment on the evidence. Accordingly, we reverse Brush\u2019s exceptional sentence and remand to the trial court with instructions that, if requested, it may impanel a jury to consider evidence of a prolonged pattern of abuse.\n\u00b62 Second, Brush challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to admit certain hearsay statements made by the victim\u2019s daughter during the sentencing phase of his trial. Although we reverse his exceptional sentence on another ground, we address this issue because it is likely to come up on remand. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed the victim\u2019s daughter to testify because her testimony related to an incident where Brush stalked her and her mother. The judge properly ruled that her mother\u2019s statements made at the time of the incident fell under the excited utterance and present sense impression exceptions to the rule against hearsay.\nFACTS\n\u00b63 On September 11, 2009, Brush shot his ex-fianc\u00e9e four times with a shotgun. The shooting occurred on a beach in view of several witnesses, including three police officers who were patrolling an event on the beach. The officers arrested Brush immediately at the scene. The State charged him with first degree murder and alleged multiple aggravating factors, including \u2014 at issue here \u2014 that the offense involved aggravated domestic violence. The trial was bifurcated into a guilt phase and a penalty phase. At the end of the guilt phase, the jury found Brush guilty of first degree murder. The jury also found multiple aggravating factors, including that Brush\u2019s conduct manifested deliberate cruelty to the victim, that the victim\u2019s injuries substantially exceeded the level of bodily harm necessary to satisfy the elements of the offense, and that the crime was an aggravated domestic violence offense.\n\u00b64 The two issues in this case both involve the penalty phase \u2014 specifically, the testimony of the victim\u2019s daughter and the jury instruction on the domestic violence aggravating factor.\nTestimony by the Victim\u2019s Daughter\n\u00b65 The only evidence presented during the penalty phase was testimony by the victim\u2019s daughter. She testified about an incident that had occurred in August 2009, when she and her mother went for a walk outside her mother\u2019s house and Brush began following them in his truck. She testified that her mother was very scared and that as Brush revved the engine near them, her mother realized that he was not going to simply drive by and said, \u201c \u2018He\u2019s not stopping. Run.\u2019 \u201d11 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Dec. 6, 2011) at 179 (formatting omitted). They ended up hiding behind some cars in a nearby parking lot. Her mother was bawling, shaking, and throwing up. Her mother stated that a similar stalking incident had happened earlier that same day. The victim\u2019s daughter then described a number of phone calls and text messages she had received from Brush that day about her mother cheating on him.\n\u00b66 The defense challenged all of the victim\u2019s daughter\u2019s statements as hearsay, and the judge ruled that the statements fell within the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.\nDomestic Violence Aggravating Factor\n\u00b67 During the penalty phase, the trial court instructed the jury to determine whether the crime was an aggravated domestic violence offense. To find that Brush\u2019s crime was an aggravated domestic violence offense, the jury had to find two elements: (1) that the victim and the defendant were family or household members and (2) that the offense was part of an ongoing pattern of psychological abuse of the victim \u201cmanifested by multiple incidents over a prolonged period of time.\u201d RCW 9.94A.535(3)(h)(i).\n\u00b68 The instruction at issue in this case explained, \u201cAn \u2018ongoing pattern of abuse\u2019 means multiple incidents of abuse over a prolonged period of time. The term \u2018prolonged period of time\u2019 means more than a few weeks.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 229.\n\u00b69 The evidence at trial showed that the other incidents of abuse occurred during a two-month period prior to the September 11, 2009 murder. Brush hit the victim\u2019s car with a hammer after an argument occurred in July 2009, and the stalking described by the victim\u2019s daughter occurred in August 2009. A defense expert acknowledged, \u201cI know he was following [the victim] around and calling her and dogging her throughout this period of time after [the July 2009 incident].\u201d 9 VRP (Dec. 5, 2011) at 139. The defense expert also referenced statements made by Brush that he would financially ruin the victim. Brush made those statements at couples counseling around that same time period.\n\u00b610 The jury found that Brush\u2019s offense was an aggravated domestic violence offense.\nExceptional Sentence and Appeal\n\u00b611 The standard range sentence was 240-320 months. The trial judge imposed an exceptional sentence of 1,000 months and a 60-month firearm enhancement. The trial judge explained that the exceptional sentence was justified by the aggravating factors found by the jury and that those factors \u201ctaken together or considered individually constitute [d] sufficient cause to impose the exceptional sentence.\u201d CP at 54. He stated, \u201cThis Court would impose the same sentence if only one of the [aggravating factors] is valid.\u201d Id.\n\u00b612 Brush appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction but reversed his exceptional sentence. State v. Brush, noted at 181 Wn. App. 1009, 2014 WL 1912009, at *8, 2014 Wash. App. LEXIS 1183, at *23. The Court of Appeals ruled that not one of the aggravating factors could be sustained based on the record. 2014 WL 1912009, at *8, 2014 Wash. App. LEXIS 1183, at *23. On the issue now in front of this court, the Court of Appeals held that the jury instruction on \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d constituted an improper comment on the evidence. 2014 WL 1912009, at *7, 2014 Wash. App. LEXIS 1183, at *20-21. The Court of Appeals remanded to the superior court \u201cfor resentencing with instructions that the trial court may, if requested, impanel a jury to consider evidence of a prolonged pattern of abuse.\u201d 2014 WL 1912009, at *8, 2014 Wash. App. LEXIS 1183, at *23-24.\n\u00b613 The State petitioned this court for review solely on the issue of the \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d jury instruction. Brush filed an answer and cross petition raising a number of additional issues. We granted the State\u2019s petition and review of one issue raised by Brush: whether the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted the victim\u2019s daughter\u2019s testimony regarding statements made by her mother. State v. Brush, 181 Wn.2d 1007, 335 P.3d 940 (2014).\nISSUES\n\u00b614 1. Did the pattern jury instruction defining \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d constitute an improper comment on the evidence?\n\u00b615 2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it ruled that the victim\u2019s daughter\u2019s testimony regarding her mother\u2019s statements qualified as excited utterances?\nANALYSIS\n1. The Pattern Jury Instruction on \u201cProlonged Period of Time\u201d Constituted an Improper Comment on the Evidence in This Case\n\u00b616 The Washington State Constitution does not allow judges to \u201ccharge juries with respect to matters of fact, nor comment thereon.\u201d Const, art. IV, \u00a7 16. Instead, they \u201cshall declare the law.\u201d Id. \u201cA jury instruction that does no more than accurately state the law pertaining to an issue, however, does not constitute an impermissible comment on the evidence by the trial judge.\u201d State v. Woods, 143 Wn.2d 561, 591, 23 P.3d 1046 (2001). But, as described below, the jury instruction regarding \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d in this case did not accurately state the law. Since the definition essentially resolved a contested factual issue (whether the abuse occurred over a \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d), it constituted an improper comment on the evidence and effectively relieved the prosecution of its burden of establishing an element of the domestic violence aggravating factor. As a result, we reverse Brush\u2019s exceptional sentence, which was based on that aggravating factor.\nA. The Jury Instruction Incorrectly Interpreted Case Law and Resulted in an Improper Comment on the Evidence\n\u00b617 The jury instruction used in this case reflected the pattern jury instruction, which states, \u201cThe term \u2018prolonged period of time\u2019 means more than a few weeks.\u201d 11A Washington Practice: Washington Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal 300.17, at 719 (3d ed. 2008) (WPIC). This pattern jury instruction is based on State v. Barnett, 104 Wn. App. 191, 203, 16 P.3d 74 (2001). In Barnett, a trial judge imposed an exceptional sentence based on four factors, including that the offenses were part of a pattern of abuse over a \u201c \u2018prolonged two week period of time.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 202. The Court of Appeals reversed the exceptional sentence, finding that \u201c[t]wo weeks is not a prolonged period of time.\u201d Id. at 203. The Court of Appeals reviewed three prior Court of Appeals cases and concluded that they \u201csuggested] that years are required\u201d in order to find a \u201cprolonged period of time.\u201d Id. (citing State v. Schmeck, 98 Wn. App. 647, 651, 990 P.2d 472 (1999); State v. Duvall, 86 Wn. App. 871, 877, 940 P.2d 671 (1997); State v. Quigg, 72 Wn. App. 828, 841, 866 P.2d 655 (1994)).\n\u00b618 Thus, the Barnett holding that two weeks was not a \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d resulted in the pattern jury instruction: \u201cThe term \u2018prolonged period of time\u2019 means more than a few weeks,\u201d WPIC 300.17. That language is an inaccurate interpretation of the holding of Barnett because it implies that any abuse that occurs for more than a few weeks is a \u201cprolonged period of time.\u201d However, Barnett did not provide a legal definition of \u201cprolonged period of time.\u201d It held only that two weeks was not legally sufficient to be a \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d \u2014 not that abuse occurring longer than two weeks would be legally sufficient.\n\u00b619 Furthermore, the question faced by the court in Barnett was whether the specific facts in that case were legally sufficient for the court to uphold an exceptional sentence based on abuse occurring over a \u201cprolonged period of time.\u201d This is not an appropriate basis on which to create a jury instruction defining \u201cprolonged period of time.\u201d Thus, we clarify that legal definitions should not be fashioned out of courts\u2019 findings regarding legal sufficiency.\n\u00b620 Perhaps more importantly, we question the propriety of instructing the jury based on case law that did not take into account the jury\u2019s role in determining facts that increase the penalty for a crime. Barnett was published prior to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004). In Blakely, the Court held that a defendant has the right for a jury to determine any fact that increases the penalty for a crime. Id. at 301, 313-14. The Court of Appeals has explained that after Blakely, the jury must determine whether a particular pattern of abuse occurred over a \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d \u2014 not the trial court. See State v. Epefanio, 156 Wn. App. 378, 392, 234 P.3d 253 (2010). Given this change, we are hard pressed to see why a jury should be instructed on pr e-Blakely case law involving a trial court\u2019s judgment regarding whether abuse occurred over a \u201cprolonged period of time.\u201d\n\u00b621 Having concluded that the jury instruction incorrectly interpreted the law, we must now determine whether the instruction constituted an improper comment on the evidence. We hold that the instruction constituted an improper comment on the evidence because it resolved a contested factual issue for the jury. The instruction essentially stated that if the abuse occurred over a time period that was longer than a few weeks, it met the definition of a \u201cprolonged period of time.\u201d This is similar to State v. Levy, 156 Wn.2d 709, 721-22, 132 P.3d 1076 (2006), where the jury instructions referred to a crowbar as an example of a deadly weapon. We held that those instructions were an improper judicial comment on the evidence because they relieved the State of its burden to prove the crowbar was used in a way that met the definition of a \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d In the same way, the instruction here relieved the State of its burden to show that the pattern of abuse occurred over a \u201cprolonged period of time.\u201d As long as the State showed that the abuse lasted longer than a few weeks, the jury was instructed to find that the abuse occurred over a \u201cprolonged period of time.\u201d\nB. A Judicial Comment on the Evidence Is Presumed To Be Prejudicial, and the Record in This Case Does Not Rehut That Presumption\n\u00b622 \u201cJudicial comments are presumed to be prejudicial, and the burden is on the State to show that the defendant was not prejudiced, unless the record affirmatively shows that no prejudice could have resulted.\u201d Id. at 723.\n\u00b623 In this case, the evidence showed that incidents of abuse occurred during a two-month period prior to the murder. As a result, defining a \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d as \u201cmore than a few weeks\u201d likely affected the jury\u2019s finding on this issue. The abuse occurred over a time period just longer than a few weeks, and a straightforward application of the jury instruction would likely lead a jury to conclude that the abuse in this case met the given definition of a \u201cprolonged period of time.\u201d Most certainly, the State does not meet the high burden of showing from the record that \u201cno prejudice could have resulted.\u201d Id. As a result, the Court of Appeals correctly reversed Brush\u2019s exceptional sentence on this basis.\n2. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Admitting the Victim\u2019s Daughter\u2019s Testimony regarding Statements Made by Her Mother during a Stalking Incident\n\u00b624 During the penalty phase of trial, the judge allowed the victim\u2019s daughter to testify about statements her mother made. The defense objected to the statements as hearsay, but the judge ruled that the statements fell under the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. 11 VRP (Dec. 6, 2011) at 166.\n\u00b625 Although hearsay is generally not admissible, ER 802, there are two exceptions that apply in this case. First, under the excited utterance exception, \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition\u201d is not excluded as hearsay. ER 803(a)(2). Second, under the present sense impression exception, \u201c[a] statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter\u201d is not excluded as hearsay. ER 803(a)(1).\n\u00b626 The trial judge was largely correct that the victim\u2019s daughter\u2019s statements fell under exceptions to the hearsay rule. The victim\u2019s daughter\u2019s testimony mostly related to her experiences and observations during the stalking incident. This included describing statements made by her mother about the events as they were happening (as they were realizing that Brush was not slowing his truck and that they needed to run away and hide from him). For example, she described her mother\u2019s statements regarding where they should hide and whether to call the police. Most of her mother\u2019s statements fell directly under the present sense impression and excited utterance exceptions to the hearsay rule because they either (1) related to a startling event or condition and were made while under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition or (2) were describing or explaining an event or condition made while her mother was perceiving the event or condition.\n\u00b627 The only testimony that might not have fit within a hearsay exception was the victim\u2019s daughter\u2019s testimony relating her mother\u2019s brief description of an event that happened earlier that same day as the stalking incident, when Brush similarly drove by in his truck. The victim\u2019s statements about that earlier incident included only the fact that he had driven by and that the victim had been \u201c \u2018really, really scared.\u2019 \u201d 11 VRP (Dec. 6, 2011) at 185-87 (formatting omitted). Even if admitting those two statements was error, it was harmless in light of the victim\u2019s daughter\u2019s testimony about Brush following them in his car later that evening and her observations of her mother\u2019s fear during that time.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b628 We affirm the Court of Appeals and hold that the pattern jury instruction incorrectly stated the law on what constitutes a \u201cprolonged period of time.\u201d The instruction resulted in an improper comment on the evidence in this case. We reverse Brush\u2019s exceptional sentence and remand to the trial court with instructions that, if requested, it may impanel a jury to consider evidence of a prolonged pattern of abuse.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Gordon McCloud, JJ., concur.",

        "text": "Wiggins, J.\n\u00b629 (concurring in part and concurring in result) \u2014 I fully join Section 2 of the majority\u2019s opinion, rejecting the defendant\u2019s hearsay challenge. I also agree with the majority that the trial court\u2019s \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d instruction inaccurately states the law, that the erroneous instruction prejudiced the defendant, and that his conviction therefore should be reversed. Nevertheless, I write separately because I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s holding that the instruction\u2019s misstatement of the law constitutes a comment on the evidence under article IV, section 16 of our state constitution. Instead, I view the trial court\u2019s erroneous instruction as just that \u2014 an erroneous instruction of law \u2014 and would analyze it under our jurisprudence regarding instructional errors.\n\u00b630 The purpose of article IV, section 16 \u201cis to prevent the jury from being influenced by knowledge conveyed to it by the trial judge as to his opinion of the evidence submitted.\u201d State v. Jacobsen, 78 Wn.2d 491, 495, 477 P.2d 1 (1970). A trial court does not violate article IV, section 16 unless it conveys or allows the jury to infer a personal opinion of the judge regarding the credibility, weight, or sufficiency of some evidence introduced at trial. See, e.g., id. These principles have been reaffirmed time and again in our article IV, section 16 jurisprudence throughout the 126-year history of that provision. The majority does not examine these fundamental principles. Instead, it relies heavily on narrowly selected portions of two relatively recent opinions and presents its explication of those cases as an adequate representation of the standards for determining whether an instruction violates article IV, section 16. As a result, the majority holds that the trial court\u2019s \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d instruction was a comment on the evidence even though the instruction cannot plausibly be viewed as communicating the trial judge\u2019s personal attitude toward the merits of the case.\n\u00b631 The instruction in this case neither stated nor suggested anything whatsoever about the specific facts of the case at bar. Consequently, the instruction, though legally erroneous, did not violate article IV, section 16. But because the instruction was erroneous and prejudicial, the defendant is nevertheless entitled to a new trial.\nANALYSIS\nI. The \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d instruction misstated the law and thus constituted reversible error\n\u00b632 I agree with the majority that the \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d instruction was erroneous because it provided an incorrect and prejudicial rule of law. As the majority correctly notes, the most natural reading of the instruction is that it provides a definition of \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d under which periods of more than a few weeks are considered \u201cprolonged.\u201d This is both contrary to the law and prejudicial to the defendant for the reasons the majority states.\n\u00b633 \u201cWhere the error is not of constitutional magnitude, we apply the rule that \u2018error is not prejudicial unless, within reasonable probabilities, had the error not occurred, the outcome of the trial would have been materially affected.\u2019 \u201d State v. Smith, 106 Wn.2d 772, 780, 725 P.2d 951 (1986) (quoting State v. Cunningham, 93 Wn.2d 823, 831, 613 P.2d 1139 (1980)). The disputed instruction in Brush\u2019s case easily meets that standard for prejudice. The State presented evidence showing that the abuse occurred over a period of approximately two months prior to the murder. As the majority correctly notes, \u201c[A] straightforward application of the jury instruction would likely lead a jury to conclude that the abuse in this case met the given definition of a \u2018prolonged period of time.\u2019 \u201d Majority at 559. We cannot say that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict without this instruction because our law is silent on the meaning of \u201cprolonged\u201d under the relevant statute. There thus is a reasonable probability that the error prejudiced the defendant. For these reasons, I concur in the majority\u2019s result reversing Brush\u2019s exceptional sentence.\nII. The trial court\u2019s instruction did not violate article IV, section 16\nA. Background on article IV, section 16\n\u00b634 Article IV, section 16 provides:\nJudges shall not charge juries with respect to matters of fact, nor comment thereon, but shall declare the law.\nConst, art. IV, \u00a7 16 (emphasis added). As the above-emphasized text indicates, article IV, section 16 contains two separate prohibitions. The first prohibition is that judges must not charge the jury regarding matters of fact. The second prohibition in article IV, section 16 prohibits courts from commenting on matters of fact. Obviously, these prohibitions overlap considerably. See, e.g., State v. Lane, 125 Wn.2d 825, 839, 889 P.2d 929 (1995) (court\u2019s reading of a statement regarding the reason for a prosecution witness\u2019s early release from prison \u201ccharged the jury with a fact and expressly conveyed his opinion regarding the evidence\u201d (emphasis added)). Consequently, our courts often refer to both prohibitions collectively as \u201ccommenting] on the evidence.\u201d Id.\n\u00b635 A trial court violates article IV, section 16 when it \u201cconveys to the jury a judge\u2019s personal attitudes toward the merits of the case or allows the jury to infer from what the judge said or did not say that the judge personally believed or disbelieved the particular testimony in question.\u201d Hamilton v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 111 Wn.2d 569, 571, 761 P.2d 618 (1988). \u201cThe purpose of prohibiting judicial comments on the evidence is to prevent the trial judge\u2019s opinion from influencing the jury.\u201d Lane, 125 Wn.2d at 838.\n\u00b636 The element of conveying the judge\u2019s personal opinion is essential for a judge\u2019s words or actions to constitute a comment on the evidence:\nThe purpose of Const, art. 4, \u00a7 16 is to prevent the jury from being influenced by knowledge conveyed to it by the trial judge as to his opinion of the evidence submitted. In keeping with this purpose, we have consistently held that this constitutional prohibition forbids only those words or actions which have the effect of conveying to the jury a personal opinion of the trial judge regarding the credibility, weight or sufficiency of some evidence introduced at the trial.\nJacobsen, 78 Wn.2d at 495 (emphasis added). Put another way, \u201c[t]he touchstone of error in a trial court\u2019s comment on the evidence is whether the feeling of the trial court as to the truth value of the testimony of a witness has been communicated to the jury.\u201d Lane, 125 Wn.2d at 838.\n\u00b637 Thus, our courts have held that a trial court violates article IV, section 16 when a judge gives an instruction that tells the jury what weight it should assign to certain evidence. We have also struck down instructions that expressed the judge\u2019s opinion on how the jury should evaluate evidence of a certain type, such as alibi evidence or eyewitness testimony, if evidence of that type had been presented during trial. These rules are logical applications of the general rule prohibiting instructions that allow the jury to infer the judge\u2019s personal beliefs regarding the credibility, weight, or sufficiency of specific trial evidence.\n\u00b638 On the other hand, our jurisprudence establishes that a jury instruction does not become a comment on the evidence merely because the instruction incorrectly states the applicable law. See Haaga v. Saginaw Logging Co., 169 Wash. 547, 554-55, 14 P.2d 55 (1932) {Haaga II). In Haaga II, we held that a jury instruction was \u201ccontrary to law\u201d but did not constitute a comment on the evidence because the judge made no reference to any fact \u201cin his instructions either directly or in such a way as to lead, or tend to lead, the jury to infer that such fact was an established one.\u201d Id. at 554-57.\nB. Application of our article IV, section 16 jurisprudence principles to Brush\u2019s case\n\u00b639 With this overview of the relevant constitutional jurisprudence in mind, we may assess the propriety of the disputed instruction read in Brush\u2019s case. The \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d instruction stated nothing about the specific facts of the case at hand. Instead, the instruction purported to provide the legal meaning of a legal term. The instruction is erroneous because it misinformed the jury regarding the law, not because it instead charged the jury regarding a matter of fact or commented on the merits of the case. Consequently, it was not a comment on the evidence.\n\u00b640 Had the trial court modified the pattern instruction so that it somehow referenced the particular facts of Brush\u2019s case \u2014 for example, by stating that the evidence showed that the defendant had committed acts of abuse over a two-month period \u2014 this result would be different. But here, the instruction was copied word for word from a pattern jury instruction. The pattern jury instructions are, of course, not written with the facts of any particular case in mind, and this instruction was not modified in any way from its decidedly generic form. It is not plausible to view the instruction as an expression of the trial judge\u2019s personal views on the evidence in Brush\u2019s particular case, and it is difficult to see how the jury could possibly have viewed the instruction as conveying the judge\u2019s personal opinion about the sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence. Cf. id. at 557 (\u201cIt is only by a refined, technical reasoning and analysis that one could arrive at appellants\u2019 interpretation of the instruction [as a comment on the evidence]; it is difficult to see how the jury would ever place such construction upon it.\u201d). For these reasons, the instruction does not violate article IV, section 16.\n\u00b641 The two article IV, section 16 cases that the majority cites do not support its holding \u2014 a holding that, if followed, would effectively overturn our long-standing jurisprudence tying article IV, section 16 to comments and instructions that would permit the jury to infer the judge\u2019s personal views on specific evidence presented at trial.\n\u00b642 The majority first quotes State v. Woods, 143 Wn.2d 561, 23 P.3d 1046 (2001), for the proposition that \u201c \u2018[a] jury instruction that does no more than accurately state the law pertaining to an issue ... does not constitute an impermissible comment on the evidence by the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d Majority at 557 (quoting Woods, 143 Wn.2d at 591). But this quote from Woods does not convert all instructions that are legally erroneous into comments on the evidence. As Woods recognized in the sentence immediately preceding the one that the majority quotes, \u201c \u00a3[a]n impermissible comment is one which conveys to the jury a judge\u2019s personal attitudes toward the merits of the case.\u2019 \u201d Woods, 143 Wn.2d at 591 (quoting State v. Swan, 114 Wn.2d 613, 657, 790 P.2d 610 (1990)). Furthermore, our prior jurisprudence establishes that even an instruction that is contrary to law does not constitute a comment on the evidence unless the instruction somehow reveals the judge\u2019s personal views regarding some of the evidence presented. See Haaga II, 169 Wash, at 556-57. Viewed in its proper context, then, the quote from Woods regarding an instruction\u2019s legal accuracy merely presents a corollary to the general rule regarding judicial comments \u2014 specifically, that a jury cannot glean the judge\u2019s personal view of the facts from an instruction that does no more than correctly state the law.\n\u00b643 Moreover, tying article IV, section 16 to an instruction\u2019s legal accuracy would result in a rule that would be both overinclusive and underinclusive. Such a rule would be overinclusive because some inaccurate statements of the law, like the erroneous instruction in this case, could not plausibly be interpreted by the jury as reflecting the judge\u2019s personal opinion of the evidence. A legal-correctness rule would also be underinclusive because there may be circumstances under which accurate statements of the law may nevertheless be comments on the evidence.\n\u00b644 Rather than adopting such a rule, we should adhere to our long-standing jurisprudence and reaffirm that an instruction violates article IV, section 16 when (and only when) it \u201cconveys to the jury a judge\u2019s personal attitudes toward the merits of the case or allows the jury to infer from what the judge said or did not say that the judge personally believed or disbelieved\u201d some evidence at trial. Hamilton, 111 Wn.2d at 571.\n\u00b645 The majority also concludes, relying on State v. Levy, 156 Wn.2d 709, 132 P.3d 1076 (2006), that the trial court\u2019s instruction was a comment on the evidence because it \u201crelieved the State of its burden to show that the pattern of abuse occurred over a \u2018prolonged period of time.\u2019 \u201d Majority at 559. As with the quote from Woods, presenting this statement from Levy as a stand-alone rule for determining article IV, section 16 violations ignores our firmly established jurisprudence.\n\u00b646 Levy, like all cases in which we have found article IV, section 16 violations, addressed a judicial instruction that referenced specific evidence that had been introduced at trial. See Levy, 156 Wn.2d at 721. In Levy, the defendants were charged with first degree burglary, two elements of which are that the defendants (1) entered a \u201c \u2018building\u2019 \u201d while (2) \u201c \u2018armed with a deadly weapon.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 716. The disputed instructions included \u201cto-wit\u201d statements that specifically named the address where the offense occurred and called it a \u201cbuilding\u201d and referred to the two types of weapons that the defendants allegedly carried (a .38 caliber revolver and a crowbar) as \u201c \u2018deadly weapons.\u2019 \u201d Id. Similarly, in State v. Becker, the primary case on which Levy relied, the disputed special verdict form specifically named the educational institution where the crime occurred and referred to it as \u201c \u2018school grounds\u2019 \u201d in a case where the offense had to occur \u201c \u2018within 1000 feet of the perimeter of school grounds\u2019 \u201d under one of the aggravating factors that the jury was asked to consider. 132 Wn.2d 54, 64, 935 P.2d 1321 (1997).\n\u00b647 Again, viewing these holdings in light of our prior jurisprudence rather than in isolation, our holdings in Becker and Levy are simply applications of the general principle that instructions cannot permit a jury to infer the judge\u2019s personal opinion on the truth, weight, or sufficiency of specific evidence introduced at trial. Jacobsen, 78 Wn.2d at 495. Here, in contrast to Becker and Levy, the disputed instruction makes no reference whatsoever to any facts or evidence presented at trial. Had the jury instruction stated, \u201cA prolonged period of time, to wit: two months,\u201d then the analogy to Levy would hold. But Levy and Becker do not require that we find comments on the evidence in cases where the instructions make no reference whatsoever to the merits of the case at hand.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b648 For the reasons stated above, I concur in result.\nFairhurst, Stephens, and Yu, JJ., concur with Wiggins, J.\nSee, e.g., Patten v. Town of Auburn, 41 Wash. 644, 647, 84 P. 594 (1906) (intent of article IV, section 16 was not to \u201cimpose any undue restraint upon a trial judge in passing upon the competency or admissibility of evidence, or in instructing the jury as to the law,\u201d but rather \u201cto provide against any undue influence being exerted upon the jury by the judge communicating to them his opinion as to facts proven or not proven by the evidence\u201d); Haaga v. Saginaw Logging Co., 169 Wash. 547, 556-57, 14 P.2d 55 (1932) (Haaga II) (purpose of article IV, section 16 \u201cis simply to prevent the judge from influencing the jury in their findings upon questions of fact\u201d); Heitfeld v. Benevolent & Protective Order of Keglers, 36 Wn.2d 685, 699, 220 P.2d 655 (1950) (\u201cThe object of this constitutional provision is to prevent the juiy from being influenced by knowledge conveyed to it by the court as to the court\u2019s opinion of the evidence submitted.\u201d); Hamilton v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 111 Wn.2d 569, 571, 761 P.2d 618 (1988) (\u201cAn impermissible comment is one which conveys to the jury a judge\u2019s personal attitudes toward the merits of the case or allows the jury to infer from what the judge said or did not say that the judge personally believed or disbelieved the particular testimony in question.\u201d); State v. Lane, 125 Wn.2d 825, 838, 889 P.2d 929 (1995) (\u201cThe touchstone of error in a trial court\u2019s comment on the evidence is whether the feeling of the trial court as to the truth value of the testimony of a witness has been communicated to the jury.\u201d).\nThe comment to the pattern instruction notes that \u201ccases construing the \u2018prolonged period of time\u2019 requirement have not set a minimum length of time.\u201d 11A Washington Practice: Washington Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal 300.17 emt. at 720 (3d ed. 2008) (WPIC) (emphasis added). This suggests that the WPIC committee did not intend this instruction to be construed as providing a legal definition of \u201cprolonged.\u201d But because the more natural reading of the instruction is as a legal definition \u2014 and one that does not accurately state the law \u2014 reading it in Brush\u2019s case was error.\nHad the instruction omitted the \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d element altogether, the error would be constitutional in nature and per se prejudicial, thus requiring reversal without the defendant having to establish prejudice. See State v. McHenry, 13 Wn. App. 421, 535 P.2d 843 (1975), aff\u2019d, 88 Wn.2d 211, 558 P.2d 188 (1977). We also would presume prejudice had the instruction been given on behalf of the prevailing party. State v. Wanrow, 88 Wn.2d 221, 237, 559 P.2d 548 (1977). Here, however, it appears that the court simply included the standard WPIC for the aggravating factor; the record does not indicate that the instruction was given on behalf of the State.\nSee, e.g., In re Det. of R.W., 98 Wn.App. 140, 144, 988 P.2d 1034 (1999) (judge instructed jury that \u201c \u2018great weight\u2019 \u201d should be given to evidence regarding a defendant\u2019s \u201c \u2018prior history of decompensation leading to repeated hospitalizations or law enforcement interventions\u2019 \u201d (emphasis omitted)).\nSee, e.g., State v. Thompson, 132 Wash. 124, 231 P. 461 (1924) (instruction stating that \u201cthe defense of an alibi is one easily fabricated, easy to prove, and hard to disprove\u201d); State v. Faucett, 22 Wn. App. 869, 875, 593 P.2d 559 (1979) (instruction stating, \u201c \u201cYou will be slow to believe that any witness has testified falsely in the case\u2019 \u201d (some emphasis omitted)).\nThe cited opinion was issued by this court sitting en banc. The departmental opinion that preceded it discusses the underlying facts in greater detail. See Haaga v. Saginaw Logging Co., 165 Wash. 367, 368-73, 5 P.2d 505 (1931) (Haaga I), adhered to on reh\u2019g, Haaga II, 169 Wash. 547. In Haaga, the plaintiff suffered injury after a train struck an automobile in which he was a passenger. Id. at 368-70. The plaintiff brought a suit for negligence against the train operator and presented witnesses who testified that the train had not sounded any warning signal (i.e., the train\u2019s whistle) as it approached the crossing. Id. at 372-73. The trial court gave an instruction that stated, incorrectly, that a train\u2019s right-of-way at a railroad crossing is conditioned on the train operator\u2019s sounding such a warning as it approaches the crossing. Haaga II, 169 Wash, at 553-54.\nHaving reached this conclusion, I would not address whether the instruction violates Brush\u2019s right to have each element against him proved by the State beyond a reasonable doubt or Brush\u2019s right to have a jury decide each element of the offense. If the instruction did violate either of those rights, we would be facing a far more serious error than a comment on the evidence because relieving the State of its burden to prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt violates the defendant\u2019s fundamental due process rights, see In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970), and removing an element from the jury\u2019s consideration violates a defendant\u2019s fundamental right to a jury trial under article I, section 22 of our constitution, State v. Ring, 52 Wn.2d 423, 424, 325 P.2d 730 (1958). Such violations would trigger the constitutional harmlessness standard, which is far more stringent than the standard of review used for article IV, section 16 violations. Consequently, treating such errors as comments on the evidence is not merely incorrect under our article IV, section 16 jurisprudence, it actually trivializes the nature of such errors.\nDrawing such an inference from the Woods quote would constitute the exact same error \u2014 denying the antecedent \u2014 that the majority correctly perceives in the disputed WPIC. See majority at 558 (\u201c[Barnett] held only that two weeks was not legally sufficient to be a \u2018prolonged period of time\u2019 \u2014 not that abuse occurring longer than two weeks would be legally sufficient.\u201d). Under the rules of formal logic, conditional statements take the form, \u201cIf P, then Q.\u201d P is termed the antecedent and Q the consequent. The fallacy of denying the antecedent occurs when one takes a true statement presented in this form and concludes that \u201cif not P, then not Q\u201d must also be true. That conclusion is not valid because negating the truth of the antecedent (i.e., denying the truth of P) does not necessitate the denial of its consequent. Thus, one cannot infer that \u201clegally inaccurate instructions are comments on the evidence\u201d from the principle that \u201clegally accurate instructions are not comments on the evidence.\u201d See Agri Processor Co. v. Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd., 379 U.S. App. D.C. 318, 514 F.3d 1, 6 (2008) (citing Patrick J. Hurley, A Concise Introduction to Logic 323 (9th ed. 2005)). Consider the following argument, which uses \u201csnowing\u201d as the antecedent and \u201ccold\u201d as the consequent: \u201cPremise 1: If it is snowing, then it is cold outside. Premise 2: It is not snowing. Conclusion: It is not cold outside.\u201d Plainly, the latter conclusion does not follow from its premise; it can be cold without snow falling, even though snowfall requires a cold outside temperature.\nAnother example would be if a court instructed the jury that it may find the defendant guilty if it finds each element proved by a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. Such an instruction would violate a defendant\u2019s fundamental due process rights, see In re Winship, 397 U.S. at 364, but it could not plausibly be deemed a comment on the evidence.",

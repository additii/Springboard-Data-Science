        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b61 TC, a child, took a loaded gun from the home where his mother lived with her boyfriend, Douglas Bauer. The gun belonged to Bauer. TC brought that loaded gun to school in his backpack a few days after he stole it. The gun discharged as TC was rummaging in his pack at the end of the day. The bullet struck TC\u2019s classmate, and it seriously injured her.\n\u00b62 The State charged Bauer with assault in the third degree, alleging that he, \u201c[w]ith criminal negligence, cause [d] bodily harm to another person by means of a weapon or other instrument or thing likely to produce bodily harm.\u201d RCW 9A.36.031(1)(d). Bauer moved to dismiss pretrial under State v. Knapstad, arguing that the facts did not support a third degree assault charge as a matter of law. The State argued that the statutory phrase \u201ccauses bodily harm\u201d reached Bauer\u2019s conduct as a primary \u201ccause\u201d of the harm to TC\u2019s classmate. The trial court agreed with the State and denied the motion to dismiss but then certified the matter to the Court of Appeals. In a split decision, the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling. State v. Bauer, 174 Wn. App. 59, 295 P.3d 1227 (2013). We now reverse the Court of Appeals.\nFACTS\n\u00b63 On February 22,2012, at about 1:30 p.m., the children at Armin Jahr Elementary School in Bremerton, Washington, were getting ready to go home for the day. As the teacher prepared to lead the children from the classroom to the school bus, she heard a loud pop. Looking around, the teacher saw one child bent over with blood on her hands. She summoned other staff, and before long they realized that the bloodied child had been shot.\n\u00b64 A staff member noticed a backpack on TC\u2019s desk. It contained a gun. The backpack was identified as TC\u2019s backpack, and after the police arrived, TC was transported to a Youth Services Center for booking. Police later concluded that the gun, a Heckler & Koch .45 caliber pistol, had discharged \u201cwhile still inside the backpack.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 86.\n\u00b65 Police interviewed TC several times. TC explained that he had been visiting his mother and her boyfriend, Bauer, in their home for the past three years, since he was six years old. He asserted that ever since he had first visited, he had seen multiple guns accessible throughout the house. TC said that his mother and Bauer told him the guns were all loaded. According to TC, the weekend before the shooting, as he was leaving Bauer\u2019s house, he saw a gun on a bedroom dresser and \u201cswiped the gun into his backpack.\u201d CP at 116. TC explained that he took the gun because some classmates had \u201ctold him they were going to have teenagers come and beat him up.\u201d Id. He asserted that the shooting was accidental. TC pleaded guilty in juvenile court to reckless endangerment and was sentenced to probation and counseling.\n\u00b66 Police also interviewed TC\u2019s mother and Bauer, along with TC\u2019s siblings. Their statements corroborate TC\u2019s statements that there were multiple unsecured and loaded guns around the house.\n\u00b67 The State charged Bauer with assault in the third degree under the deadly weapon prong. That portion of the assault statute states that a person is guilty of third degree assault who, \u201c[w]ith criminal negligence, causes bodily harm to another person by means of a weapon or other instrument or thing likely to produce bodily harm.\u201d RCW 9A.36.031(1)(d). The State also charged Bauer with TC\u2019s unlawful possession of a firearm, relying on the complicity statute, which states in relevant part that a person is liable for the criminal conduct of another if, \u201c[a]cting with the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of the crime, he or she causes an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in such conduct.\u201d RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a). Bauer moved to dismiss both charges under Knapstad. He also moved to dismiss the charges on vagueness grounds.\n\u00b68 The trial court granted the motion to dismiss the unlawful possession of a firearm charge, and the State did not appeal that decision. CP at 139. The trial court also denied the motions to dismiss the third degree assault charge. Id. However, the trial judge recognized that this ruling \u201cinvolves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for a difference of opinion\u201d and certified the questions to the Court of Appeals. CP at 142.\n\u00b69 The Court of Appeals affirmed in a split decision. Bauer, 174 Wn. App. 59. Two judges concluded that the word \u201ccauses\u201d in the third degree assault statute was sufficiently flexible to present a jury question on whether Bauer \u201ccaused\u201d the injury to TC\u2019s classmate by leaving a loaded gun where TC could access it. Id. at 69-70. The two-member majority also held that the facts of the case did not preclude the State from seeking to convict Bauer under the complicity statute, RCW 9A.08.020. Id. at 77. The majority rejected Bauer\u2019s vagueness argument. Id. at 80-81.\n\u00b610 Bauer sought discretionary review by this court, and we granted it. State v. Bauer, 177 Wn.2d 1019, 304 P.3d 115 (2013). We hold that the third degree assault statute does not apply to Bauer\u2019s conduct. We further hold that the complicity statute does not expand the assault statute\u2019s reach to Bauer\u2019s conduct. Because we resolve the case on those grounds, we do not reach Bauer\u2019s vagueness challenge.\nANALYSIS\nA. Knapstad Motion\ni. Standard of Review\n\u00b611 Under Knapstad, a defendant may move to dismiss a criminal charge on the ground that there are no disputed material facts and the undisputed facts do not establish a prima facie case of guilt as a matter of law. Knapstad, 107 Wn.2d at 356-57. We review a trial court\u2019s decision on a Knapstad motion de novo. See State v. Montano, 169 Wn.2d 872, 876, 239 P.3d 360 (2010) (citing State v. Conte, 159 Wn.2d 797, 803, 154 P.3d 194 (2007)).\nii. Causation in Criminal Law Is Different from Causation in Tort\n\u00b612 In this case, resolution of the Knapstad motion turns on statutory interpretation \u2014 primarily, the meaning of the word \u201ccauses\u201d in the third degree assault statute. RCW 9A.36.031(1)(d). The legislature has provided the following rule for interpreting such criminal statutes: \u201c[t]he provisions of the common law relating to the commission of crime and the punishment thereof, insofar as not inconsistent with the Constitution and statutes of this state, shall supplement all penal statutes of this state . . . .\u201d RCW 9A.04.060. The assault statute does not define the term \u201ccause.\u201d We therefore turn to \u201cthe common law relating to the commission of crime and the punishment thereof\u201d to supplement that provision. Id.\n\u00b613 Our court has ruled that \u201c[b]efore criminal liability is imposed, the conduct of the defendant must be both (1) the actual cause, and (2) the \u2018legal\u2019 or \u2018proximate\u2019 cause of the result.\u201d State v. Rivas, 126 Wn.2d 443, 453, 896 P.2d 57 (1995) (quoting 1 Wayne R. LaFave & Austin W. Scott, Jr., Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 3.12, at 392 (1986)).\n\u00b614 \u201c \u2018Cause in fact refers to the \u201cbut for\u201d consequences of an act \u2014 the physical connection between an act and an injury.\u2019 \u201d State v. Dennison, 115 Wn.2d 609, 624, 801 P.2d 193 (1990) (quoting Hartley v. State, 103 Wn.2d 768, 778, 698 P.2d 77 (1985)). Legal causation, on the other hand,\ninvolves a determination of whether liability should attach as a matter of law given the existence of cause in fact. If the factual elements of the tort are proved, determination of legal liability will be dependent on \u201cmixed considerations of logic, common sense, justice, policy, and precedent.\u201d\nHartley, 103 Wn.2d at 779 (quoting King v. City of Seattle, 84 Wn.2d 239, 250, 525 P.2d 228 (1974) (citing 1 Thomas Atkins Street, Foundations of Legal Liability 100, 110 (1906))).\n\u00b615 This court, in agreement with commentators and other jurisdictions, has observed that \u201cas to cause in fact, tort and criminal situations are exactly alike.\u201d Dennison, 115 Wn.2d at 624 n.15 (citing 1 LaFave & Scott, supra, at 397 n.31).\n\u00b616 Legal causation, however, is different. Commentators and courts recognize that criminal law and tort law serve different purposes and therefore have different principles of legal causation. \u201c[W]ith crimes, where the consequences of a determination of guilt are more drastic ... it is arguable that a closer relationship between the result achieved and that intended or hazarded should be required.\u201d 1 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 6.4(c) at 472 (2d ed. 2003). \u201cThe wider doctrines of causation currently applied in tort law should not be extended to criminal law. . . . [I]n criminal law, ... it is not normally enough merely to prove that [the] accused occasioned the harm; he must have \u2018caused\u2019 it in the strict sense.\u201d H.L.A. Hart & Tony Honor\u00e9, Causation in the Law 350-51 (2d ed. 1985); see also Jerome Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 254-55 (2d ed. 1960) (noting that causation in tort may be much broader than causation in criminal law).\n\u00b617 Most states that have addressed the question agree that legal causation is defined more narrowly in criminal law than it is in tort law. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court explained, in the context of felony murder:\nA closer causal connection between the felony and the killing than the proximate-cause[] theory normally applicable to tort cases should be required because of the extreme penalty attaching to a conviction for felony murder and the difference between the underlying rationales of criminal and tort law. The former is intended to impose punishment in appropriate cases while the latter is primarily concerned with who shall bear the burden of a loss.\nCommonwealth ex rel. Smith v. Myers, 438 Pa. 218, 232, 261 A.2d 550 (1970). Cases from multiple jurisdictions, both state and federal, support this principle. E.g., United States v. Schmidt, 626 F.2d 616, 618 n.3 (8th Cir. 1980) (\u201c[W]e believe that proof of some more direct causal connection between act and result should be required in criminal cases than would be sufficient to uphold liability in tort.\u201d); Campbell v. State, 293 Md. 438, 450-51, 444 A.2d 1034 (1982) (\u201c[T]he tort liability concept of proximate cause is generally too broad and comprehensive to be appropriate in a criminal proceeding ....\u201d); People v. Kibbe, 35 N.Y.2d 407, 413, 321 N.E.2d 773, 362 N.Y.S.2d 848 (1974) (\u201cWe subscribe to the requirement that the defendants\u2019 actions must be a sufficiently direct cause of the ensuing death before there can be any imposition of criminal liability, and recognize, of course, that this standard is greater than that required to serve as a basis for tort liability.\u201d); People v. Scott, 29 Mich. App. 549, 558, 185 N.W.2d 576 (1971) (\u201cIn criminal prosecutions there must be a more direct causal connection between the criminal conduct of the defendant and the homicide charged than is required by the tort liability concept of proximate cause.\u201d).\n\u00b618 This court has never explicitly addressed whether \u201clegal cause\u201d is the same in both tort and criminal law. But a comparison of Washington criminal and tort cases shows that liability tends to extend further in tort cases. For example, in Schooley v. Pinch\u2019s Deli Market, Inc., we held that, as a matter of policy, a vendor who sells alcohol to a minor may be the legal cause of injuries to a second minor who obtained the alcohol purchased by the first minor. 134 Wn.2d 468, 480, 951 P.2d 749 (1998). In Bronk v. Davenny, we held that liability could extend to a defendant who left a tractor operational and unguarded on his property, which tractor was stolen by children who used it to cause damage to the plaintiff\u2019s property. 25 Wn.2d 443, 171 P.2d 237 (1946). And in Parrilla v. King County, a county bus driver left his bus with the engine running while there was a single passenger on board who was behaving in an obviously erratic manner. 138 Wn. App. 427, 430-31, 157 P.3d 879 (2007). The passenger then got in the driver\u2019s seat and crashed the bus, causing injuries. Id. at 431. The Court of Appeals concluded that under those circumstances the county was not shielded from liability. Id. at 441.\n\u00b619 No appellate criminal case in Washington has found legal causation based on negligent acts similar to those in the civil cases above that were incapable of causing injury directly. This is apparent in the facts of the cases cited by the State in support of its argument that it may charge Bauer with third degree assault. For example, in State v. Leech, this court held that an arsonist \u201ccaused\u201d the death of a firefighter who responded to the arson fire, despite the fact that the firefighter may have been negligent in his firefighting. 114 Wn.2d 700, 705, 790 P.2d 160 (1990). The arsonist, however, intentionally started the fire \u2014 clearly an intentional criminal act capable of causing harm in and of itself. In State v. Perez-Cervantes, we held that a person who stabs another may be liable for the other\u2019s death even if drug abuse also contributed to the death. 141 Wn.2d 468, 6 P.3d 1160 (2000). In contrast to this case, that defendant performed an intentional criminal act \u2014 stabbing\u2014that directly caused harm. And in State v. Christman, the Court of Appeals applied causation principles to determine that a person who gives illicit drugs to another may be liable for the other\u2019s death from overdose even if other drugs from another source also contributed to the death. 160 Wn. App. 741, 249 P.3d 680 (2011). Once again, the initial act was not only intentional, but felonious, and capable of causing harm in and of itself.\n\u00b620 Bauer\u2019s act of gun ownership, in contrast, is not felonious or criminal. His decision to keep loaded weapons around the house is not, in itself, a crime in this state, either. The most analogous criminal case that we have found is from Iowa: State v. Ayers, 478 N.W.2d 606 (Iowa 1991). In that case, Ayers was a firearm vendor convicted of involuntary manslaughter for selling a gun to a minor. Id. at 607. The minor accidentally shot and killed his girlfriend a few days later. Id. The court held, \u201cMore is required than appears here to support a showing of proximate cause in a manslaughter case. The missing ingredient is a more direct connection between Ayers and the act which killed the young victim.\u201d Id. at 608.\n\u00b621 Neither party has identified a Washington case upholding criminal liability on facts like the ones on which the Bauer prosecution is based. This court has found no Washington case upholding such liability, either, where the accused did not actively participate in the immediate physical impetus of harm. Cf. Hart & Honor\u00e9, supra, at 326 (\u201c[W]here [the first actor\u2019s] conduct was not sufficient [to bring about the harm] without the intervention of the second actor . . . most decisions relieve the first actor of responsibility.\u201d).\n\u00b622 In light of the scholarly literature, our case law, and case law from foreign jurisdictions, we hold that \u201clegal cause\u201d in criminal cases differs from, and is narrower than, \u201clegal cause\u201d in tort cases in Washington.\nHi. Liability Does Not Attach to Bauer in This Case\n\u00b623 As discussed above, there is no criminal case in Washington upholding criminal liability based on a negligent act that has such intervening facts as in this case between the original negligence and the final, specific, injurious result. More tellingly, even in analogous civil cases, we have declined to extend liability so far.\n\u00b624 For example, in Sailor v. Ohlde, this court addressed whether \u201cthe owner of an automobile who leaves the key in the ignition switch [can be civilly] liable for injury or damage caused by a stranger who enters upon private property and steals the automobile.\u201d 71 Wn.2d 646, 647, 430 P.2d 591 (1967). We answered the question no. Id.\n\u00b625 In Pratt v. Thomas, we reached the same conclusion regarding an accident involving a car stolen from a public parking lot. 80 Wn.2d 117, 118, 491 P.2d 1285 (1971). Characterizing the question as one of \u201cproximate cause,\u201d we held:\nHere it is plain the accident which caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries was not a part of the natural and continuous sequence of events which flowed from respondents\u2019 act in leaving their station wagon in the parking lot. It was the result of new and independent forces. Among the new forces were the stealing of the vehicle, the pursuit by the state patrol, the attempt by the thieves to run from the officers and, finally, the accident.\nId. at 119. We acknowledge that this summary could be characterized as addressing cause in fact, legal cause, or both. The court did not distinguish between the two, and we had not yet decided Hartley, which clarified the two different kinds of causation. Still, this court found that \u201cproximate cause\u201d was lacking. Id.\n\u00b626 Likewise, in Kim v. Budget Rent A Car Systems, Inc., we held that causation was lacking where a car rental company left a car unlocked in its parking lot with keys in the ignition, the car was stolen, and the thief caused injuries in an accident the following day. 143 Wn.2d 190, 15 P.3d 1283 (2001). We stated that \u201c[a]t a minimum, the remoteness in time between the criminal act and the injury is dispositive to the question of legal cause in this cas e\u201d Id. at 205. We explained that \u201c[e]ven if it were negligent for Budget to leave the keys inside of its minivan, \u2018the responsibility for such negligence must terminate at some time in the future....\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Gmerek v. Rachlin, 390 So. 2d 1230, 1231 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1980)). We therefore concluded that legal cause was lacking because \u2018Young went home, went to sleep, and became intoxicated before criminally causing the accident injuring plaintiff the day after the theft.\u201d Id. In addition, we noted that where other jurisdictions had found liability, \u201cmost have not involved the type of attenuated facts present here.\u201d Id.\n\u00b627 Finally, the Washington tort case most closely analogous to the one at hand, McGrane v. Cline, also supports our holding that Bauer is not liable for third degree assault in this case. 94 Wn. App. 925, 973 P.2d 1092 (1999). In McGrane, a teenage daughter took the parents\u2019 firearm from their home and gave it to a friend; the friend used it to commit a robbery, and he fatally shot a third person during that crime. Id. at 926-27. The Court of Appeals ruled that the parents were not civilly liable for that result. Id. at 928-29. Although that case was decided on grounds of duty, there is a well-recognized \u201cinterrelationship between questions of duty and legal cause.\u201d Lowman v. Wilbur, 178 Wn.2d 165, 169, 309 P.3d 387 (2013).\n\u00b628 Just as in McGrane, the firearm here was taken, without the owner\u2019s permission or knowledge, by a minor child and later used to cause serious harm. Similar to Kim, two days passed between TC taking the gun from Bauer on Monday afternoon and the shooting at school on Wednesday afternoon. McGrane, Kim, and their companion cases Sailor and Pratt are civil cases, not criminal cases. No criminal case in Washington has found liability on such attenuated facts as those in this case. Because legal causation in civil cases is broader and more flexible than it is in criminal cases, these civil cases compel the conclusion that legal causation is not satisfied as to Bauer in this case.\nB. Criminal Liability for Acts of a Third Party\n\u00b629 Bauer asserts that where injury is caused by a third party, the State may charge a person other than that third party with a crime only under the complicity statute and that the complicity statute does not reach Bauer\u2019s conduct. See RCW 9A.08.020 (\u201cLiability for conduct of another\u2014 Complicity\u201d (boldface omitted)). The State responds that it is not charging Bauer for another\u2019s conduct, it is charging him with his own conduct \u2014 leaving loaded guns around with children present. The Court of Appeals found that the State could rely on both principal and complicity liability. Bauer, 174 Wn. App. at 76-77.\n\u00b630 We need not decide whether the State can ever charge a person, as a principal, for harm that is the immediate result of a third party\u2019s actions. As discussed supra Part A.iii, immediately above, the State cannot do so on the facts of this case.\n\u00b631 As to the second point \u2014 whether complicity liability is available in this case \u2014 the Court of Appeals is mistaken. Under the undisputed facts of this case, the State cannot rely on the complicity statute.\n\u00b632 The complicity statute establishes vicarious criminal liability in three situations: accomplice liability (RCW 9A.08.020(2)(c)), when a criminal statute itself expressly provides for vicarious liability (RCW 9A.08.020(2)(b)), and by \u201ccausing] \u201d an innocent person to do the illegal act (RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a)). The Court of Appeals first noted, correctly, that the State could not rely on accomplice liability under the subsection (2)(c) prong. For accomplice liability to attach, the defendant must have knowledge that his actions will \u201c \u2018promote or facilitate\u2019 \u201d the commission of \u201c \u2018the\u2019 \u201d particular crime at issue. State v. Stein, 144 Wn.2d 236, 245, 27 P.3d 184 (2001) (quoting RCW 9A.08.020(3)(a)). Because there is no evidence of such knowledge in this case, the Court of Appeals held, the State could not seek to convict Bauer as an accomplice. We agree.\n\u00b633 The Court of Appeals did not separately discuss vicarious liability under prong (2)(b). That was appropriate. Prong (2)(b) seems to refer the reader back to the language of the statute defining the substantive crime, which, in this case, we have already analyzed, above.\n\u00b634 The Court of Appeals concluded, however, that the State could seek to convict Bauer under the \u201cinnocent or irresponsible person\u201d prong of the complicity statute, that is, RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a). Bauer, 174 Wn. App. at 77. Under that prong, a person is guilty of a crime if it is committed by the conduct of another when, \u201c[a]cting with the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of the crime, he or she causes an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in such conduct.\u201d RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a) (emphasis added). Prong (2)(a) does not require intent, only \u201cculpability that is sufficient for the commission of the crime.\u201d Id. Since a third degree assault charge requires only a culpability of criminal negligence, the Court of Appeals reasoned that Bauer could be liable for TC\u2019s conduct if he caused that conduct:\nHere, the State . . . has produced evidence that would support a jury\u2019s determination that Bauer caused TC\u2019s conduct. While it is not clear that the State will seek to instruct the jury under this section in this case, the facts of the case at this stage do not preclude it from doing so.\nBauer, 174 Wn. App. at 77. It is not completely clear to what evidence of causation the Court of Appeals is referring, but it appears to mean the evidence that Bauer left guns lying around.\n\u00b635 The Court of Appeals\u2019s reasoning fails to take account of two things. First, RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a) requires proof that the defendant acted with the same mens rea as that required for \u201cthe crime.\u201d We have previously interpreted the words \u201cthe crime\u201d in other subsections of the complicity statute very narrowly. We have said that \u201cthe crime\u201d means intent to promote the crime that was actually charged, not just any crime. State v. Cronin, 142 Wn.2d 568, 579, 14 P.3d 752 (2000); State v. Roberts, 142 Wn.2d 471, 510-11, 14 P.3d 713 (2000). Using that same narrow interpretation here, we find evidence of such mens rea was lacking. Bauer may have been negligent about leaving loaded guns out in the presence of children. TC may have been negligent about enabling a gun enclosed in a backpack to discharge. Bauer\u2019s negligence was thus not the same as the culpability required for \u201cthe crime\u201d; it might have been equally negligent, but not as to the same act, result, and balancing of costs and benefits. Any negligence on Bauer\u2019s part thus does not meet the definition of culpability for \u201cthe crime\u201d required by RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a). Since any negligence on his part was not \u201cculpability . . . sufficient for the commission of the crime,\u201d RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a), Bauer cannot be liable under prong (2)(a).\n\u00b636 Second, there is a difference between \u201ccausing]\u201d a particular result and \u201ccausing] \u201d another actor to engage in conduct \u2014 and the latter is what RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a) requires. State v. Chester, a case much cited by Bauer, illustrates this distinction. 133 Wn.2d 15, 940 P.2d 1374 (1997). There, we analyzed the meaning of \u201ccause\u201d in a different statute, RCW 9.68A.040(1)(b), that criminalizes \u201ccausing] a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct.\u201d We held that to \u201ccause\u201d a child to engage in sexually explicit behavior \u201crequires some affirmative act of assistance, interaction, influence or communication on the part of a defendant which initiates and results in a child\u2019s display of sexually explicit conduct.\u201d Chester, 133 Wn.2d at 22. The legislature probably intended \u201ccause\u201d to mean the same thing in the statute at issue here, RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a), that criminalizes \u201ccaus[ing] an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in [illegal] conduct.\u201d But there is no evidence of any such interaction here that would permit a finding that Bauer \u201ccaused\u201d TC to take a gun to school. See id.; Hart & Honor\u00e9, supra, at 363-64, 368 (discussing the significant difference between causing a result and causing another actor to engage in behavior); see also Hart & Honor\u00e9, supra, at 367 (\u201c \u2018causing\u2019 a person to act refers to a species of the genus \u2018inducing\u2019 or \u2018instigating\u2019 \u201d).\n\u00b637 We hold that the Court of Appeals erred in determining that Bauer could be liable under RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a).\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b638 The legislature defined the crime of third degree assault to reach a person who, \u201c[w]ith criminal negligence, causes bodily harm to another person by means of a weapon or other instrument or thing likely to produce bodily harm.\u201d RCW 9A.36.031(l)(d). Bauer asserts that the State has failed to make a prima facie case that his conduct of leaving guns around his house loaded and accessible to invited children \u201ccaused\u201d the bodily harm here. We agree. Although causation in fact is the same in criminal and civil cases, legal causation is not. Our case law suggests that legal causation does not extend as far in criminal cases as it does in tort cases, and even our civil cases do not extend liability as far as the State seeks to do in this case. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.\nMadsen, C.J.; C. Johnson, Owens, and Wiggins, JJ.; and J.M. Johnson, J. Pro Tem., concur.\nBauer is not related to TC and is not TC\u2019s guardian. TC does not live with his mother and Bauer, but visits.\n107 Wn.2d 346, 356, 729 P.2d 48 (1986).\nBauer\u2019s Knapstad motion to dismiss was based on the factual summary provided in defense counsel\u2019s affidavit attached to the motion. That factual summary was based on \u201ca review of the police reports, discovery and other material received thus far from the Kitsap County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\u201d CP at 49. The State does not dispute the version of the facts set forth in the Knapstad motion.\nA defendant is entitled to dismissal of charges pretrial if \u201cthere are no material disputed facts and the undisputed facts do not establish a prima facie case of guilt.\u201d Knapstad, 107 Wn.2d at 356.\nWashington recognizes two elements of causation: cause in fact (sometimes called \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cbut for\u201d cause) and legal cause (sometimes called \u201cproximate\u201d cause). Hartley v. State, 103 Wn.2d 768, 777-79, 698 P.2d 77 (1985) (citing Harbeson v. Parke-Davis, Inc., 98 Wn.2d 460, 475, 656 P.2d 483 (1983)). In Washington, unlike other jurisdictions, we call both of these elements together \u201cproximate cause.\u201d Id. at 777. Note, however, that in Rivas, we used the phrase \u201clegal cause\u201d to mean the same thing as \u201cproximate cause.\u201d Rivas, 126 Wn.2d at 453. In context, we did not mean \u201ccause in fact,\u201d but the other type of causation. To be clear, this opinion will refer to the two different types of causation as \u201clegal cause\u201d and \u201ccause in fact\u201d unless otherwise noted.\nNote that this case discusses legal causation in the civil, not criminal, context.\nSome scholars hold contrasting views. See, e.g., Hall, supra, at 294-95 (describing Justice Holmes\u2019s view that identical policies underlie both tort and criminal law).\nNote that most jurisdictions use the term \u201cproximate cause\u201d to mean something similar to what we call \u201clegal cause,\u201d whereas in Washington, \u201cproximate cause\u201d means both \u201ccause in fact\u201d and \u201clegal cause\u201d together.\nFor example, the language \u201cnatural and continuous sequence of events which flowed from the act\u201d is similar to language often associated with legal, rather than factual, causation. E.g., 1 Charles E. Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 26, at 147-48 (15th ed. 1993). But the language regarding \u201cnew and independent forces\u201d is, under Washington case law, a part of the factual inquiry. See Lowman v. Wilbur, 178 Wn.2d 165, 172, 309 P.3d 387 (2013).\nThe State has represented to this court in its supplemental briefing that \u201cthe State is not arguing that Bauer should be held responsible for the actions of another pursuant to RCW 9A.08.0[2]0.\u201d Suppl. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 19. But it does not need to charge accomplice liability to seek an accomplice liability instruction, and the Court of Appeals addressed the availability of such an instruction. Bauer, 174 Wn. App. at 77.\nThe trial court dismissed the State\u2019s charge of unlawful possession of a firearm, the State did not appeal that decision, and it is therefore not before us. We note, however, that \u201cknowing possession\u201d is an essential element of the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm. State v. Anderson, 141 Wn.2d 357, 366, 5 P.3d 1247 (2000). Thus it seems likely that even if the charge had not been dismissed, the State would not have been able to show that Bauer was liable for TC\u2019s possession of a firearm under the complicity statute.\nThe Court of Appeals did not address whether TC was an \u201cinnocent or irresponsible\u201d person; since the record is insufficient for us to make that determination, we do not address it either. Bauer notes, however, that TC did plead guilty to criminal reckless endangerment in a separate case, which has a mens rea of recklessness, not innocence.",

        "text": "Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\n\u00b639 (dissenting) \u2014 Douglas Bauer kept multiple loaded guns unsecured throughout his house. These weapons were easily accessible to his girlfriend\u2019s minor children, including TC, a nine-year-old boy who frequently visited and sometimes stayed the night. Unsupervised, TC put one of Bauer\u2019s handguns into his backpack. Two days later, that gun, still in TC\u2019s backpack, discharged in a classroom, seriously injuring one of TC\u2019s classmates. Bauer did not notice his handgun was missing until after the shooting. The majority believes that because nine-year-old TC did not have permission to take the weapon and because two days elapsed between the taking and the subsequent shooting, Bauer\u2019s carelessness could not, as a matter of law, be the cause of the victim\u2019s serious injury. See majority at 942, 946. I disagree. The delay in Bauer noticing that his gun was missing is itself evidence of his negligence. Though a jury may well find Bauer\u2019s actions to be too attenuated from the victim\u2019s injury to impose criminal liability as a matter of fact, whether criminal liability can attach as a matter of law is a policy question for the legislature. The legislature has made this policy judgment in RCW 9A.36.031(l)(d). It is neither unreasonable nor unwise to allow a jury to decide if it was the firearm owner\u2019s criminal negligence that caused the handgun to be brought to school, to be accidentally discharged, and to seriously injure the young victim. Since the majority believes otherwise, I respectfully dissent.\n\u00b640 The issue before us is a novel one. As the majority notes, no Washington appellate court has weighed in on the lawful extent of legal cause in the context of the third degree assault statute. Id. at 938-40. But that \u201c[t]his court has found no Washington case upholding . . . liability . . . where the accused did not actively participate in the immediate physical impetus of harm\u201d is not a compelling argument against whether the legislature intended to criminalize this sort of carelessness. Id. at 940. It is well settled that legal causation \u201crests on policy considerations as to how far the consequences of defendant\u2019s acts should extend. It involves a determination of whether liability should attach as a matter of law given the existence of cause in fact.\u201d Hartley v. State, 103 Wn.2d 768, 779, 698 P.2d 77 (1985). In the context of criminal law, that question is for the legislature, and it has answered it.\n\u00b641 Given scientific research on the topic, it is clear the legislative purpose of RCW 9A.36.031(1)(d) would be best served by letting a jury decide whether a firearm owner is liable for an unintended shooting that is the result of a young child picking up a carelessly stored handgun. In one study, scientists monitored numerous small groups of 8- to 12-year-old boys in a room that had two water pistols concealed in one drawer and an actual handgun concealed in another. Geoffrey A. Jackman et al., Seeing Is Believing: What Do Boys Do When They Find a Real Gun?, 107 Pediatrics 1247, 1247-48 (2001). The researchers limited the study to boys in this age range because they are \u201ca high-risk group for unintentional firearm injury.\u201d Id. at 1248. The scientists found that 75 percent of the boys found the handgun within 15 minutes, 63 percent of these boys handled it, and 33 percent of them actually pulled the trigger enough to discharge the weapon. Id. Overall, the \u201cresults suggest that 8- to 12-year-old boys cannot be trusted to refrain from handling a handgun if they encounter one outside the immediate supervision of an adult.\u201d Id. at 1250.\n\u00b642 A different study, which measured the association of household firearm storage practices and the risk of unintentional and self-inflicted injuries associated with child or adolescent access to firearms in the home, also supports the conclusion that we should not preclude liability on legal causation grounds. See David C. Grossman et al., Gun Storage Practices and Risk of Youth Suicide and Unintentional Firearm Injuries, 293 JAMA 707, 708-10 (2005). There, researchers found that \u201cstoring household guns as locked, unloaded, or separate from the ammunition [was] associated with significant reductions in the risk of unintentional and self-inflicted firearm injuries and deaths among adolescents and children.\u201d Id. at 714. In other words, and not surprisingly, this survey revealed that guns that were kept loaded, unsecured, and accessible to children were involved in accidents far more frequently than those that were not. Id.\n\u00b643 Given both science and common sense, I find the legislature\u2019s inclusion of criminal negligence as a proper basis for an assault charge as permitting a jury to determine a handgun owner\u2019s liability in situations such as this. The jury would be able to consider all of the relevant circumstances, including the age and maturity of the child, the child\u2019s familiarity with firearms, and the precautions the firearm owner took or did not take, to determine if the firearm owner\u2019s conduct amounts to criminal negligence. What the majority believes to be the intervening actions and attenuating circumstances in this case are the natural and foreseeable consequences of the very danger that Bauer\u2019s careless actions created.\n\u00b644 TC\u2019s picking up the handgun and Bauer\u2019s failure to notice are not intervening causes in the ultimate injury. Like the majority, I do not believe \u201cBauer\u2019s act of gun ownership\u201d or \u201c[h]is decision to keep loaded weapons around the house\u201d is in itself criminal. See majority at 939. But it need not be. Third degree assault predicated on criminal negligence does not require an underlying illegal act or an intentional act but merely criminal negligence that results in bodily harm. RCW 9A.36.031(1)(d). By its plain language, the purpose of the statute is to impose liability when injury is caused by criminal negligence, not criminal intent or felonious action. Id. A defendant can face liability for criminal negligence \u201cwhen he or she fails to be aware of a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and his or her failure to be aware of such substantial risk constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation.\u201d RCW 9A.08.010(l)(d). TC\u2019s actions are not distinct from Bauer\u2019s carelessness for legal causation purposes. When Bauer\u2019s gun ownership and method of storage is combined with the known presence of an unsupervised nine-year-old boy, especially when coupled with a failure to notice the unsecured weapon was missing, a jury, not a judge, should decide if this created a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur.\n\u00b645 Finding that TC\u2019s taking the gun without Bauer\u2019s permission was an intervening action, as the majority does, tacitly shifts the ultimate responsibility for the victim\u2019s injury to a nine-year-old child. Not only do I find this troubling in light of behavioral science, but also I agree with the legislature that \u201c[c]hildren of eight and under twelve years of age are presumed to be incapable of committing crime.\u201d RCW 9A.04.050. Though this presumption may be removed, see id., and I do not seek to address the appropriateness of the liability imposed on TC, it is unsettling that TC, as a matter of law, will face more criminal culpability in this situation than Bauer.\n\u00b646 At its core, this case comes down to considerations of sound policy. Bauer kept a loaded, unsecured handgun in a room that an unsupervised nine-year-old boy could access freely. Bauer also did not notice that this loaded weapon had been taken for two days as TC toted it in his backpack to and from school. Given that both science and common sense strongly suggest that Bauer was in the best position to prevent the injury to TC\u2019s classmate and that his conduct was its primary cause, I would not preclude Bauer\u2019s liability on legal causation grounds and would allow a jury to resolve the matter.\n\u00b647 With these observations, I respectfully dissent.\nFairhurst and Stephens, JJ., concur with Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\nHttp://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/107/6/1247.full.pdf (subscription required).\nHttp://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/4963/JOC32162.pdf.",

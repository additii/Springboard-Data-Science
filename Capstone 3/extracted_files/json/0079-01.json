        "text": "Yu, J.\n\u00b6 1 Petitioner John Charles Anderson returns to this court a second time asking that we reverse his civil commitment under chapter 71.09 RCW. Specifically, he asks whether juvenile adjudication for a sexually violent offense is a predicate \u201cconvict[ion]\u201d under the applicable statutory provision, RCW 71.09.030(l)(e). We hold it is. We also reject his other challenges and therefore affirm his civil commitment.\nBACKGROUND\n\u00b62 In 1988, when Anderson was 17 years old, he pleaded guilty in juvenile court to statutory rape in the first degree. The victim was two and a half years old. Anderson was sentenced to 100 weeks in a juvenile rehabilitation facility. Anderson has since disclosed numerous uncharged juvenile sex offenses predating his guilty plea, including other rapes.\n\u00b63 When Anderson\u2019s juvenile sentence was about to expire in 1990, the State petitioned to have him involuntarily committed and he was transferred to Western State Hospital (WSH) for an evaluation. Before the evaluation period ended, Anderson voluntarily sought civil commitment. Anderson remained at WSH as a voluntary patient for approximately 10 years. In 1998, Anderson requested to be transferred to a less restrictive area of WSH. This less restrictive area was intended for residents who \u201cwere managing their own lives and had the wherewithal to take care of themselves,\u201d and residents who were transferred to the less restrictive area were often later released into the community. 9 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (May 9, 2013) at 690. However, the psychosexual evaluator determined that Anderson \u201cwas really not controlling his sexual impulses to the degree that he claimed he had been,\u201d and recommended against transferring him to the less restrictive area. Id. at 699.\n\u00b64 In February 2000, Anderson announced his intention to end his voluntary commitment and the State petitioned to have him involuntarily committed as a sexually violent predator (SVP) pursuant to chapter 71.09 RCW. Anderson was transferred to the Special Commitment Center (SCC) during the pendency of the State\u2019s petition in March 2001.\n\u00b65 The State\u2019s petition alleged that Anderson was \u201ca person who at any time previously has been convicted of a sexually violent offense and has since been released from total confinement and has committed a recent overt act.\u201d RCW 71.09.030(l)(e). The predicate conviction the State relied on was Anderson\u2019s 1988 juvenile court adjudication for first degree statutory rape, and the \u201crecent overt acts\u201d it relied on were sexual contacts Anderson had with four other patients while at WSH. Three of those patients had been diagnosed with developmental disabilities, and the fourth had been diagnosed with severe borderline personality disorder. In 2004, after a bench trial, the trial court found Anderson was an SVP.\n\u00b66 The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to appoint Anderson\u2019s requested expert witness. In re Det. of Anderson, 134 Wn. App. 309, 321, 139 P.3d 396 (2006). This court agreed. In re Det. of Anderson, 166 Wn.2d 543, 551, 211 P.3d 994 (2009) (Anderson I). However, the majority of this court rejected Anderson\u2019s argument that his sexual contacts with other WSH patients could not be recent overt acts as a matter of law, and therefore remanded for retrial. We specifically stated that the State\u2019s expert testimony regarding Anderson\u2019s sexual contacts at WSH \u201csupport a reasonable apprehension of sexually violent harm, and therefore by definition, Anderson\u2019s sexual activities could constitute overt acts.\u201d Id. at 550.\n\u00b67 On remand, Anderson moved to dismiss, contending that his juvenile adjudication was not a \u201cconviction\u201d and thus he could not be subject to an SVP petition under RCW 71.09.030(1)(e). He also contended that his sexual contacts with other patients at WSH were not recent overt acts as a matter of law. The trial court denied Anderson\u2019s motion to dismiss, and Anderson was retried by a jury. The jury concluded that Anderson is an SVP, and the trial court entered an order committing him to the SCC. The Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished decision. In re Det. of Anderson, noted at 185 Wn. App. 1036 (2015), review granted, 183 Wn.2d 1007, 352 P.3d 187 (2015).\nISSUES\n\u00b68 A. Is a juvenile adjudication for a sexually violent offense a predicate conviction for a sexually violent offense in the context of RCW 71.09.030(l)(e)?\n\u00b69 B. Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that it is the law of this case that Anderson\u2019s sexual contacts at WSH could be overt acts?\n\u00b610 C. Did the State produce sufficient evidence to satisfy its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Anderson is an SVP?\nANALYSIS\nA. Juvenile adjudications for sexually violent offenses are predicate convictions in the context of RCW 71.09.030(l)(e)\n\u00b611 Anderson argues that he cannot be subject to a petition brought under RCW 71.09.030(1)(e), which applies to \u201ca person who at any time previously has been convicted of a sexually violent offense and has since been released from total confinement and has committed a recent overt act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We hold that a juvenile adjudication for a sexually violent offense is a predicate conviction for purposes of RCW 71.09.030(1)(e).\n\u00b6 12 We resolve questions of statutory interpretation de novo. In re Det. of Martin, 163 Wn.2d 501, 506, 182 P.3d 951 (2008). Our goal is \u201c \u2018to ascertain and carry out the intent of the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Rozner v. City of Bellevue, 116 Wn.2d 342, 347, 804 P.2d 24 (1991)).\n\u00b613 \u201cTechnically speaking, juveniles are not \u2018convicted\u2019 of crimes, but rather \u2018adjudicated\u2019 to have committed offenses.\u201d In re Juveniles A, B, C, D, E, 121 Wn.2d 80, 87, 847 P.2d 455 (1993). However, we have long recognized that \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s use of \u2018conviction\u2019 in statutes to refer to juveniles appears to be endemic.\u201d Id.; see also State v. Michaelson, 124 Wn.2d 364, 367, 878 P.2d 1206 (1994). Indeed, even statutes and court rules specifically applicable to juveniles sometimes use the word conviction to refer to juvenile adjudications. See, e.g., RCW 13.40.077 (recommended prosecutorial standards for juvenile court), .215(5) (school placement for \u201ca convicted juvenile sex offender\u201d who has been released from custody), .480 (release of student records regarding juvenile offenders); RCW 13.50-.260(4) (sealing juvenile court records); JuCR 7.12(c)-(d) (criminal history of juvenile offenders). Therefore, when considering whether a statutory reference to convictions includes juvenile adjudications, we cannot rely on the word alone\u2014we consider the particular statutory context and purposes to determine what the legislature intended. Michaelson, 124 Wn.2d at 367; Juveniles A, B, C, D, E, 121 Wn.2d at 87-88.\n\u00b614 Anderson\u2019s argument rests primarily on RCW 71.09-.030(1), which lists the five classes of individuals who may be subject to SVP petitions. Martin, 163 Wn.2d at 507. The statute lists an individual who \u201chas been convicted of a sexually violent offense\u201d separately from an individual \u201cfound to have committed a sexually violent offense as a juvenile.\u201d RCW 71.09.030(1)(a)-(b) (emphasis added). Based on this difference, Anderson contends that the legislature did not intend for juvenile adjudications to be predicate convictions in the context of RCW 71.09.030(1)(e).\n\u00b615 Looking to the statutory scheme as a whole, chapter 71.09 RCW specifically mentions sexually violent offenses committed as a juvenile twice. RCW 71.09.025(1)(a)(ii), .030(1)(b). As originally passed, those statutes plainly listed juvenile adjudications separately to make it clear that chapter 71.09 RCW applied equally to juvenile adjudications and adult convictions for sexually violent offenses. See Laws of 1992, ch. 45, \u00a7 3(1)(a)(i)-(ii); Laws of 1990, ch. 3, \u00a7 1003(1)-(2); In re Pers. Restraint of Young, 122 Wn.2d 1, 54, 857 P.2d 989 (1993) (\u201cBy using the word \u2018offense\u2019, the Legislature indicated an intent to include prior juvenile adjudications within the scope of permissible proof at sex predator proceedings.\u201d). And there is no indication that when the legislature amended RCW 71.09.030(1) by adding a provision for recent overt acts, it intended to create a newfound distinction between convictions and juvenile adjudications in the context of chapter 71.09 RCW. It simply brought the statute into compliance with the due process principles articulated in Young, 122 Wn.2d at 39-42.\n\u00b616 Notably, the current statutory scheme includes several key provisions that do not differentiate between juvenile adjudications and adult convictions, but nevertheless clearly apply to both. For instance, RCW 71.09.030(2) lists the entities that are authorized to file SVP petitions. Martin, 163 Wn.2d at 516. Authorized entities include the prosecuting attorney of any county where \u201c[t]he person has been charged or convicted with a sexually violent offense\u201d or \u201c[a] recent overt act occurred.\u201d RCW 71.09.030(2)(a)(i)-(ii). Conspicuously absent is any mention of the prosecuting attorney of a county where the person has been found to have committed a sexually violent offense as a juvenile. Similarly, RCW 71.09.020(18) defines an SVP in part as \u201cany person who has been convicted of or charged with a crime of sexual violence.\u201d Nowhere does this definition mention a person found to have committed a sexually violent offense as a juvenile. The argument that juvenile adjudications cannot be convictions for purposes of chapter 71.09 RCW is plainly inconsistent with both of these provisions.\n\u00b617 It is not clear how the dissent\u2019s narrow focus on RCW 71.09.030(1), to the exclusion of the rest of chapter 71.09 RCW, can be reconciled with our precedent holding that the meaning of a statutory provision \u201cis discerned from all that the Legislature has said in the statute and related statutes which disclose legislative intent about the provision in question.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 11, 43 P.3d 4 (2002). The dissent\u2019s interpretation also leaves some baffling holes in the SVP statutory scheme. For example, if a juvenile adjudication is not a conviction for the purposes of chapter 71.09 RCW, then no one with a former juvenile adjudication for a sexually violent offense\u2014whether in custody or not\u2014could meet the definition of an SVP found in RCW 71.09.020(18). While that certainly could be a reasonable policy choice, it cannot have been what was actually intended. If it were, surely the legislature would not have explicitly authorized an SVP petition to be filed against a person \u201cfound to have committed a sexually violent offense as a juvenile.\u201d RCW 71.09.030(1)(b). At the very least, reconciling this conflict would require precisely the type of judicial rewriting that the dissent purportedly so abhors. See dissent at 95.\n\u00b618 Similarly, the Juvenile Justice Act of 1977, chapter 13.40 RCW, unmistakably contemplates that a person found to have committed a sexually violent offense as a juvenile who has been released from total confinement may be subject to an SVP petition if he or she commits a recent overt act. See RCW 13.40.210(4)(b)(iii). This strongly indicates that RCW 71.09.030(1)(e) applies equally to adult convictions and juvenile adjudications, just as the rest of chapter 71.09 RCW does.\n\u00b619 We may also consider the legislative purposes underlying chapter 71.09 RCW because \u201cour primary directive is to adopt that interpretation which best advances the statute\u2019s legislative purpose.\u201d Juveniles A, B, C, D, E, 121 Wn.2d at 88. Chapter 71.09 RCW is primarily concerned with public safety: \u201cAlthough the ultimate goal of the statute is to treat, and someday cure, those whose mental condition causes them to commit acts of sexual violence, its immediate purpose is to ensure the commitment of these persons in order to protect the community.\u201d Young, 122 Wn.2d at 10. This purpose is better served by treating juvenile adjudications for sexually violent offenses as convictions for purposes of RCW 71.09.030(1)(e). Cf. Juveniles A, B, C, D, E, 121 Wn.2d at 89 (holding that a statute mandating human immunodeficiency virus testing for those \u201cconvicted\u201d of sex offenses applies to juvenile adjudications, due in part to \u201cthe legislative mandate to protect the health of victims, offenders, and society\u201d).\n\u00b620 In light of the full statutory context presented, we hold that a juvenile adjudication for a sexually violent offense is a predicate conviction for purposes of RCW 71.09.030(1)(e), and that Anderson\u2019s juvenile adjudication for first degree statutory rape was a sufficient predicate conviction.\nB. The Court of Appeals properly held it is the law of this case that Anderson\u2019s sexual contacts at WSH could be overt acts\n\u00b621 On remand, Anderson moved to dismiss the State\u2019s petition, arguing that noncriminal sexual activities between adults cannot be \u201covert\u201d acts as a matter of law. This court has already held, however, that Anderson\u2019s sexual contacts at WSH could be overt acts:\nDr. Phenix testified, and the trial court found, that Anderson engaged in sexual activity with vulnerable patients as substitutes for his preferred victims, children. As the Court of Appeals noted, Anderson\u2019s acts of exploiting vulnerable adults were closely akin to his assaults on children. Anderson also had ongoing sexual fantasies of children involving sexual violence. Dr. Phenix and other specialists who were familiar with Anderson\u2019s history and mental condition concluded in light of these factors that he posed a clear risk to reoffend if released from custody. Those expert opinions support a reasonable apprehension of sexually violent harm, and therefore by definition, Anderson\u2019s sexual activities could constitute overt acts.\nAnderson I, 166 Wn.2d at 550 (footnote omitted). That is the law of this case, and we decline to revisit it. Whether the State proved Anderson\u2019s WSH contacts actually were overt acts depends on the sufficiency of the evidence presented at the trial on remand. That is a separate issue, which we address below.\nC. The State presented sufficient evidence that Anderson is an SVP\n\u00b622 On remand, the jury was instructed that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201c[t]hat John Anderson has committed a recent overt act.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 755. Anderson contends that the State did not present sufficient evidence to prove his sexual contacts at WSH were \u201covert\u201d within the meaning of RCW 71.09.020(12). We hold the State produced sufficient evidence to meet its burden.\n\u00b623 When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in the context of SVP proceedings, we apply a similar standard to that used in criminal cases:\n[T]he evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the State and all reasonable inferences from the evidence must be drawn in favor of the State and interpreted most strongly against the respondent. The commitment will be upheld if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\nIn re Det. of Audett, 158 Wn.2d 712, 727-28, 147 P.3d 982 (2006) (citations omitted). To determine whether the State produced sufficient evidence to meet its burden of proving an overt act, we must answer two questions:\nfirst, an inquiry must be made into the factual circumstances of the individual\u2019s history and mental condition; second, a legal inquiry must be made as to whether an objective person knowing the factual circumstances of the individual\u2019s history and mental condition would have a reasonable apprehension that the individual\u2019s act would cause harm of a sexually violent nature.\nIn re Det. of Marshall, 156 Wn.2d 150, 158, 125 P.3d 111 (2005).\n1. Factual inquiry\n\u00b624 Looking first to Anderson\u2019s history, the State produced evidence of numerous incidents where Anderson took sexual advantage of others who were comparatively physically, emotionally, or intellectually vulnerable. Before the age of 18, Anderson committed numerous sexual offenses. He manipulated a younger child into performing oral sex on him multiple times. He lured a five-year-old into a secluded area with the intention of raping her. He had a sexual encounter that clearly became nonconsensual when the other child told Anderson to stop and he refused. He did not realize that this was rape until told so years later, and as recently as 2011, he still described that encounter as \u201cmutual.\u201d CP at 475. Anderson also raped a two-year-old whom he was babysitting on about a dozen separate occasions. When Anderson was 17, he raped a different two-year-old, resulting in a juvenile adjudication for first degree statutory rape.\n\u00b625 As to Anderson\u2019s mental condition, the State presented evidence that Anderson suffers from pedophilia and sexual sadism. An expert witness for the State also diagnosed Anderson with a \u201cpersonality disorder not otherwise specified with antisocial[,] borderline [,] and narcissistic traits.\u201d 8 VRP (May 8, 2013) at 538. Those traits predispose Anderson to violating other people\u2019s rights and acting impulsively, and reduce his ability to experience empathy, insight, and remorse about the consequences of his behavior. While at WSH, Anderson participated in sex offender treatment, but the State presented testimony that the treatment was largely ineffective.\n\u00b626 The State alleged that four of Anderson\u2019s sexual contacts at WSH were overt acts because the other participants were significantly more vulnerable to sexually violent harm than Anderson was\u2014three were developmental^ disabled and one had a severe personality disorder. Staff at WSH viewed these contacts as exploitative and counseled Anderson to end them, but Anderson disregarded the harm he was causing and refused to end the contacts.\n2. Legal inquiry\n\u00b627 \u201c[T]he legal inquiry determines whether an objective person knowing [the] factual circumstances would have a reasonable apprehension of harm of a sexually violent nature resulting from the act in question.\u201d State v. McNutt, 124 Wn. App. 344, 350, 101 P.3d 422 (2004). This inquiry depends on the specific behavior alleged to constitute a recent overt act, considered in light of the history and mental condition of the alleged SVP. Marshall, 156 Wn.2d at 159.\n\u00b628 Anderson\u2019s history reveals a pattern of sexual behaviors directed at comparatively vulnerable individuals. The State introduced evidence that Anderson often did not anticipate or recognize the harmful effects of his behavior\u2014 for instance, he had to be told that continuing to have sex with someone after that person tells him to stop is rape. The State also introduced evidence that even when Anderson did know that his behavior was harmful, he persisted\u2014for instance, repeatedly raping a two-year-old who screamed and bled. The evidence presented regarding Anderson\u2019s mental conditions shed light on his inability or refusal to consider the harmful effects of his behavior\u2014his sexual disorders predispose him to engage in sexual behavior that harms others, and his personality disorders predispose him to impulsivity, lack of empathy, and exploitation.\n\u00b629 Unrestricted release into the community is certain to present unexpected circumstances. A person predisposed to commit sexually violent offenses must be able to recognize what activities might cause sexually violent harm and refrain from engaging in them. Anderson has a long history of failing to do so. The sexual contacts Anderson had at WSH are consistent with that pattern. Based on this information, an objective person might have a reasonable apprehension that Anderson would cause sexually violent harm if released into the community.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b630 We hold that Anderson\u2019s juvenile adjudication for first degree statutory rape was a predicate conviction for purposes of RCW 71.09.030(l)(e). It is the law of this case that Anderson\u2019s sexual contacts at WSH could be overt acts, and we decline to revisit the merits of that issue. Finally, we hold that the State presented sufficient evidence to prove that Anderson\u2019s sexual contacts at WSH were \u201covert\u201d acts within the meaning of RCW 71.09.020(12). We affirm his civil commitment.\nMadsen, C.J., and Owens, Fairhurst, and Gonz\u00e1lez, JJ., concur.\nThe State concedes Anderson was not in total confinement at WSH.\nThe relevant statutes have been revised numerous times since the State filed its petition. None of the revisions are material to our analysis, so we cite the current versions.\nAlthough Anderson did not raise this argument until he was back before the trial court on remand, the trial court exercised its discretion to reach the merits, and we do as well. See RAP 2.5(c)(1); Clerk\u2019s Papers at 433 (\u201cThe Legislature intended that the term \u2018convicted\u2019 in RCW 71.09.030(1)(e) refer to adjudications for both juvenile and adult sexual offenses.\u2019\u2019).\nWe acknowledge that if juvenile adjudications are convictions in the context of chapter 71.09 RCW, these two statutes separately mentioning juvenile adjudications become somewhat redundant. However, these isolated redundancies are not sufficient to overcome the overall statutory context and purposes. Cf. Juveniles A, B, C, D, E, 121 Wn.2d at 88.\nWhile RCW 71.09.020(18) and RCW 71.09.030(2) both mention a person who has been \u201ccharged\u201d with a sexually violent offense, we cannot interpret that to include charges brought against a juvenile that result in an adjudication of guilt. A charge cannot form the basis for civil commitment as an SVP unless the person \u201chas been determined to be incompetent to stand trial\u201d or \u201chas been found not guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d RCW 71.09.030(1)(c)-(d).\nThere are indeed conceivable reasons why the legislature might choose to differentiate between juvenile adjudications and adult convictions in any number of situations. See dissent at 95. Indeed, this court has recognized situations where the particular nature of juvenile development and the special treatment they are afforded due to their immaturity are highly relevant as a matter of statutory or constitutional law. See, e.g., State v. O\u2019Dell, 183 Wn.2d 680, 358 P.3d 359 (2015); State v. S.J.C., 183 Wn.2d 408, 352 P.3d 749 (2015). We empathize with the concerns raised by the seemingly harsh treatment or consequences that may arise in this situation, but we must attempt to discern and effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent based on the information available to us now. The overwhelming weight of that information indicates that the dissent\u2019s interpretation is not what the legislature intended. The legislature unquestionably may revise the statutory language if our analysis is flawed. See dissent at 95.\nWe may reexamine our prior decision \u201cwhere justice would best be served,\u2019\u2019 RAP 2.5(c)(2), but Anderson does not point to any circumstances that would justify doing so, see Chem. Bank v. Wash. Pub. Power Supply Sys., 102 Wn.2d 874, 885-86, 691 P.2d 524 (1984).\nAnderson\u2019s briefing to this court does not challenge any of the other elements of the State\u2019s case or argue that his sexual contacts at WSH were not \u201crecent.\u201d",

        "text": "Johnson, J.\n\u00b631 (dissenting) In the area of juvenile justice, the legislature expressly established what, where, and how juvenile criminal adjudications play a role in future proceedings. These comprehensive policy decisions are reflected in specific statutory sections. The majority rewrites and disrupts these legislative choices, essentially based on the majority\u2019s disagreement with the explicit choices the legislature established. The statute as written simply does not subject John Anderson to civil commitment.\n\u00b632 As an initial matter, RCW 13.04.240, governing statutory references to juvenile delinquents or juvenile delinquency, expressly states, \u201cAn order of court adjudging a child a juvenile offender or dependent under the provisions of this chapter shall in no case be deemed a conviction of crime.\u201d Throughout the entire statutory scheme, certain juvenile adjudications play a role in other proceedings where the statute expressly provides. The majority recognizes those statutory distinctions and choices, yet ignores the express statutory language. The relevant sections of the statute at issue here provide:\nA petition may be filed alleging that a person is a sexually violent predator and stating sufficient facts to support such allegation when it appears that: . . .\n(b) a person found to have committed a sexually violent offense as a juvenile is about to be released from total confinement;... or\n(e) a person who at any time previously has been convicted of a sexually violent offense and has since been released from total confinement and has committed a recent overt act.\nRCW 71.09.030(1) (emphasis added).\n\u00b633 Subsection (l)(b) applies to juveniles who are in custody after having committed a sexually violent offense. Conversely, subsection (l)(e) expressly applies to persons convicted of a sexually violent offense. This language could not be clearer and needs no interpretation. Juveniles are not convicted of crimes, and we should not rewrite the statute where the language is clear and unambiguous on its face. Subsections (l)(a) through (d) affect individuals either presently in custody and about to be released or released from custody. Subsection (l)(e) creates a different classification in that it pertains only to those defendants who were \u201cconvicted\u201d of a sexually violent offense, have since been released from total confinement, and have committed a recent overt act. The majority purports to consider the legislative history in an attempt to advance its reading of the purpose of the statute and concludes that the legislature meant to establish that a juvenile adjudication for a sexually violent offense is a predicate conviction for purposes of subsection (l)(e), and then finds Anderson\u2019s prior juvenile adjudication a sufficient predicate conviction. The majority has to ignore the language of subsection (l)(b) that differs markedly from the language of the section the majority strains itself to rewrite. Subsection (l)(b) pertains to \u201cperson[s] found to have committed a sexually violent offense as a juvenile [and who are] about to be released from total confinement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This express language unambiguously draws a distinction within the section of the statute between persons convicted of violent offenses and juveniles who have committed sexually violent offenses. The statute by its terms clearly does not apply to Anderson. Our role in interpreting statutes should be to focus on the words of a statute and refrain from second-guessing clear and unambiguous language.\n\u00b634 By concluding that Anderson\u2019s interpretation of the statute\u2019s clear and unambiguous language is \u201cplainly inconsistent\u201d with the statutory scheme under chapter 71.09 RCW, the majority rewrites the statute. Majority at 87. Anderson does not fall within the class of individuals subject to a petition under chapter 71.09 RCW. Anderson has never been convicted of a crime.\n\u00b635 The majority ignores that the Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration system already has the necessary procedures and the requisite judicial power necessary to deal with juveniles that the adult criminal system does not. Many reasons conceivably support the legislative choice in treating juvenile offenders differently, and where statutes expressly provide for different treatment, no need exists to rewrite those statutes. Moreover, if the legislature disagrees with our statutory analysis, it can surely revise the language in that statute in any way it chooses. We should not.\n\u00b636 Mr. Anderson is not subject to commitment under this statute, and the order of commitment should be vacated.\nStephens, Wiggins, and Gordon McCloud, JJ., concur with Johnson, J.\nReconsideration denied April 26, 2016.",

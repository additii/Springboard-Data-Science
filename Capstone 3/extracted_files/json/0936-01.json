        "text": "Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\n\u00b61 In Washington, health insurance premiums are approved by the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC). Under the nationally recognized, court created \u201cfiled rate doctrine,\u201d once an agency approves a rate, such as a health insurance premium, courts will not reevaluate that rate because doing so would inappropriately usurp the agency\u2019s role. However, courts may consider claims that are related to rates approved by an agency but do not require the courts to reevaluate such rates. In most cases, Washington courts must consider Consumer Protection Act (CPA), chapter 19.86 RCW, claims alleging general damages merely related to agency-approved rates. In the case before us, however, the plaintiffs allege that several entities doing business in the health insurance field violated the CPA but request specific damages the award of which would require a court to reevaluate the reasonableness of health insurance premiums approved by the OIC. Because awarding the specific damages requested by the plaintiffs would require a court to inappropriately substitute its judgment for that of the OIC, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\nFacts\n\u00b62 The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges that two groups of defendants, (1) Premera, Premera Blue Cross, and LifeWise Health Plan of Washington (collectively Premera) and (2) the Washington Alliance for Healthcare Insurance Trust and its trustee, F. Bentley Lovejoy (collectively WAHIT), colluded and made false and misleading representations to the plaintiffs that induced the plaintiffs to purchase health insurance policies under false pretenses.\n\u00b63 Premera is a group of nonprofit health care service contractors that receive premiums from groups and individuals in return for providing health care services through a network of providers. Ch. 24.03 RCW; RCW 48.44.010(9), .020(1). The Washington Alliance for Healthcare Insurance Trust is a nonprofit trust designed to hold insurance policies through which participating employers can obtain health benefit plans for their employees; the trust is not a Premera affiliate.\n\u00b64 The plaintiffs are several companies and one individual who purchased Premera policies (Policyholders). The Policyholders wish to form classes of groups and individuals that purchased Premera policies: class A, the large group class, consists of employer groups of more than 50 persons; class B, the small group class, consists of employee groups of at least 1 but not more than 50 employees; and class C consists of individuals.\n\u00b65 The Policyholders claim that Premera and WAHIT violated the CPA. As the Court of Appeals summarized, the Policyholders claim CPA violations\nbased on (a) assertions on the WAHIT website that it is an \u201cemployer governed trust,\u201d (b) advertising in WAHIT mailings that it \u201cnegotiate [s]\u201d to obtain high quality benefits at the \u201clowest possible cost\u201d or \u201cmost affordable cost,\u201d (c) assertions that WAHIT is a \u201cmember governed group,\u201d (d) allegations that the insurers \u201cfalsely stated publicly that the reasons for the annual premium increases are because of increases in the cost of medical, hospital and health care\u201d and \u201cconcealed from the plaintiffs and class members the fact that the percentage increases in those costs were not required to justify the increase in premiums,\u201d and (e) allegations that the insurers \u201ccreated [WAHIT]\u201d in order to enable it to accumulate its surplus.\nMcCarthy Fin., Inc. v. Premera, 182 Wn. App. 1, 18, 328 P.3d 940 (2014) (alterations in original). The Policyholders allege that due to Premera and WAHIT\u2019s violations of the CPA they experienced \u201cexcessive, unnecessary, unfair and deceptive overcharges for health insurance,\u201d resulting in Premera obtaining \u201cprofits of millions of dollars\u201d that helped enable Premera to amass a surplus of approximately $1 billion. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 10-11. The Policyholders also claim \u201cthat for a non-profit corporation to amass over $1 billion in surplus is contrary to the non-profit statute under which PREMERA ... is chartered and is a violation of public policy.\u201d Id. at 19.\n\u00b66 The plaintiffs request only two specific forms of damages: (1) for the \u201cunfair business practices and excessive overcharges for premiums,\u201d the plaintiffs request \u201cthe sum of the excess premiums paid to the defendants,\u201d in other words, a \u201crefund\u00ed ] of the gross and excessive overcharges in premium payments\u201d and (2) \u201c[i]f the surplus is excessive and unreasonable,\u201d the plaintiffs assert that \u201cthe amount of the excess surplus should be refunded to the subscribers who have paid the high premiums causing the excess.\u201d Id. at 28.\n\u00b67 On Premera and WAHIT\u2019s motion, the trial court dismissed the Policyholders\u2019 suit in its entirety based on the filed rate, primary jurisdiction, and exhaustion of remedies doctrines. Specifically, the trial court dismissed all claims of class B (small group) and class C (individuals) pursuant to CR 12(b)(6) and dismissed all claims of class A (large group) on summary judgment under CR 56. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court in relation to certain of the Policyholders\u2019 CPA claims, which are identified above. McCarthy, 182 Wn. App. at 18. We granted Premera and WAHIT\u2019s petition for review. McCarthy Fin., Inc. v. Premera, 181 Wn.2d 1013, 337 P.3d 325 (2014).\nAnalysis\nA. Standard of Review\n\u00b68 The trial court dismissed all of the Policyholders\u2019 claims on a CR 12(b)(6) motion or on summary judgment. CP at 157-58, 274-75. We review both dismissals de novo. FutureSelect Portfolio Mgmt., Inc. v. Tremont Grp. Holdings, Inc., 180 Wn.2d 954, 962, 331 P.3d 29 (2014) (citing Kinney v. Cook, 159 Wn.2d 837, 842, 154 P.3d 206 (2007)); Jones v. Allstate Ins. Co., 146 Wn.2d 291, 300, 45 P.3d 1068 (2002) (citing Lybbert v. Grant County, 141 Wn.2d 29, 34, 1 P.3d 1124 (2000)).\nB. The Filed Rate Doctrine\n\u00b69 Health insurance premiums in Washington must be approved by the OIC. RCW 48.44.017(2), .020-.024, .040, .070, .110, .120, .180; WAC 284-43-901, -910 through -930, -945, -950. Among its powers, the OIC may disapprove (1) ambiguous or misleading contracts and deceptive solicitations and (2) contracts the benefits of which are \u201cunreasonable in relation to the amount charged for the contract.\u201d RCW 48.44.020(3), (2), .110. The OIC considers numerous factors when determining whether a health insurance premium is reasonable, including \u201c[h]ow much profit the company expects to make[,] . . . generally called \u2018contribution to surplus\u2019 or \u2018projected profit[,]\u2019... [which] depends on the company\u2019s current level of surplus as well as the type of business.\u201d CP at 323. The Policyholders do not challenge that the QIC approved the health insurance premiums that the Policyholders paid.\n\u00b610 Consumers\u2019 power to challenge agency-approved rates is limited by the common law filed rate doctrine. See Wegoland, Ltd. v. NYNEX Corp., 806 F. Supp. 1112, 1113-16 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (providing a history of the doctrine). As this court observed:\nThe \u201cfiled rate\u201d doctrine, also known as the \u201cfiled tariff\u201d doctrine, is a court-created rule to bar suits against regulated utilities involving allegations concerning the reasonableness of the filed rates. This doctrine provides, in essence, that any \u201cfiled rate\u201d \u2014 a rate filed with and approved by the governing regulatory agency \u2014 is per se reasonable and cannot be the subject of legal action against the private entity that filed it. The purposes of the \u201cfiled rate\u201d doctrine are twofold: (1) to preserve the agency\u2019s primary jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of rates, and (2) to insure that regulated entities charge only those rates approved by the agency. These principles serve to provide safeguards against price discrimination and are essential in stabilizing prices. But this doctrine, which operates under the assumption that the public is conclusively presumed to have knowledge of the filed rates, has often been invoked rigidly, even to bar claims arising from fraud or misrepresentation.\nTenore v. AT&T Wireless Servs., 136 Wn.2d 322, 331-32, 962 P.2d 104 (1998) (footnotes omitted). In cases such as this that involve claims and damages related to agency-approved rates, courts must determine whether the claims and damages are merely incidental to agency-approved rates and therefore may be considered by courts or would necessarily require courts to reevaluate agency-approved rates and therefore may not be considered by courts. See id. at 344.\n\u00b611 But while a court must be cautious not to substitute its judgment on proper rate setting for that of the relevant agency, the legislature has directed that the CPA be liberally construed. See, e.g., RCW 19.86.920; Panag v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Wash., 166 Wn.2d 27, 37, 204 P.3d 885 (2009); Indoor Billboard/Wash., Inc. v. Integra Telecom of Wash., Inc., 162 Wn.2d 59, 73, 170 P.3d 10 (2007); Short v. Demopolis, 103 Wn.2d 52, 60, 691 P.2d 163 (1984). The mere fact that a claim is related to an agency-approved rate is no bar. The CPA itself addresses the limited times when agency action exempts application of the CPA. See RCW 19.86.170; Vogt v. Seattle-First Nat'l Bank, 117 Wn.2d 541, 550-52, 817 P.2d 1364 (1991); In re Real Estate Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 95 Wn.2d 297, 300-01, 622 P.2d 1185 (1980)). In most cases, courts must consider CPA claims even when the requested damages are related to agency-approved rates because, to the extent that claimants can prove damages without attacking agency-approved rates, the benefits gained from courts\u2019 considering CPA claims outweigh any benefit that would be derived from applying the filed rate doctrine to bar the claims.\n\u00b612 In this case, however, rather than requesting general damages or seeking any damages that do not directly attack agency-approved rates, the Policyholders specifically request (1) a \u201crefund[ ] of the gross and excessive overcharges in premium payments\u201d and (2) a refund of \u201cthe amount of the excess surplus.\u201d CP at 28. The Policyholders\u2019 requested damages cause their CPA claims to run squarely against the filed rate doctrine. Even assuming that the Policyholders can successfully prove all the elements of their CPA claims, a court\u2019s awarding either of the two specific damages requested by the Policyholders would run contrary to the purposes of the filed rate doctrine because the court would need to determine what health insurance premiums would have been reasonable for the Policyholders to pay as a baseline for calculating the amount of damages and the OIC has already determined that the health insurance premiums paid by the Policyholders were reasonable. Accordingly, the Policyholders\u2019 claims are barred by the filed rate doctrine because to award either of the specific damages requested by the Policyholders a court would need to reevaluate rates approved by the OIC and thereby inappropriately usurp the role of the OIC.\n\u00b613 Given that application of the filed rate doctrine is decisive in this case, we decline to address either the primary jurisdiction or exhaustion of remedies doctrines.\nConclusion\n\u00b614 We reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the Policyholders\u2019 claims.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gordon McCloud, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nReconsideration denied June 3, 2015.",

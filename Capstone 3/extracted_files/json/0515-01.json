        "text": "Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\n\u00b61 KOMO news reporter Tracy Vedder made three unsuccessful public records requests to the Seattle Police Department (SPD) relating to \u201cdash-cam\u201d videos taken by SPD officers. We conclude that two of the requests should have been granted.\nFacts\n\u00b62 Since 2007, SPD\u2019s entire patrol fleet has been equipped with in-car video and sound recording equipment. SPD\u2019s recording system was manufactured by COBAN Technologies, a private company that provides both the recording equipment and the computer system that manages at least the initial video storage and retrieval. The COBAN system was not integrated into SPD\u2019s records management system or its computer aided dispatch system, and at least at the time this case arose, recordings could be searched only by \u201cofficer\u2019s name, serial number, date and time.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 403, 440, 454.\n\u00b63 SPD\u2019s written policy directs officers to use their in-car video recorders to \u201cdocument all traffic stops, pursuits, vehicle searches and citizen contacts when occurring within camera range.\u201d CP at 88 (SPD Policies and Procedures ch. 17.260). Under this written policy, videos are kept for 90 days unless an officer tags an individual video as \u201crequired for case investigation/prosecution,\u201d in which case they are kept for at least three years. Id. Under SPD policy, videos needed longer than three years should be burned onto a DVD (digital video disc) and stored in a relevant case file. Otherwise, videos are scheduled to be destroyed after three years.\n\u00b64 In 2010, Vedder made both informal requests for information and a series of formal Public Records Act (PRA), chapter 42.56 RCW, requests. On August 3, 2010 she asked for user and training manuals on the dash-cam video system. SPD denied this request on the grounds the materials were protected under federal copyright law and RCW 42.56.240(1)\u2019s exception for materials essential to effective law enforcement.\n\u00b65 On August 4, 2010, Vedder requested \u201ca copy of any and all Seattle police officer\u2019s log sheets that correspond to any and all in-car video/audio records which have been tagged for retention by officers. This request is for such records dating from January 1, 2005 to the present.\u201d CP at 96. On August 10, 2010, SPD\u2019s public record\u2019s officer, Sheila Friend Gray, responded that no relevant records existed.\n\u00b66 The next day, Vedder requested \u201ca list of any and all digital in-car video/audio recordings that have been tagged for retention by Seattle Police Officers from January 1, 2005 to the present. This list should include, but not be limited to, the officer\u2019s name, badge number, date, time and location when the video was tagged for retention and any other notation that accompanied the retention tag.\u201d CP at 98. On August 18, SPD denied the request on the grounds that \u201cSPD is unable to query the system in the way you have requested. We can search by individual officer name, date, and time only. We cannot generate mass retention reports due to system limitations. Thus we do not have any responsive records.\u201d CP at 99.\n\u00b67 On September 1, 2010, Vedder requested \u201ccopies of any and all digital, in-car video/audio recordings from the Seattle Police Department that have been tagged for retention by anyone from January 2007 to the present. The recordings should also include, but not be limited to, corresponding identifying information such as the date, time, location, and officer(s) connected to each unique recording.\u201d CP at 110. SPD contacted COBAN for help with this request. COBAN told SPD that such a list could be generated by running a computer script that COBAN was willing to provide for free, but coding the program to enable mass copying of the videos \u201cwill take some real programming\u201d and would cost at least $1,500. CP at 239. SPD denied Vedder\u2019s third request on October 1,2010, telling her, \u201c \u2018SPD is unable to query the system to generate a retention report that would provide a list of the retained videos.\u2019 Without this capability we are unable to respond to your request. Therefore we have no documents responsive to your request.\u201d CP at 254. After Vedder pressed the matter, SPD\u2019s attorney told her that the privacy act prevented release of the videos that were less than three years old.\n\u00b68 Meanwhile, in February 2011, Eric Rachner requested \u201ca copy of the full and complete database of all Coban D [igital] V[ideo] M[anagment] S[ystem (DVMS)] activity logs in electronic form.\u201d CP at 40. He suggested since \u201cCoban DVMS system\u2019s database runs on [a] Microsoft SQL [(structured query language)] server,... it should be convenient to provide the logs, in electronic form, in their original Microsoft SQL Server format. The responsive records will include all rows of all columns of all tables related to the logging of video-related activity within the Coban DVMS.\u201d Id. After working closely with Rachner, SPD began to provide the records in June. That summer, Rachner showed Vedder what he had received from SPD. According to Vedder, \u201cI was amazed because the COBAN DVMS database provided to Mr. Rachner was exactly the sort of list of videos in electronic format that I had requested on August 11, 2010.\u201d CP at 81.\n\u00b69 On September 19, 2011, KOMO sued SPD under the PRA for failing to timely produce records in response to Vedder\u2019s August 4, August 11, and September 1, 2010 requests, among other things. The next day the SPD gave Vedder a copy of materials it had produced for Rachner. Early in 2012, both parties moved for summary judgment. Judge Rogers found that SPD properly denied Vedder\u2019s request for police officer\u2019s log sheets and for the videos themselves. However, he found SPD had improperly rejected Vedder\u2019s request for the list of videos. The court initially levied a \u201c$25.00 a day fine from the day Mr. Rachner received his first batch of COBAN files to the day Ms. Vedder received her COBAN files,\u201d plus fees and costs. CP at 540.\n\u00b610 We granted direct review. SPD is supported on review by the Washington State Association of Municipal Attorneys and the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs. KOMO is supported on review by the Washington Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Washington Defender Association and the Defender Association, and the News Media Entities and Washington Coalition for Open Government.\nAnalysis\n\u00b611 \u201cThe PRA mandates broad public disclosure.\u201d Sargent v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 179 Wn.2d 376, 385, 314 P.3d 1093 (2013) (citing RCW 42.56.030); Hearst Corp. v. Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d 123, 127, 580 P.2d 246 (1978). It declares that \u201c[t]he people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know.\u201d RCW 42.56.030. The PRA is \u201cliberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other act, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.\u201d Id. To that end, State and local agencies are required to disclose their records upon request, unless the record falls within an exception. Gendler v. Batiste, 174 Wn.2d 244, 251, 274 P.3d 346 (2012) (citing RCW 42.56.070(1)). The agency refusing to release records bears the burden of showing secrecy is lawful. Sargent, 179 Wn.2d at 385-86 (citing Newman v. King County, 133 Wn.2d 565, 571, 947 P.2d 712 (1997)). The PRA does not, however, require agencies to \u201c \u2018create or produce a record that is nonexistent.\u2019 \u201d Gendler, 174 Wn.2d at 252 (quoting Sperr v. City of Spokane, 123 Wn. App. 132, 136-37, 96 P.3d 1012 (2004)).\n\u00b612 Agencies must make a sincere and adequate search for records. RCW 42.56.100; Neigh. All. of Spokane County v. Spokane County, 172 Wn.2d 702, 720, 723, 261 P.3d 119 (2011). When an agency denies a public records request on the grounds that no responsive records exist, its response should show at least some evidence that it sincerely attempted to be helpful. See, e.g., Neigh. All., 172 Wn.2d at 722.\n\u00b613 Our review of both the agency action and the court opinions below is de novo. Gendler, 174 Wn.2d at 251 (citing RCW 42.56.550(3)).\n1. \u201cOfficers\u2019 Log Sheets\u201d\n\u00b614 Vedder requested \u201ca copy of any and all Seattle police officers\u2019 log sheets that correspond to any and all in-car video/audio records which have been tagged for retention by officers. This request is for such records dating from January 1, 2005 to the present.\u201d CP at 96. The department responded that it had no relevant records. Judge Rogers found this did not violate the PRA. We agree.\n\u00b615 Records requestors are not required to use the exact name of the record, but requests must be for identifiable records or class of records. Wash. State Bar Ass\u2019n, Public Records Act Deskbook: Washington\u2019s Public Disclosure and Open Public Meetings Laws \u00a7 4.1(1)-(2) (2006 ed. & 2010 Supp.). The record establishes that \u201clog sheets\u201d specifically referred to paper forms that had not been used since 2002 and that these forms had been destroyed in 2004. Among other things, David Strom, senior warehouser of archival records for the SPD, testified that \u201clog sheets\u201d were \u201cpaper forms that officers filled out during their patrols. The log sheets\u2019 contained areas in which officers entered information regarding calls dispatched via radio, location, clearance code, notes, mileage and vehicle condition.\u201d CP at 399. Friend Gray looked for responsive records, was told definitively that \u201cofficer\u2019s log sheets\u201d referred to a specific class of documents that no longer existed, and communicated her finding to Vedder. We find SPD\u2019s response complied with the PRA and affirm Judge Rogers\u2019 denial of this claim.\n2. \u201cList of All Retained Videos\u201d\n\u00b6 16 We turn now to Vedder\u2019s request for \u201ca list of any and all digital in-car video/audio recordings that have been tagged for retention by Seattle Police Officers from January 1,2005 [, including] officer\u2019s name, badge number, date, time and location when the video was tagged for retention and any other notation that accompanied the retention tag.\u201d CP at 98. Judge Rogers found SPD violated the PRA when it told Vedder it had no responsive records. We agree.\n\u00b617 SPD contends that Vedder was asking it to create a new record. This is clearly true to some extent; producing a document that would correlate all of the information Vedder requested would have required mining data from two distinct systems and creating a new document. This is more than the PRA requires. Citizens for Fair Share v. Dep\u2019t of Corr, 117 Wn. App. 411, 435, 72 P.3d 206 (2003) (citing Smith v. Okanogan County, 100 Wn. App. 7, 13-14, 994 P.2d 857 (2000)). However, as SPD\u2019s later response to Rachner demonstrated, it did have the capacity to produce a partially responsive record at the time it denied her request. It should have done so.\n\u00b618 We recognize that neither the PRA itself nor our case law have clearly defined the difference between ereation and production of public records, likely because this question did not arise before the widespread use of electronically stored data. Given the way public records are now stored (and, in many cases, initially generated), there will not always be a simple dichotomy between producing an existing record and creating a new one. But \u201cpublic record\u201d is broadly defined and includes \u201cexisting data compilations from which information may be obtained\u201d \u201cregardless of physical form or characteristics.\u201d RCW 42.56.010(4), (3). This broad definition includes electronic information in a database. Id.; see also WAC 44-14-04001. Merely because information is in a database designed for a different purpose does not exempt it from disclosure. Nor does it necessarily make the production of information a \u201ccreation\u201d of a record.\n\u00b619 Whether a particular public records request asks an agency to produce or create a record will likely often turn on the specific facts of the case and thus may not always be resolved at summary judgment. But for SPD\u2019s response to Rachner\u2019s request, this might well have been such a case. However, the uncontroverted evidence presented showed that a partial response could have been produced at the time of the original denial. The failure to do so violated the PRA.\n\u00b620 In the alternative, SPD argues that Vedder was requesting metadata and that while metadata is subject to the PRA, it must be specifically requested. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 33 (citing O\u2019Neill v. City of Shoreline, 170 Wn.2d 138, 151-52, 240 P.3d 1149 (2010)). In O\u2019Neill, we defined \u201cmetadata\u201d as \u201c \u2018data about data\u2019 or hidden information about electronic documents created by software programs.\u201d 170 Wn.2d at 143 (quoting Jembaa Cole, When Invisible Electronic Ink Leaves Red Faces: Tactical, Legal and Ethical Consequences of the Failure to Remove Metadata, 1 Shidler J.L. Com. & Tech. 8, \u00b6 7 (Feb. 2, 2005)). But Vedder was not seeking to peer beneath some text in an electronic database. She was not requesting metadata in any meaningful sense.\n\u00b621 We find the rest of SPD\u2019s arguments unavailing. We hold that SPD violated the PRA when it incorrectly told Vedder it had no responsive records and affirm.\n3. The Videos and the Privacy Act\n\u00b622 We turn now to Vedder\u2019s request for \u201ccopies of any and all digital, in-car video/audio recordings from the Seattle Police Department that have been tagged for retention by anyone from January 2007 to the present.\u201d CP at 110. After consulting with COBAN, SPD denied this request based on the grounds that it was \u201c \u2018unable to query the system to generate a report that would provide a list of retained videos.\u2019 Without this capability we are unable to respond to your request.\u201d CP at 254. But SPD had the capability to produce the list, so to the extent that its ability to produce the videos was contingent on its ability to produce the list, its initial response violated the PRA.\n\u00b623 SPD also argues it is barred from releasing the videos by RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) of the privacy act. Under the PRA, \u201cother statutes\u201d may exempt or prohibit disclosure of certain records or information. See Ameriquest Mortg. Co. v. Office of Att\u2019y Gen., 170 Wn.2d 418, 440, 241 P.3d 1245 (2010) (quoting RCW 42.56.070(1)). All exceptions, including \u201cother statute\u201d exceptions, are construed narrowly. Hearst, 90 Wn.2d at 138-39. Generally, Washington\u2019s privacy act requires all parties to a private communication to consent to any recording. RCW 9.73.030. However, some recordings made by police are exempted from disclosure whether or not they record private conversations. Relevantly:\nThe provisions of RCW 9.73.030 through 9.73.080[] shall not apply to police ... in the following instances:\n(c) Sound recordings that correspond to video images recorded by video cameras mounted in law enforcement vehicles.\nNo sound or video recording made under this subsection (l)(c) may be duplicated and made available to the public by a law enforcement agency subject to this section until final disposition of any criminal or civil litigation which arises from the event or events which were recorded.\nRCW 9.73.090(1). SPD argues that this statute functions as an \u201cother statute\u201d exception to the PRA. We agree in part, but given the general rule that exemptions are to be interpreted narrowly, RCW 42.56.030, we find this exemption is limited to cases where the videos relate to actual, pending litigation.\n\u00b624 The legislature added RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) in 2000. Laws of 2000, ch. 195, \u00a7 2. It stated that its intent was \u201cto provide a very limited exception to the restrictions on disclosure of intercepted communications.\u201d Laws of 2000, ch. 195, \u00a7 1. Prior to that time, RCW 9.73.090 had authorized certain law enforcement and emergency recordings and restricted their use to \u201cvalid police or court activities.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2. This amendment and the statement of legislative intent strongly suggest that the legislature intended to provide greater guidance on the use of these authorized recordings. It does not suggest the legislature intended to create a broad categorical exception to the PRA. We note that neither the statute nor even the bill reports mention the PRA or its predecessor. See, e.g., H.B. Rep. on H.B. 2876, 59th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2006); H.B. Rep. on H.B. 2903, 56th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2000); RCW 42.56.050, .240. Indeed, exempting recordings from disclosure \u201cuntil final disposition of any criminal or civil litigation which arises from the event,\u201d RCW 9.73.090(1)(c), would be a strange way to protect privacy. Privacy does not evaporate when litigation ends.\n\u00b625 Of course, we turn to extrinsic evidence of legislative intent only when the plain language of the statute does not answer the question. Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 9-10, 43 P.3d 4 (2002). In determining the plain meaning of a statute, we consider \u201call that the Legislature has said in the statute and related statutes which disclose legislative intent about the provision in question.\u201d Id. at 11. In this case, the statute as a whole suggests the legislative goal was neither to instill categorical delay nor protect personal privacy. Instead, the statute as a whole provides a limited exception to the rules against recording and the rules requiring disclosure to protect the integrity of law enforcement investigations and court proceedings. In authorizing \u201c[s]ound recordings that correspond to video images recorded [without all parties\u2019 consent] by video cameras mounted in law enforcement vehicles,\u201d RCW 9.73.090(1)(c), our legislature built on an exception to the privacy act that had for decades permitted recording of emergency calls and interviews of persons in custody. Laws of 1970, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 48; Laws of 2000, ch. 195. For decades the privacy act has admonished that these \u201crecordings shall only be used for valid police or court activities.\u201d Laws of 1970, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 48, \u00a7 l(2)(d) (codified at RCW 9.73.090(l)(b)(iv)). Context suggests that the legislature\u2019s intent in providing that \u201c[n]o sound or video recording made under this subsection (1)(c) may be duplicated and made available to the public by a law enforcement agency subject to this section until final disposition of any criminal or civil litigation which arises from the event or events which were recorded\u201d is to give more guidance to agencies attempting to limit their use of these recordings to \u201cvalid police or court activities,\u201d RCW 9.73-,090(1)(b)(iv). So long as \u201cpolice or court activities\u201d are ongoing, RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) restricts disclosure \u2014 most likely to protect those very \u201cpolice or court activities\u201d recited by the statute. Accord Sargent, 179 Wn.2d at 395. Neither the statutory text nor the legislative history suggests that categorical delay was legislative purpose. Delay was simply the means to an end \u2014 likely to avoid tainting pending litigation.\n\u00b626 KOMO contends that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is not an \u201cother statute\u201d exception to the PRA because it does not provide an alternative method of obtaining public records. Br. of Appellant at 34 (citing Deer v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. & Health Serv., 122 Wn. App. 84, 93 P.3d 195 (2004); In re Dependency of KB., 150 Wn. App. 912, 210 P.3d 330 (2009)). But while it was true that in both Deer and KB. there was an alternative statutory procedure to obtain records, neither case held that was a necessary factor.\n\u00b627 We hold that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is a limited exception to immediate disclosure under the PRA, but it is one that applies only where there is actual, pending litigation. We reverse and remand for further proceedings on this claim as well.\nConclusion\n\u00b628 We hold that SPD complied with the PRA when it declined Vedder\u2019s request for officer log sheets. We hold that SPD did not comply with the PRA when it failed to produce a list of retained videos. We hold that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) may exempt specific videos from public disclosure during the pendency of litigation but does not create a blanket exemption for any video that might be the subject of litigation. KOMO is entitled to attorney fees on the claims it prevailed on. We remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nC. Johnson, Stephens, and Gordon McCloud, JJ., and J.M. Johnson, J. Pro Tem., concur.\nVedder\u2019s declaration in support of KOMO\u2019s motion for summary judgment states that the request was submitted on August 4, 2010, as does Judge Rogers\u2019 order on cross motions for summary judgment. CP at 75, 535. The request was sent to SPD by e-mail late afternoon on August 3, 2010. CP at 95-96.\nLater, Judge Rogers clarified the penalty would accrue from the date the request was denied, not the date the materials were provided to Rachner. CP at 840-41.\nThese provisions make intercepting, recording, or divulging private communications unlawful, RCW 9.73.030; establish grounds for an ex parte court order authorizing interception, RCW 9.73.040; make unlawfully intercepted communications generally inadmissible in court, RCW 9.73.050; create a civil action for damages, RCW 9.73.060; exempt certain common carriers and 911 calls, RCW 9.73.070; and make violation of the act a gross misdemeanor, RCW 9.73.080.\nWe note that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is not a complete bar to release of videos pertaining to ongoing litigation. It does not bar release of videos to all parties involved in that litigation and may not be a bar to release pursuant to a court order.\nKOMO also contends that RCW 9.73.090(1)(e) does not qualify as an \u201cother statute exception\u201d because such other statutes \u201cmust exempt or prohibit disclosure of specific public records in their entirety.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 30 (citing Progressive Animal Welfare Soc\u2019y v. Univ. of Wash., 125 Wn.2d 243, 262, 884 P.2d 592 (1994) (PAWS)). This is based on a widespread, but mistaken, reading of that passage in PAWS. In that passage, we considered the University of Washington\u2019s contention that several other statutes exempted unfunded grant proposals from disclosure in their entirety, rather than merely allowed their redaction to protect specific information. PAWS, 125 Wn.2d at 261-62. We articulated a test to determine when that was so. Id. That test is not helpful for determining whether a specific statute creates any exception under the PRA but only for determining whether it exempts a record in its entirety. Notably, PAWS itself did not apply that test to determine whether the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, chapter 19.108 RCW, or an antiharassment statute, RCW 4.24.580, applied but simply looked to their plain language. 125 Wn.2d at 262-63.\nKOMO also argues that SPD violated the PRA by not providing a privilege log on the videos it did not disclose. Reply Br. of Appellant at 9 (citing RCW 42.56.210(3)). KOMO raised this in its complaint and summary judgment motion but did not assign error to the trial court\u2019s failure to reach it or otherwise address the issue in its opening brief. Given that, we decline to reach it. For similar reasons, we decline to reach whether SPD showed undue favoritism toward Rachner.",

        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b629 (concurring) \u2014 I agree with the majority\u2019s resolution of this case. In particular, I agree that RCW 9.73.090(l)(c) cannot be read to bar the release of the police dashboard camera (\u201cdash-cam\u201d) videos at issue here. I write separately to emphasize that the majority\u2019s analysis of how the Public Records Act (PRA), chapter 42.56 RCW, might apply if the conversations at issue here were private is unnecessary, because those conversations were not private at all.\n\u00b630 This court has clearly held that conversations between police officers and the drivers they stop are not private for purposes of the privacy act, chapter 9.73 RCW. Lewis v. Dep\u2019t of Licensing, 157 Wn.2d 446, 460, 139 P.3d 1078 (2006). So has the Court of Appeals. State v. Flora, 68 Wn. App. 802, 806, 845 P.2d 1355 (1992) (\u201cThe State urges us to adopt the view that public officers performing an official function on a public thoroughfare in the presence of a third party and within the sight and hearing of passersby enjoy a privacy interest which they may assert under the statute. We reject that view as wholly without merit.\u201d).\n\u00b631 For this reason, RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) cannot be characterized as a privacy protection at all. Hence, it is not an \u201cother statute\u201d designed to protect privacy that trumps the PRA\u2019s disclosure mandate. Instead, RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) must be read to bar the \u201claw enforcement agency\u201d from making a unilateral \u201cagency\u201d determination to release such recordings before litigation based on the subject of these recordings is final. RCW 9.73.090(1)(c). The law enforcement agency, however, has a duty to make a lawful, nonunilateral decision about disclosure. To comply with both its disclosure requirement and its RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) limitation, the law enforcement agency need only get advice from outside that agency \u2014 e.g., from the city attorney, the prosecuting attorney, or the attorney general \u2014 before making a decision to disclose.\nANALYSIS\nI. RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) Does Not Make Conversations between Law Enforcement Officers and the Drivers They Stop Private\n\u00b632 As discussed above, \u201cthis court and the Court of Appeals have repeatedly held that conversations with police officers are not private.\u201d Lewis, 157 Wn.2d at 460 (collecting cases).\n\u00b633 If the subject of the dash-cam video is not private for purposes of the privacy act, then it is hard to believe that the legislature limited the reproduction and distribution of such videos (via RCW 9.73.090(1)(c)) to protect privacy. Moreover, as the majority points out, the fact that that statute allows law enforcement officers to eventually distribute the recording to the public also undermines the claim that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) was enacted to protect anyone\u2019s privacy. See majority at 527 (\u201cPrivacy does not evaporate when litigation ends.\u201d). Finally, as this court has made clear, public records from a public agency that are available under court rules regarding discovery (including dash-cam videos, see Rules of Criminal Procedure (CrR) 4.7) are not exempt from disclosure under the PRA. O\u2019Connor v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. & Health Servs., 143 Wn.2d 895, 910, 25 P.3d 426 (2001); id. at 913 (Chambers, J., concurring). This also undermines the notion that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) was designed as a privacy exemption.\n\u00b634 The only natural reading of RCW 9.73.090(1)(c)\u2014 which is a separate paragraph tucked into a statute otherwise devoted to the different topic of permitting recordings \u2014 is that it is there to protect the right to a fair trial. (The City agrees. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 43-44 (\u201c[Police dashboard camera] recordings play a significant evidentiary role in civil and criminal litigation [,] and the Legislature recognized the impact that disclosure of recordings to the public could have if they were released before the subject of the recordings had an opportunity to fully adjudicate any criminal charges or civil claims related to the events that were recorded\u201d (citing Clerk\u2019s Papers at 487-88)).)\n\u00b635 Broad distribution of discovery of any sort prior to litigation can pose problems for the litigant, particularly for the criminal defendant, and the legislature is certainly entitled to adopt measures to try to protect the jury pool from taint. RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) seems like such a measure. It is directed to the \u201claw enforcement agency subject to this section,\u201d and it bars that \u201claw enforcement agency\u201d \u2014 but no one else \u2014 from certain dissemination. RCW 9.73.090(1)(c). It bars that agency\u2019s unilateral, unsupervised distribution of police recordings before the trial in which the recordings might become evidence (subject to \u201cfinal disposition\u201d), and it bars that \u201claw enforcement agency\u201d from \u201ccommercial\u201d distribution at any time. It makes sense that the legislature would do this to protect fair trials. Id.\nII. RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) Does Not Create an \u201cExemption\u201d from Disclosure\n\u00b636 The City, however, argues \u2014 and the majority partially agrees \u2014 that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) creates a statutory \u201cexemption\u201d from disclosure, per the language of RCW 42.56.070(1), trumping the PRA\u2019s disclosure mandate. Majority at 526.\n\u00b637 But the City doesn\u2019t really treat RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) as a true exemption from disclosure; \u201cexempt\u201d material is material that can never be disclosed. Instead, dash-cam videos are routinely released to individuals outside the \u201claw enforcement agency.\u201d RCW 9.73.090(1)(c). They are available to aid prosecutorial decision-making (which occurs outside the \u201claw enforcement agency\u201d). Id. They are available to criminal defense counsel and their agents (who work outside the \u201claw enforcement agency\u201d). Id. They are even available for admission into evidence in court. And despite the fact that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) says that these recordings cannot be made \u201cavailable to the public\u201d by the \u201claw enforcement agency,\u201d our courtrooms are, of course, open to the public and the press. All that reproduction and disclosure, including disclosure to the public at trial, occurs well before \u201cfinal disposition of any criminal or civil litigation which arises from the event . . . recorded.\u201d Id. And it probably also occurs long before the three-year time limit adopted by the agency (but not by the legislature) expires.\n\u00b638 Is all that distribution of dash-cam videos to prosecutors, defense counsel, juries, and public courtrooms unlawful or does it violate RCW 9.73.090(1)(c)? No one contends that this disclosure is unlawful, but why not? Why are dash-cam videos subject to disclosure in open court if RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) bars their public dissemination?\n\u00b639 The answer is that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) does not bar all public dissemination of dash-cam videos. Instead, the statute, by its plain language, applies only to the \u201claw enforcement agency subject to this section.\u201d RCW 9.73-.090(1)(c). It does not bar prosecutors from using them in open court \u2014 prosecutors are not the \u201claw enforcement agency subject to this statute.\u201d Id. It does not bar criminal defense lawyers from using them in open court \u2014 these lawyers are not the \u201claw enforcement agency\u201d either. Id. It does not bar judges from admitting them into evidence in open court or from entering an order to disclose them\u2014 judges are obviously not \u201claw enforcement agenc[ies].\u201d Id. And it certainly does not bar courts from adopting and enforcing rules compelling disclosure of recordings by \u201cvideo cameras mounted in law enforcement vehicles.\u201d Id.; see, e.g., CrR 4.7(a)-(e) (listing discoverable materials); Rules of Evidence (ER) 402 (relevant evidence admissible); Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963) (due process clause requires disclosure of any evidence favorable to the accused).\n\u00b640 That means that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is not an \u201cother statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records,\u201d creating a categorical \u201cexemption]\u201d from disclosure, at all. RCW 42.56.070(1) (emphasis added). It is, instead, a statute about who gets to decide whether to release dash-cam videos before \u201cfinal disposition.\u201d RCW 9.73.090(1)(c). It bars law enforcement agencies from making that decision unilaterally.\n\u00b641 This interpretation of RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is consistent with our prior case law, which holds that RCW 9.73.090 creates special rules applicable solely to police. We have held that police must strictly observe those rules, which require officers to notify drivers and arrested persons that they are being recorded \u201ceven though the conversations involved clearly were not private.\u201d Lewis, 157 Wn.2d at 465-66 (emphasis added).\nIII. Since RCW 42.56.070 Mandates Disclosure of Dash-Cam Videos of Law Enforcement Encounters with the Public and RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) Regulates Who Can Make the Disclosure Decision, the Law Enforcement Agency Must Turn to Counsel from outside That Agency\n\u00b642 If the duty to release dash-cam recordings (RCW 42.56.070) conflicted with the bar against law enforcement agencies making a decision to release these recordings, then the duty to release would prevail. RCW 42.56.030 (\u201cIn the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other act, the provisions of this chapter shall govern\u201d).\n\u00b643 But we have a duty to harmonize statutes, if possible. State v. Fagalde, 85 Wn.2d 730, 736-37, 539 P.2d 86 (1975) (citing Publishers Forest Prods. Co. v. State, 81 Wn.2d 814, 505 P.2d 453 (1973)). The two statutes at issue here can be harmonized if the \u201claw enforcement agency\u201d makes its decision based on advice of its counsel from outside that agency, rather than unilaterally. RCW 9.73-.090(1)(c). Such a requirement is in keeping with current practices; police departments and individual officers roufinely consult counsel such as the local city attorney. The outside-agency legal advisor would not be bound by RCW 9.73.090(1)(c)\u2019s procedural limits (though he or she would be bound to consider other exemptions). And, if the disclosure request ends up in court, the court is not bound by RCW 9.73.090(1)(c)\u2019s limit on \u201claw enforcement agenc[ies],\u201d either. Id.\n\u00b644 There will certainly be cases \u2014 and this could be one \u2014 in which a personal privacy interest could justify withholding dash-cam videos from the public. The PRA exempts from production \u201cspecific investigative records\u201d where nondisclosure \u201cis essential ... for the protection of any person\u2019s right to privacy.\u201d RCW 42.56.240(1). But this is not a categorical exemption. As with the exemption recently discussed in Sargent v. Seattle Police Department, this exemption requires the agency to justify nondisclosure on a case-by-case basis. 179 Wn.2d 376, 394, 314 P.3d 1093 (2013) (\u201cwhen an agency withholds internal investigation information citing the effective law enforcement exemption, the burden will rest with the agency to prove that specific portions of the internal file are essential to effective law enforcement\u201d).\n\u00b645 There could be other situations in which nondisclosure would be considered necessary to protect a defendant\u2019s fair trial right. See Seattle Times Co. v. Serko, 170 Wn.2d 581, 595-96, 243 P.3d 919 (2010) (listing factors for courts to consider when determining whether to compel nondisclosure to protect defendant\u2019s fair trial right). But that is not a categorical exemption, either. Id. at 596 (\u201cApplication of the standard should be done as to each record requested, with the trial court conducting an in camera review\u201d).\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b646 I therefore concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) does not create a blanket exemption from disclosure. I would add only that the trial court erred in interpreting RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) as an \u201cother statute\u201d that categorically exempts recordings from chapter 42.56 RCW\u2019s disclosure requirement.\nI mention the three-year time limit because it shows that even the agency adopting that limit acknowledges that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) permits distribution to the public at some point. I do not mention the three-year time limit to endorse it as lawful; the media amici have the better argument that \u201c[dietermining the scope of PRA exemptions is the purview of the courts, not the agency holding the records.\u201d Br. of Amici Curiae News Media Entities et al. at 5 (citing O\u2019Neill v. City of Shoreline, 170 Wn.2d 138, 149, 240 P.3d 1149 (2010); Hearst Corp. v. Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d 123, 130, 580 P.2d 246 (1978)).\nThe City asserts (in its brief responding to the Washington Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (WACDL)) that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is just like many other statutes that completely bar distribution of photos to the public even though the events captured were as public as the events captured by dash-cam videos. A review of the language of the statutes the City cites, though, shows that they use completely different language. They say that the videos and photos taken at tolls and similar places are completely private, not at all open to \u201cthe public,\u201d and that they cannot ever be distributed to the public except for the listed purposes. See Answer to Amicus Curiae WACDL at 12 (\u201cRCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is just one of several statutes restricting or prohibiting dissemination of law-enforcement videos and images. The Legislature authorizes photo toll systems but prohibits any public dissemination of the images. RCW 46.63.160(6)(c); RCW 47.56.795(2)(b); RCW 47.46.105(2)(b). Likewise, the statute authorizing traffic safety cameras at stoplights, railroad crossings, and school speed zones does not permit any public dissemination of the images. RCW 46.63.170(1)(g). These statutes are based on the nature of the recording rather than the place where it is recorded.\u201d).\nSee Lewis, 157 Wn.2d at 464-67 (\u201cthe legislature enacted the provisions in ... RCW 9.73.090(1)[(c)] ... so that police officers would comply with those provisions\u201d); State v.

        "text": "Fairhurst, J.\n\u00b647 (concurring in part/dissenting in part) \u2014 I agree with the majority that the trial court correctly concluded that the Seattle Police Department (SPD) did not violate the Public Records Act (PRA), chapter 42.56 RCW, by stating that it had no responsive records to Tracy Vedder\u2019s request for \u201c \u2018police officer\u2019s log sheets.\u2019 \u201d Majority at 522 (quoting Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 96). I also agree with the majority that the trial court correctly concluded SPD violated the PRA by stating that it had no responsive records to Vedder\u2019s request for \u201c \u2018a list of any and all digital in-car video/audio recordings.\u2019 \u201dId. at 523 (quoting CP at 98).\n\u00b648 I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that SPD violated the PRA by withholding the dashboard camera recordings requested by Vedder. The PRA requires state and local agencies to disclose public records upon request. An exemption to this requirement is a record that falls within an \u201cother statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records.\u201d RCW 42.56-.070(1). Under Washington\u2019s privacy act, chapter 9.73 RCW, police dashboard video recordings are not available to the public \u201cuntil final disposition of any criminal or civil litigation which arises from the event or events which were recorded.\u201d RCW 9.73.090(1)(c). The majority finds that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is an other statute but interprets the prohibition found in RCW 9.73.090(l)(c) as \u201climited to cases where the videos relate to actual, pending litigation.\u201d Majority at 526. While I agree that this provision creates an exemption to the PRA, I disagree with this limitation and rewriting of the statute. I would affirm the trial court on all grounds.\n\u00b649 The PRA is a \u201cstrongly worded mandate for broad disclosure of public records.\u201d Hearst Corp. v. Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d 123, 127, 580 P.2d 246 (1978). The PRA requires all state and local agencies to \u201cmake available for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of [the PRA] or other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records.\u201d RCW 42.56.070(1). That is to say, RCW 42.56.070(1) \u201cincorporates into the [PRA] other statutes which exempt or prohibit disclosure of specific information or records\u201d and that supplement, or do not conflict with, the PRA. Progressive Animal Welfare Soc\u2019y v. Univ. of Wash., 125 Wn.2d 243, 261-62, 884 P.2d 592 (1994) (citing former RCW 42.17.260(1) (1992), recodified as RCW 42.56-.070, Laws of 2005, ch. 274, \u00a7 103).\n\u00b650 RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) specifically prohibits disclosure of video recordings to \u201cthe public\u201d and prohibits disclosure to the public \u201cuntil final disposition of any criminal or civil litigation.\u201d See WAC 44-14-06002(1) (distinguishing \u201cexemption\u201d from \u201cprohibit[ion]\u201d on the grounds that an agency has the discretion to disclose exempt public records, but an agency has no discretion to disclose records that are confidential or prohibited from disclosure). RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) does not conflict with the PRA and prohibits disclosure of specific public records in their entirety. Thus, we agree with the majority that RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is an other statute that operates as an exception to the PRA, prohibiting disclosure of in-car law enforcement video recordings.\n\u00b651 However, we disagree with the majority as to the scope of the exemption. The majority limits the prohibition to \u201ccases where the videos relate to actual, pending litigation.\u201d Majority at 526. The majority imposes this limitation citing the proposition that an exemption or disclosure prohibition found in a supplemental statute should be narrowly interpreted to maintain the PRA\u2019s goal of free and open examination of public records. Sargent v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 179 Wn.2d 376, 386-87, 314 P.3d 1093 (2013). While we agree that a court should interpret other statute exemptions narrowly, the court must still interpret the other statute in good faith and may not impose an improperly narrow interpretation simply to reach a desired result. The majority improperly interprets the exemption too narrowly, essentially rewriting the statute in a way that is contrary to legislative intent and the statutory language itself.\n\u00b652 \u201cThe goal of statutory interpretation is to discern and implement the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d State v. Armendariz, 160 Wn.2d 106, 110, 156 P.3d 201 (2007) (citing State v. J.P., 149 Wn.2d 444, 450, 69 P.3d 318 (2003)). \u201cIn interpreting a statute, this court looks first to its plain language.\u201d Id. \u201cIf the plain language of the statute is unambiguous, then this court\u2019s inquiry is at an end.\u201d Id. We need not go beyond the plain language in this case to see the majority\u2019s limitation of the prohibition to \u201cactual, pending litigation\u201d is unduly narrow. Majority at 526.\n\u00b653 The language of RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) prohibits disclosing the video recordings to the public until \u201cfinal disposition of any criminal or civil litigation.\u201d \u201cFinal disposition\u201d could mean entry of final judgment by a trial court or the exhaustion of appellate remedies. Id. Litigation might also be final when the possibility of litigation is foreclosed by a statute of limitations or other procedural mechanism. Although \u201cfinal disposition\u201d can be \u201creasonably interpreted in more than one way,\u201d it is not ambiguous \u201csimply because different interpretations are conceivable.\u201d State v. Watson, 146 Wn.2d 947, 955, 51 P.3d 66 (2002) (citing State v. Keller, 143 Wn.2d 267, 276, 19 P.3d 1030 (2001)).\n\u00b654 The meaning of \u201cany\u201d is clearer. The word \u201cany\u201d has been given broad and inclusive connotations. State v. Sutherby, 165 Wn.2d 870, 880-81, 204 P.3d 916 (2009) (citing Rosenoff v. Cross, 95 Wash. 525, 527, 164 P. 236 (1917)); State ex rel. Evans v. Bhd. of Friends, 41 Wn.2d 133, 145, 247 P.2d 787 (1952) (the state constitution\u2019s prohibition on legislative authority to authorize any lottery or grant any divorce was unambiguously phrased in the broadest sense). The word is not limited by specific reference to a point in time. Rosenoff, 95 Wash. at 528 (\u201cThe words \u2018theretofore\u2019 and \u2018any\u2019 are broad and inclusive as to time and subject-matter. They negat[e] any intention to make only the violation of existing law a disqualification.\u201d). The meaning of the phrase \u201cany order\u201d has been held to be \u201c \u2018so plain as to admit of no argument as to the[ ] meaning.\u2019 \u201d State ex rel. Tacoma E. R.R. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, 102 Wash. 589, 591, 173 P. 626 (1918) (quoting State ex rel. Great N. Ry. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, 76 Wash. 625, 627, 137 P. 132 (1913) (citing State ex rel. R.R. Comm\u2019n v. Or. R.R. & Navigation Co., 68 Wash. 160, 123 P. 3 (1912))). In State ex rel. Tacoma Eastern Railroad, we emphasized that \u201cany\u201d must mean \u201call\u201d because if it meant anything less, the legislature would have said as much. 102 Wash. at 591-92 (\u201c[W]e are constrained to hold that the legislature, in using the words \u2018any order,\u2019 meant all orders, unless they had specifically excepted therefrom certain orders or class of orders in the foregoing statutes.\u201d). This case law demonstrates that there is a uniform, consistent, and thus plain meaning for the widely used term \u201cany.\u201d So we reaffirm Washington precedent and interpret \u201c \u2018any' to mean \u2018every\u2019 or \u2018all.\u2019 \u201d Sutherby, 165 Wn.2d at 881 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Smith, 117 Wn.2d 263, 271 & n.8, 814 P.2d 652 (1991)); State v. Westling, 145 Wn.2d 607, 611, 40 P.3d 669 (2002); Smith, 117 Wn.2d at 271 (\u201cWashington courts have repeatedly construed the word \u2018an/ to mean \u2018every\u2019 and \u2018all.\u2019 \u201d).\n\u00b655 Although the \u201cfinal disposition\u201d language can be reasonably interpreted in more than one way, none of those ways equate \u201cany\u201d to \u201cactual\u201d and \u201cpending\u201d litigation. Furthermore, the stated purpose of RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is to prohibit the disclosure of police dashboard video recordings. Requiring law enforcement to publicly disclose dashboard video recordings upon request \u2014 except when there is actual, pending litigation \u2014 is directly in contradiction to the purpose and language of the statute, i.e., to prohibit public disclosure until final disposition of any criminal or civil litigation. Under the majority\u2019s theory, one need only ask for the recordings the day before filing the suit when there was no actual or pending litigation, which would obliterate the purpose of the statute. This court must enforce statutes \u201cin accordance with [their] plain meaning,\u201d and the plain meaning does not limit disclosure only to cases with filed lawsuits. Armendariz, 160 Wn.2d at 110.\n\u00b656 Washington\u2019s privacy act aims to protect citizens from having their private conversations recorded without their consent. See RCW 9.73.030. However, the legislature carved out some exceptions to this rule, including allowing police officers to record interactions with citizens with an in car video camera. RCW 9.73.090. In the same provision where it created the exception to the privacy act, the legislature included language preventing such videos from public disclosure. The plain interpretation of this language in the context of the privacy act is that the legislature created the exception to retain some of the privacy rights of the citizen who was videotaped by the police. The majority insists that the real legislative goal was to protect the integrity of law enforcement investigations and court proceedings but makes this inference from looking at the historical development of the provision. Majority at 527-28. When the plain reading of a statute is clear, inferences and historical trends have no place. See Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 9-11, 43 P.3d 4 (2002). An intent to exclude these videos from disclosure to retain the privacy of the citizens is clear from the text of the present statutory scheme, and the inquiry should end there.\n\u00b657 The trial court and KOMO expressed concern about SPD\u2019s policy of destroying dashboard video recordings after three years \u2014 the same length of time as the statute of limitations for civil tort claims. It is conceivable that under this policy, SPD could destroy a recording before the recording would be subject to disclosure under RCW 9.73-,090(1)(c). This hypothetical situation is not enough, however, to make RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) ambiguous. See Watson, 146 Wn.2d at 955 (The courts \u201care not \u2018obliged to discern any ambiguity by imagining a variety of alternative interpretations.\u2019 \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Keller, 143 Wn.2d 267, 276-77, 19 P.3d 1030 (2001))). Moreover, KOMO\u2019s concerns are unfounded because, under RCW 42.56.100, an agency is prohibited from destroying records scheduled for destruction if the agency receives a public record request \u201cat a time when such record exists.\u201d If such a request is made, the agency \u201cmay not destroy or erase the record until the request is resolved.\u201d Id.; see also O\u2019Neill v. City of Shoreline, 170 Wn.2d 138, 149, 240 P.3d 1149 (2010) (\u201c[T]he PRA does not allow agencies to destroy records that are subject to a pending records request.\u201d). Nothing prevents KOMO from making a public records request and from eventually obtaining dashboard video camera recordings. But KOMO, like other members of the public, must adhere to the delayed disclosure requirements of RCW 9.73.090(1)(c).\n\u00b658 RCW 9.73.090 is an other statute that operates as an exemption to the PRA. The plain language of this statute instructs that in car video recordings should not be released to the public until final disposition of any criminal or civil litigation. The SPD retains any video that might be the subject of litigation for three years, and if no litigation has been filed by that time, the video may be destroyed. The legislature has determined that three years is sufficient time either for litigation to be commenced or for the SPD to be sure none will be filed regarding that video. Since the statute plainly requires any litigation regarding an in car video to be final before any public disclosure, this three year time period is a logical application that ensures compliance with the statute.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b659 RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is an other statute that exempts or prohibits public disclosure of specific information. RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is not in conflict with the PRA and specifically prohibits public disclosure of police dashboard video camera recordings in their entirety until final disposition of any criminal or civil litigation. The majority\u2019s overly narrow interpretation of RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) is contrary to the legislature\u2019s intent to prohibit public disclosure of police dashboard video camera recordings until final disposition of any criminal or civil litigation, which is clear from the plain language of the statute. Although \u201cfinal disposition\u201d has a couple of reasonable interpretations, no interpretation supports concluding that it means \u201cactual, pending litigation.\u201d Majority at 526.1 would affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that SPD did not violate the PRA by withholding the video recordings requested by Vedder.\nMadsen, C.J., and Owens and Wiggins, JJ., concur with Fairhurst, J.\nWhile RCW 9.73.090(1)(c) prohibits disclosure to the public, it does not prohibit disclosure of police dashboard video camera recordings to \u201call parties involved in ... litigation [relating to the substance of the recording]\u201d or disclosure \u201cpursuant to a court order.\u201d Majority at 526 n.4. I would add that if criminal charges are brought against the subjects of such videos, police are required to make such videos available to the subject\u2019s counsel under RCW 9.73.100.",

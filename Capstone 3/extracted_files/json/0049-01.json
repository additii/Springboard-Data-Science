        "text": "Yu, J.\n\u00b61 Petitioner Clark Stuhr is in Department of Corrections (DOC) custody, serving two consecutive sentences imposed pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), chapter 9.94A RCW. As penalties for Stuhr\u2019s serious disciplinary infractions, DOC has revoked potentially available good conduct time for both of his sentences. Stuhr contends that this loss of potential good conduct time violates statutory and constitutional law. We disagree and therefore deny relief on his personal restraint petition (PRP).\nBACKGROUND\n\u00b62 Stuhr pleaded guilty to first degree murder in 1989 and was given an exceptional sentence of 425 months. In 1991, he was convicted of second degree assault and given a 17-month sentence to run consecutively with his 1989 murder sentence. Pursuant to the SRA, Stuhr is eligible to have each of his sentences reduced by up to one-third. RCW 9.94A.729(3)(e). Stuhr has committed a number of serious disciplinary infractions while incarcerated, including assaults, throwing objects, and destroying property. DOC has revoked potentially available good conduct time for both of Stuhr\u2019s sentences as penalties for his infractions.\n\u00b63 Stuhr does not challenge the substantive or procedural validity of any of his underlying infractions, and he does not argue that DOC violated any applicable provisions of the Washington Administrative Code or DOC policy manual. Instead, he argues that RCW 9.94A.729(1)(a) prohibits the loss of potential good conduct time on a prospective basis. In the alternative, he contends that he has a protected liberty interest in his potential good conduct time and was not afforded due process before losing it, as required by the state and federal constitutions. See Wash. Const. art. I, \u00a7 3; U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV.\n\u00b64 The acting chief judge for the Court of Appeals dismissed Stuhr\u2019s PRP. Order Dismissing Pet., In re Pers. Restraint of Stuhr, No. 46988-0-II, at 2 (Wash. Ct. App. June 24, 2015). This court granted Stuhr\u2019s motion for discretionary review and appointed counsel to represent him. Order Granting Review, In re Pers. Restraint of Stuhr, No. 91920-8 (Wash. Dec. 2, 2015).\nISSUES\n\u00b65 A. Does the SRA prohibit the loss of potentially available good conduct time as a penalty for serious disciplinary infractions?\n\u00b66 B. Has Stuhr shown that he has a protected liberty interest in potential good conduct time and that he was not afforded due process before losing it?\nANALYSIS\n\u00b67 Stuhr has not had a prior opportunity to judicially appeal the issues presented in his PRP, so he need not make any threshold showing of prejudice; he must show only that he is under an unlawful restraint as defined by RAP 16.4. In re Pers. Restraint of Grantham, 168 Wn.2d 204, 214, 227 P.3d 285 (2010). Stuhr\u2019s incarceration is clearly a \u201c \u2018restraint,\u2019 \u201d RAP 16.4(b), so we consider only whether the loss of potential good conduct time as a disciplinary penalty is \u201cunlawful,\u201d RAP 16.4(c). See In re Pers. Restraint of Pullman, 167 Wn.2d 205, 211, 218 P.3d 913 (2009). We conclude that Stuhr has not shown any statutory or constitutional violations, and he does not allege any administrative violations. He has thus not shown that he is under an unlawful restraint.\nA. Early release pursuant to the SRA and DOC policy\n\u00b68 The SRA contemplates that an offender may be released from total confinement before serving the full sentence imposed by the court. This is accomplished through \u201cearned release time,\u201d which may be granted \u201cfor good behavior and good performance\u201d while the offender is in custody. RCW 9.94A.729(1)(a). Policies and procedures for earned release time are \u201cdeveloped and adopted by the correctional agency having jurisdiction in which the offender is confined.\u201d Id. The SRA gives correctional agencies a high level of discretion to determine whether and how to reward good behavior and good performance with early release. In re Pers. Restraint of Williams, 121 Wn.2d 655, 661, 853 P.2d 444 (1993). Correctional agencies are not required to grant the maximum allowable earned release time. Pullman, 167 Wn.2d at 214.\n\u00b69 DOC policy divides earned release time into two categories\u2014\u201cearned time\u201d and \u201cgood conduct time.\u201d WAC 137-30-020 (formatting omitted); DOC Policy 350.100, at 2. Only good conduct time is at issue in this case. Good conduct time is the \u201cgood behavior\u201d component of RCW 9.94A.729(1)(a). DOC Policy 350.100, at 4. It is presumptively available for any nonmandatory portions of the offender\u2019s sentence, subject to exceptions not relevant here. Id. at 3-4. Good conduct time may be lost when an offender is \u201cfound guilty of a serious violation\u201d of prison disciplinary rules. Id. at 4. Subject to certain limitations, lost good conduct time may be restored by complying with an approved \u201crestoration plan.\u201d Id. at 9.\nB. Prospective loss of good conduct time is not prohibited by statute\n\u00b610 Stuhr\u2019s statutory argument relies on RCW 9.94A.729(1)(a), which provides that \u201c [t] he correctional agency shall not credit the offender with earned release credits in advance of the offender actually earning the credits.\u201d Stuhr reads this statutory provision as requiring good conduct time to be earned on an ongoing basis. Therefore, he contends, good conduct time does not exist before it is earned, and something that does not exist cannot be taken away. We disagree with Stuhr\u2019s interpretation of RCW 9.94A.729(1)(a).\n\u00b611 In fact, Stuhr\u2019s reading inverts the plain language of the statute, which clearly limits the extent to which correctional agencies may grant earned release time; it does not purport to limit a correctional agency\u2019s authority to withhold earned release time. While DOC does calculate how much good conduct time is potentially available to an offender when he or she enters DOC custody, nothing about this initial calculation unlawfully \u201ccredit [s] the offender with earned release credits in advance of the offender actually earning the credits.\u201d Id. It simply determines the maximum potentially available good conduct time allowed by the SRA. At oral argument, counsel described DOC\u2019s initial calculation with the following useful analogy:\nI think of good conduct time as a stack of plastic chips ... [and] that good conduct time can be calculated at the beginning of the sentence. The inmate can calculate it, the Department can calculate it, it\u2019s two-thirds of the potential earned release time\u2014that\u2019s the way it works. So let\u2019s suppose it\u2019s a thousand chips. The inmate walks into the prison. At the end of the road down there, at the end of his sentence somewhere, is a thousand chips waiting for him. Each one of those chips represents a day less time that he is going to have to serve if he behaves throughout the course of his sentence. Now, he is told . . . we\u2019re using those chips to calculate when your actual release date will be, and between now and then, if you misbehave, you\u2019re going to lose some of those chips. They\u2019re there waiting for you, but you\u2019re going to lose some of them. And as you go through, you might be able to get some of those back. But we\u2019re going to use those chips as a tool to decide when your earned release date is. So he has no present right to those chips\u2014he can\u2019t say I want all my chips now. He has\u2014he doesn\u2019t earn those chips as he goes through month by month, day by day. In other states, he might, but not in Washington.\nWash. Supreme Court oral argument, In re Pers. Restraint of Stuhr, No. 91920-8 (May 12, 2016), at 22 min., 2 sec. through 23 min., 18 sec., audio recording by TVW, Washington State\u2019s Public Affairs Network, http://www.tvw.org.\n\u00b612 Consistent with this description, we have previously observed that \u201cthe critical feature of [DOC\u2019s calculation of potential earned released time] is that it is not based upon the amount of time the offender is incarcerated. Instead, the allowable good time is calculated based upon one-third of the sentence imposed .\u201d Williams, 121 Wn.2d at 659. For this reason, Stuhr\u2019s reliance on State ex rel. Bailey v. State, 213 W. Va. 563, 584 S.E.2d 197 (2003), is misplaced. The West Virginia statute at issue in that case provided that an inmate would accrue good time credit on an ongoing basis \u201c \u2018for each day he or she is incarcerated.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 202 (quoting W. Va. Code \u00a7 28-5-27(c)); cf. Nichols v. Warren, 209 Conn. 191, 550 A.2d 309, 312 (1988) (applying Connecticut law). Stuhr points to no comparable language in Washington\u2019s SRA.\n\u00b613 To the extent Stuhr argues that this court should adopt his statutory interpretation based on policy considerations, we decline. The legislature has tasked correctional agencies with determining how best to promote the rehabilitative and disciplinary purposes of early release. Williams, 121 Wn.2d at 661-62. This court is ill suited to make such determinations, and because the plain language of the SRA does not prohibit the loss of potential good conduct time as a disciplinary penalty, we defer to DOC policy. See Bostain v. Food Express, Inc., 159 Wn.2d 700, 716, 153 P.3d 846 (2007). Stuhr has thus not shown that his restraint is unlawful as a matter of statutory law.\nC. Stuhr does not show that he was denied due process\n\u00b614 Stuhr contends that if we reject his statutory argument, then he has a protected liberty interest in his potentially available good conduct time and did not receive due process before losing it. This argument is foreclosed by our precedent.\n\u00b615 \u201cThe threshold question in every due process challenge is whether the challenger has been deprived of a protected interest in life, liberty, or property.\u201d Pullman, 167 Wn.2d at 211-12. In Pullman, this court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim that \u201cDOC violated his right to due process when it raised his risk classification to a level at which he was unable to earn a 50 percent reduction in his sentence without advance notice or a hearing.\u201d Id. at 211. We noted that the SRA statutes governing early release do not \u201ccreate any expectation of a specific release date or a specific classification level\u201d and instead give DOC \u201cbroad discretion to determine and enforce the procedures by which an offender will be allowed to earn a reduction in his sentence.\u201d Id. at 214. We also distinguished between early release pursuant to the SRA, which does not create a protected liberty interest, and parole pursuant to the prior indeterminate sentencing scheme, which does. Id. at 215 (citing Monohan v. Burdman, 84 Wn.2d 922, 530 P.2d 334 (1975)).\n\u00b616 Stuhr attempts to distinguish this case from Pullman, but his constitutional argument is based on the same premise as his statutory argument\u2014that DOC\u2019s initial calculation effectively awards good conduct time up front, when the offender first enters DOC custody. As discussed above, however, Stuhr misreads the statute and DOC policy. He also points to no substantive statutory limitations that would give an offender a legitimate expectation of early release based on DOC\u2019s initial calculation of the maximum potential good conduct time allowed by the SRA. This is fatal to his constitutional claim because \u201c[f ] or a state law to create a liberty interest, it must contain \u2018substantive predicates\u2019 to the exercise of discretion and \u2018specific directives to the decisionmaker that if the regulations\u2019 substantive predicates are present, a particular outcome must follow\u2019.\u201d In re Pers. Restraint of Cashaw, 123 Wn.2d 138, 144, 866 P.2d 8 (1994) (quoting Ky. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 463, 109 S. Ct. 1904, 104 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1989)).\n\u00b617 Finally, even if Stuhr did have a protected liberty interest in his potential good conduct time, it is not clear what process Stuhr believes was due to him but not provided. He does not allege, and the record does not indicate, that he was denied any of the minimal due process protections that may be required in the prison disciplinary context. See Grantham, 168 Wn.2d at 215-16. Stuhr is therefore not entitled to relief or a reference hearing on his constitutional claim.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b618 Stuhr does not show that the loss of his potential good conduct time as a penalty for serious disciplinary infractions is an unlawful restraint as a matter of either statutory or constitutional law. We therefore deny relief on his PRP.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Gordon McCloud, JJ., concur.",

        "text": "Owens, J.\n\u00b61 Robbery and theft are closely related crimes. While both offenses involve stealing money or property, theft is elevated to robbery where the defendant uses force or threatened force to take the property. The main question in this case is whether certain conduct constituted a \u201cthreat of force,\u201d making the crime a robbery, not a theft. The legislature has broadly defined \u201cthreat\u201d to specifically include \u201cindirect [ ]\u201d threats. RCW 9A.04-.110(28). We have established in our case law that a threat need not be explicit to qualify\u2014a threat can be implied by words or conduct. As we recently held, where an ordinary person could reasonably infer a threat of harm from the defendant\u2019s conduct, the defendant made an implied threat of force. State v. Witherspoon, 180 Wn.2d 875, 884, 329 P.3d 888 (2014). Today, we are asked to decide whether, under the circumstances here, respondent Charles Farnsworth\u2019s handwritten note demanding money from a bank teller contained an implied threat of force.\n\u00b62 Although the note did not convey an explicitly threatening message, we believe it was laden with inherent intimidation. When a person demands money at a bank, with no explanation or indication of lawful entitlement to money, it can imply a threat of force because without such a threat, the teller would have no incentive to comply. An ordinary bank teller could reasonably infer an implied threat of harm under these circumstances. Because of this implicit threat, banks have security guards and distinctive policies in place to prevent harm flowing from precisely these types of encounters. As Farnsworth\u2019s partner in crime explained, they were well aware that banks generally instructed their employees to react to such notes as if they contained an explicit threat; in fact, the pair relied on that knowledge and fear to commit this crime. In this context, we hold that there is sufficient evidence that the pair\u2019s conduct implied a threat of harm.\n\u00b63 Additionally, Farnsworth asks us to find that cumulative trial court errors deprived him of a fair trial. We find that no errors accumulated to deprive Farnsworth of a fair trial. Consequently, we affirm Farnsworth\u2019s conviction for first degree robbery.\nFACTS\n\u00b64 On October 15, 2009, Farnsworth and James McFarland were suffering heroin withdrawals and had no money to purchase more drugs. The pair made a plan to \u201crob\u201d a bank. 13 Report of Proceedings (RP) at 1208. The plan was for McFarland to wait outside in the car while Farnsworth entered a bank, wearing a wig and sunglasses as a disguise, and retrieved money. Farnsworth would present the note to the teller, which read, \u201cNo die [sic] packs, no tracking devices, put the money in the bag.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 34.\n\u00b65 Farnsworth was \u201chem and hawing\u201d while driving around, and McFarland grew increasingly frustrated with him until he finally reached his breaking point. 13 RP at 1233. He grabbed the wig and note from Farnsworth\u2019s hands and entered the bank to carry out their plan. While Farnsworth waited outside in the car, McFarland approached a teller\u2019s counter, leaned through her window, and handed her the note. The teller, Sarah Van Zuyt, testified that she instantly knew she was being robbed when she read the note. She said she was \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cin shock.\u201d 9 RP at 484. Ms. Van Zuyt complied with the demand \u201c[ble-cause I didn\u2019t want anybody else to get harmed, and I didn\u2019t know what he was capable of doing.\u201d Id. at 486. She handed him about $300 in small bills, and McFarland left. Farns-worth and McFarland drove away, but they were pulled over and arrested a few blocks from the bank.\n\u00b66 Both Farnsworth and McFarland were charged with first degree robbery pursuant to RCW 9A.56.200(l)(b) (robbery committed in a financial institution). Farnsworth faced the possibility of a life sentence under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA) of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 if convicted of this robbery, as he was previously convicted of a 2004 robbery and a 1984 vehicular homicide in California. Ch. 9.94A RCW. The POAA requires a life sentence when a repeat offender commits a third felony that is classified as a \u201cmost serious offense\u201d (often referred to as a \u201cthird strike\u201d). RCW 9.94A.570, .030(33), (38).\n\u00b67 Likewise, McFarland faced a life sentence under the POAA, as he also had prior convictions of crimes classified as most serious offenses. He agreed to a plea bargain for an 8- to 10-year sentence instead of a life sentence, whereby McFarland would testify against Farnsworth in Farns-worth\u2019s jury trial for robbery. McFarland agreed to testify against Farnsworth after Farnsworth acted rudely toward McFarland while staying at Western State Hospital following arrest. 15 RP at 1430-31.\n\u00b68 The jury was instructed on both first degree theft and first degree robbery; it unanimously convicted Farnsworth of first degree robbery, and, per the jury instructions, it did not consider the lesser-included crime of first degree theft. The trial court found that the conviction was his third strike under the POAA and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of release.\n\u00b69 Farnsworth appealed, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support robbery because (1) there was no threat of force and (2) he agreed to aid only a theft, not a robbery Division Two of the Court of Appeals agreed, vacated his robbery conviction, and remanded to the trial court for sentencing on first degree theft. State v. Farnsworth, 184 Wn. App. 305, 314, 348 P.3d 759 (2014) (published in part). Farnsworth also argued that he was deprived of a fair trial under the cumulative error doctrine, raising six claimed errors. In the unpublished portion of its opinion, the Court of Appeals found only one suspect error, which it deemed harmless. State v. Farnsworth, No. 43167-0-II, slip op. (unpublished portion) at 14, 19 (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 28, 2014). Although raised by Farnsworth, the Court of Appeals did not reach the issue of whether his earlier out-of-state conviction counted as a strike for purposes of the POAA because once his robbery conviction was vacated, the POAA was not implicated. Id. at 20.\n\u00b610 The State petitioned this court for review, arguing that the Court of Appeals erred in finding insufficient evidence of a threat and of Farnsworth\u2019s accomplice liability. Farnsworth cross petitioned, again raising five of his claimed trial court errors and claiming his California conviction should not count as a strike for purposes of the POAA. We granted discretionary review of both the petition and cross petition. State v. Farnsworth, 183 Wn.2d 1001, 349 P.3d 856 (2015).\nISSUES\n\u00b611 1. Was there sufficient evidence of a threat of force under these circumstances?\n\u00b612 2. Does the evidence show that Farnsworth had the requisite knowledge to be liable as an accomplice to robbery?\n\u00b613 3. Do Farnsworth\u2019s claimed trial court errors warrant reversal of his conviction?\n\u00b614 4. Does Farnsworth\u2019s out-of-state conviction compare to a strike for purposes of sentencing under the POAA?\nANALYSIS\n1. Sufficient Evidence Supports an Implied Threat of Force under These Circumstances\n\u00b615 We are first asked to decide whether there was sufficient evidence of a threat of force during the crime. Specifically, the State asks us to reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 finding that the use of the demand note here was insufficient to show any implicit or explicit threat of force. For the reasons explained below, we hold that under these circumstances\u2014including the use of a demand note with no claim of legal entitlement to the money, the note\u2019s reference to dye packs, and the defendants\u2019 awareness that banking personnel would treat the note as a threat\u2014there was sufficient evidence of an implied threat of force.\n\u00b616 In a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we must examine the record to determine whether any rational finder of fact could have found that the State proved each element beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Green, 94 Wn.2d 216, 221, 616 P.2d 628 (1980) (plurality opinion). When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, he or she admits the truth of all of the State\u2019s evidence. State v. Homan, 181 Wn.2d 102, 106, 330 P.3d 182 (2014). In such cases, appellate courts view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, drawing reasonable inferences in the State\u2019s favor. Id. Circumstantial and direct evidence are to be considered equally reliable. State v. Thomas, 150 Wn.2d 821, 874, 83 P.3d 970 (2004).\n\u00b617 At issue in this case is whether there was sufficient evidence of a threat of force during the crime. That is because the distinguishing element between robbery and theft is the use or threatened use of force. Robbery is committed when a person unlawfully takes the property of another \u201cby the use or threatened use of immediate force, violence, or fear of injury to that person . . . RCW 9A-.56.190. Theft, on the other hand, does not require any use of force. It is simply the wrongful taking of the property of another with intent to deprive him or her of such property. RCW 9A.56.020(l)(a).\n\u00b618 Washington\u2019s criminal code defines \u201cthreat\u201d as \u201cto communicate, directly or indirectly [,] the intent\u201d to take a certain action. RCW 9A.04.110(28) (emphasis added). In many robberies, the threat of force is explicit. For instance, a robber might directly communicate to a teller, \u201cHand over the money, or I will shoot you.\u201d Other times, the threat is clearly implied by conduct, such as pointing a gun at a bank teller and simply stating, \u201cGive me the money.\u201d At issue in this case is whether, under the circumstances, the demand note given to the teller contained an indirect communication of implied threat of force.\n\u00b619 We recently considered an implied threat in Wither-spoon and articulated an objective standard to determine if the defendant used intimidation to take property: we ask if \u201can ordinary person in the victim\u2019s position could reasonably infer a threat of bodily harm from the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d 180 Wn.2d at 884. There, the victim returned home to find an unknown car in her driveway and Witherspoon at the side of her home. Id. at 881. His left hand was behind his back. Id. The victim asked what he had behind his back, and he replied that he had a pistol. Id. He then drove away. Id. Applying the objective standard above to these facts, this court found that a rational jury could infer that Wither-spoon made an implied threat of force when he told her he had a pistol, despite the fact that he did not brandish a weapon. Id. at 885.\n\u00b620 Unlike in Witherspoon, Farnsworth and McFarland did not state that they had a weapon. But some lower Washington courts have found that a demand note presented to a bank contains an implied threat based on the social and historical context of bank robberies. For instance, the Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court\u2019s ruling that a person demanding money from a teller communicated an implied threat because it was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d for a bank teller to fear harm in the circumstances, even though no explicit threat was made. State v. Collinsworth, 90 Wn. App. 546, 551, 966 P.2d 905 (1997). Division One explained, \u201cNo matter how calmly expressed, an unequivocal demand for the immediate surrender of the bank\u2019s money, unsupported by even the pretext of any lawful entitlement to the funds, is fraught with the implicit threat to use force.\u201d Id. at 553.\n\u00b621 Division Two also found an implicit threat when a person handed a bank teller demand notes that contained statements such as \u201c This is a robbery,\u2019\u201d \u201cTut $3,000 in envelopes,\u2019\u201d and \u201cT will be watching you.\u2019\u201d State v. Shcherenkov, 146 Wn. App. 619, 622-23, 191 P.3d 99 (2008). Twice, the defendant kept his hand in his pocket, but he never brandished a weapon or even spoke to the teller. Id. The bank tellers said they felt threatened and that they complied to avoid harm to others. Id. Division Two found that a rational jury could reasonably interpret an implied threat from his hand in his pocket and the text of the notes. Id. at 629.\n\u00b622 We find the reasoning of these courts to be persuasive. Under Witherspoon\u2019s objective test, the facts here support a finding that a reasonable person in the teller\u2019s position could reasonably infer a threat of bodily harm. Just as Witherspoon knew that if he told the victim he had a gun she would let him leave with her belongings, Farnsworth and McFarland knew that a bank teller would comply with whatever they wrote in the note if they conveyed a threat. McFarland testified, \u201c[W]henever you\u2019re robbing a bank, bank tellers are supposed to do exactly what you told them. Because they want to get somebody out of there. They figure the danger or potential danger to the place.\u201d 14 RP at 1254. They knew if the note conveyed a serious demand, it would imply a threat of force that would compel compliance. The dissenting judge on the Court of Appeals reasoned, \u201cIndeed, without the implicit threat to use force, it is difficult to imagine why the teller would comply with the note\u2019s demand for money.\u201d Farnsworth, 184 Wn. App. at 316-17 (Worswick, J., dissenting in part).\n\u00b623 In fact, the teller did feel threatened. She said she \u201cknew [she] was getting robbed\u201d instantly upon reading the note and complied to avoid anyone getting hurt. 9 RP at 482, 486. An ordinary person in her position could likewise reasonably infer that McFarland threatened to use force, as McFarland made no attempt to feign lawful entitlement to the money and instead demonstrated an unlawful intent by ordering her not to include dye packs in the money.\n\u00b624 The note read, \u201cNo die [sic] packs, no tracking devices, put the money in the bag.\u201d CP at 34. While this note does not imply McFarland had a weapon, his words conveyed a threat. As the Court of Appeals in Collinsworth explained, demanding that a teller not include dye packs with the money \u201cunderscored] the seriousness of his intent.\u201d 90 Wn. App. at 553.\n\u00b625 Additionally, the evidence shows that Farnsworth and McFarland planned to commit a \u201crobbery.\u201d When their drug money ran out, McFarland testified that \u201c[Farns-worth\u2019s] talking about doing this robbery. And I said, well, I\u2019ll go with you on it. And we\u2019d go in and I\u2019d drive. He was supposed to do the robbery and I was supposed to drive.\u201d 13 RP at 1207. Although the Court of Appeals essentially dismissed the pair\u2019s use of the term \u201crobbery,\u201d calling it a colloquialism \u201csimilar to people saying their house was robbed when they really meant it was burglarized,\u201d Farnsworth, 184 Wn. App. at 310 n.5, their use of the term was significant because they acknowledged the differences between the terms. In his testimony, McFarland\u2019s use of various terms was not accidental: he distinguished between robbery and \u201cboosting,\u201d which he likened to \u201cshoplifting\u201d or stealing. 13 RP at 1205; 14 RP at 1277. McFarland\u2019s word choice illustrates his intent to commit a robbery in the bank, as opposed to the crime of theft.\n\u00b626 Under these circumstances, the defendants\u2019 conduct conveyed an implied threat of force designed to compel a reasonable person in the teller\u2019s position to give McFarland money. Therefore, we find that there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate a threat of force.\n\u00b627 Farnsworth contends that adopting this standard would create a strict liability crime and result in any demand for money inside a bank being automatically interpreted as a threat. This, he argues, would mean that any unlawful demand for money at a bank would constitute robbery. This concern is understandable but ultimately unfounded. In every such case, the circumstances will be unique and context-dependent, causing courts to determine whether the evidence supports an objective finding of a threat under our Witherspoon standard. For instance, a demand that arises out of confusion or mistake might not constitute a threat. Context matters.\n\u00b628 In contrast, a theft does not rise to the level of a robbery because it involves no use or threat of force to effectuate the same outcome: taking another person\u2019s property. For example, a theft would occur where an individual induced the bank teller to place money on the counter and then took it without having any entitlement to it. It would be a theft, not a robbery, because the hypothetical lacks even an implied threat of force. See, e.g., United States v. Wagstaff, 865 F.2d 626, 627, 629 (4th Cir. 1989) (finding insufficient evidence of robbery because the defendant did not take money \u201c \u2018by intimidation\u2019 \u201d where he removed money from a cash drawer without communicating with bank personnel). However, as the Collinsworth court observed, where a person demands the bank\u2019s money, \u201cunsupported by even the pretext of any lawful entitlement to the funds,\u201d the demand can contain an implicit threat of force. Collinsworth, 90 Wn. App. at 553; see also United States v. Hopkins, 703 F.2d 1102, 1103 (9th Cir. 1983) (finding sufficient evidence of \u201cintimidation\u201d for robbery when a man presented the teller a note stating it was a robbery and demanding money).\n\u00b629 In summary, a threat need not be direct or explicit to support a robbery conviction. A demand note for money at a bank can carry with it an implied threat of harm if the teller does not comply. Here, because Farnsworth\u2019s and McFarland\u2019s conduct could cause an ordinary person in the teller\u2019s position to reasonably infer a threat of force from their demand note, we find sufficient evidence of a threat of force.\n2. Sufficient Evidence Supports Farnsworth\u2019s Liability as an Accomplice to First Degree Robbery\n\u00b630 Farnsworth asks us to find that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction based on accomplice liability. However, we disagree because, as we concluded above, the crime committed was a robbery and Farnsworth planned the crime exactly as it occurred.\n\u00b631 A person may be liable for the acts of another if he or she is an accomplice to the act. RCW 9A.08.020(1), (2)(c). One is an \u201caccomplice\u201d of another if the person aids or agrees to aid the other in planning or committing the crime, with the knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the commission of such crime. RCW 9A.08.020(3)(a)(ii). The Court of Appeals found insufficient evidence that Farns-worth knowingly aided a robbery, and instead held that he agreed to aid only a theft. Farnsworth, 184 Wn. App. at 313-14. A person is construed to have adequate knowledge when he or she acts with knowledge that his or her conduct will promote the specific crime charged. State v. Cronin, 142 Wn.2d 568, 579, 14 P.3d 752 (2000). Thus, the question is whether Farnsworth agreed to aid in the commission of a robbery, including the use or threatened use of force or violence.\n\u00b632 Since we find that the crime committed contained an implied threat, we also find that Farnsworth had the requisite knowledge because he helped plan the crime exactly as it was committed. There was no deviation from their plan other than which member of the pair would enter the bank and who would wait in the car to drive them away after (and, of course, the evidence supporting the threat of force was not contingent on which of the two of them actually entered the bank). Most importantly, Farnsworth wrote the note that McFarland used. In fact, McFarland did not even read the note until later; he simply trusted Farns-worth\u2019s \u201cexperience\u201d to write a note that would compel the teller to hand over the money. 14 RP at 1253. Given our finding that under the circumstances, the note written by Farnsworth contained an implied threat, we find sufficient evidence that Farnsworth was an accomplice to the crime of robbery.\n3. Farnsworth Was Not Deprived of a Fair Trial Due to Cumulative Error\n\u00b633 Farnsworth argued on appeal that the cumulative effect of six errors deprived him of a fair trial. In the unpublished portion of its opinion, the Court of Appeals found only one suspect error, which it deemed harmless, and thus found that Farnsworth was not deprived of a fair trial under the cumulative error doctrine. Farnsworth now raises five claims of error to this court. We find that the trial court did not err, and even if it had, any such errors were harmless. Thus, he was not deprived of a fair trial.\n\u00b634 We review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion by the trial court. State v. Darden, 145 Wn.2d 612, 619, 41 P.3d 1189 (2002). An abuse of discretion occurs where a trial court\u2019s decision is manifestly unreasonable or made for untenable reasons. Id.\nA. Excluding McFarland\u2019s Plea Agreement Was Not Error\n\u00b635 Farnsworth claims that the trial court erred when it excluded McFarland\u2019s plea agreement, preventing Farns-worth from the opportunity to meaningfully cross-examine and impeach McFarland. Generally, evidence of a plea agreement under these circumstances would be properly admitted to allow the jury to be privy to any possible bias McFarland had in testifying against Farnsworth. See Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974) (defendants are entitled to expose the jury to facts from which they can weigh the witness\u2019 reliability). We find that because the jury was informed of the contents of the plea agreement, it learned of McFarland\u2019s possible bias and motive in testifying against him. Consequently, we find the trial court made a reasonable decision in excluding the actual plea agreement, which had the potential to confuse the jury without adding any relevant information.\n\u00b636 At trial, McFarland testified that he pleaded guilty to first degree theft. Farnsworth sought to admit McFarland\u2019s guilty plea agreement, which would show that he pleaded guilty to both first degree theft and first degree robbery; the latter charge would be removed if he testified. McFarland testified as to his plea agreement with the State on both direct examination and cross-examination. He told the jury he was facing \u201cthis bank robbery, and the third strike I would have had to fought [sic].... You get a third strike, it\u2019s life [in prison] without [parole].\u201d 14 RP at 1259. He told the jury that in exchange for complying with the State by testifying against Farnsworth, he would receive a shorter sentence. McFarland testified, \u201c[T]hey usually drop your charges down to a lower crime and you get a little lesser sentence . . . .\u201d Id. at 1348. On cross-examination, Farnsworth\u2019s counsel inquired into the plea agreement and the benefit McFarland would receive for testifying: a possible eight-year sentence instead of life imprisonment. Thus, the jury was well informed of its contents through McFarland\u2019s own testimony.\n\u00b637 The trial court heard argument from the parties about admitting the plea agreement, and ultimately excluded the plea agreement as being confusing, misleading, and irrelevant under ER 401 and 403. 15 RP 1395-1400. In general, only relevant evidence is admissible. ER 402. Evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any consequential fact more probable or less probable. ER 401. However, relevant evidence is inadmissible if the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury substantially outweighs its probative value. ER 403.\n\u00b638 The colloquy between the trial court, prosecutor, and Farnsworth\u2019s counsel shows that the document contained some extrinsic information that might have been misleading, confusing, or irrelevant. See 15 RP 1395-1400. As discussed, the jury heard McFarland testify about the contents of the plea agreement, thus learning about the potential motive McFarland had to testify against Farns-worth. The plea agreement would have added no new information that the jury did not already know from McFarland\u2019s own testimony, and thus admitting it had the potential to confuse the jury. Consequently, we believe that the trial court properly excluded it and do not find it was error to do so.\n\u00b639 Moreover, we do not have a copy of the plea agreement to review on this appeal. Generally, we cannot speculate on facts that are not part of the record. State v. Blight, 89 Wn.2d 38, 46, 569 P.2d 1129 (1977). Thus, our review consists of only the trial court\u2019s ruling and Farnsworth\u2019s briefing about the contents of the document. Farnsworth\u2019s description of the discrepancy between the plea agreement and McFarland\u2019s testimony does not warrant finding an error. The jury was well informed of the deal McFarland was receiving, and the jury could infer his motive to testify. Even if Farnsworth had presented the plea agreement to us and could show the trial court erred by excluding it, the error would have been harmless, as discussed in the next section.\nEven If Excluding McFarland\u2019s Plea Agreement Had Been Error, It Would Have Been Harmless Error\n\u00b640 Even if excluding the plea agreement had been error, it would not be a ground for reversing Farnsworth\u2019s conviction unless the error prejudiced the defendant. State v. Grenning, 169 Wn.2d 47, 57, 234 P.3d 169 (2010). Such an error is prejudicial where \u201c \u2018had the error not occurred, the outcome of the trial would have been materially affected.\u2019\u201d State v. Smith, 106 Wn.2d 772, 780, 725 P.2d 951 (1986) (quoting State v. Cunningham, 93 Wn.2d 823, 831, 613 P.2d 1139 (1980)). Applying that rule, we have often held that an erroneous admission or exclusion of evidence was harmless where the evidence merely provided additional evidence of something already shown by overwhelming untainted evidence (such additional evidence is often referred to as \u201c \u2018merely cumulative\u2019\u201d). State v. Gonzales Flores, 164 Wn.2d 1, 19, 186 P.3d 1038 (2008) (quoting Dennis J. Sweeney, An Analysis of Harmless Error in Washington: A Principled Process, 31 Gonz. L. Rev. 277, 319 (1995)).\n\u00b641 Here, the exclusion of McFarland\u2019s plea agreement did not materially affect the outcome of the trial. As discussed above, the jury was well aware of the benefit McFarland received by testifying against Farnsworth. It would be different if the plea agreement was excluded and the jury did not otherwise learn of the plea deal. Under those circumstances, the jury would have not learned of McFarland\u2019s potential bias and would have been unable to judge the veracity of McFarland\u2019s testimony. However, that is simply not the case here. McFarland\u2019s statements fully informed the jury of the deal he was to receive in exchange for his testimony against Farnsworth, and the plea agreement was merely cumulative of other evidence presented. From that, the jury already had the relevant information to evaluate McFarland\u2019s motive to testify. Therefore, we find that even if it had been error to exclude the plea agreement, the error would have been harmless.\nB. The Trial Court Did Not Err by Admitting Evidence of Farnsworth\u2019s Prior Acts\n\u00b642 Farnsworth argues that the trial court erred by allowing the jury to hear information about his prior acts in two instances: (1) the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, which discussed Farnsworth\u2019s two 2004 convictions for robbery while wearing a wig without eliciting evidence thereof during trial, and (2) testimony regarding Farns-worth\u2019s rude conduct toward McFarland at Western State Hospital. As discussed below, we find that neither ruling was in error.\na. State\u2019s Opening Statement\n\u00b643 Before trial, the parties argued to the trial court about the admissibility of Farnsworth\u2019s prior robbery convictions. The trial court decided to allow the evidence because the prior robberies went to prove Farnsworth\u2019s knowledge as to the planning of the present robbery, as he carried them out in a similar manner (by wearing a wig and sunglasses). 4 RP at 161. Accordingly, during her opening statement, the prosecutor commented on Farnsworth\u2019s prior robbery convictions committed while he was wearing a wig. However, she did not end up eliciting evidence thereof during trial. Farnsworth moved for a mistrial, which the trial court denied. 17 RP at 1675-77.\n\u00b644 A prosecutor\u2019s opening statement may outline the anticipated evidence that counsel has a good faith belief will be produced at trial. State v. Campbell, 103 Wn.2d 1, 15-16, 691 P.2d 929 (1984). The defendant bears the burden of showing the prosecutor acted without good faith. Id. at 16.\n\u00b645 Here, when the State mentioned the robberies in its opening statement, it intended to elicit evidence of the robberies, as evidenced by the arguments prior to trial about the admissibility thereof. Farnsworth does not claim the prosecutor acted in bad faith by noting his prior robbery convictions in its opening statement, nor does the record show bad faith. Instead, the record shows that the prosecution changed its strategy and opted to elicit such evidence in rebuttal. In response, the defense changed its strategy, and then the State decided not to elicit evidence regarding the prior robberies. Therefore, this claim of error fails because the State\u2019s opening merely outlined anticipated evidence that would be produced at trial, as allowed by our case law.\nb. Farnsworth\u2019s Rude Conduct at Western State Hospital\n\u00b646 At trial, the judge allowed McFarland to testify regarding Farnsworth\u2019s rude conduct toward him when they were at a hospital together after the crime. Farnsworth claims that decision violated ER 404(b) because the evidence had no probative value and prejudiced the jury against him. Farnsworth is correct that ER 404(b) precludes evidence of conduct intended to show that the defendant acted in conformity therewith in the charged incident. However, such evidence may \u201cbe admissible for another purpose, such as proof of motive, plan, or identity.\u201d State v. Foxhoven, 161 Wn.2d 168, 175, 163 P.3d 786 (2007).\n\u00b647 In this case, the State elicited testimony not to show that Farnsworth was dangerous or acting in conformity with his conduct, but rather to offer evidence of McFarland\u2019s motive to testify against him. On the stand, McFarland explained that he considered \u201ctaking the beef for [Farnsworth],\u201d but after Farnsworth acted rudely toward him while they were at a hospital together, McFarland decided to testify against him. 15 RP at 1431. Since the purpose of eliciting the testimony was to show McFarland\u2019s motive to testify against Farnsworth, it was not error to allow it under ER 404(b).\nC. Allowing Detective\u2019s Testimony regarding Statements Made by Farnsworth Was Not Error\n\u00b648 Prior to trial, Farnsworth was ordered to provide a sample of his handwriting. He refused. At trial, the detective who attempted to obtain the handwriting sample relayed statements Farnsworth made to him when refusing to provide the handwriting sample. Specifically, the detective testified about Farnsworth\u2019s anger and his reasons for not complying with the court order. Farnsworth did not object to this testimony at the time, but he now claims that this testimony violated his constitutional right to remain silent.\n\u00b649 Normally, we do not review such errors raised for the first time on appeal, although RAP 2.5(a) allows an appellate court to review an error not raised at trial if it was a manifest error affecting a constitutional right. To show that an error was manifest, one must demonstrate that the claimed error had identifiable consequences to the outcome of the trial whereby the court must put itself in the trial court\u2019s shoes to determine if the trial court could have corrected the error, given what the trial court knew at that time. State v. Kalebaugh, 183 Wn.2d 578, 584, 355 P.3d 253 (2015).\n\u00b650 Here, Farnsworth claims the error affected his constitutional right to remain silent. Accepting that, we must look to see if the error was \u201cmanifest.\u201d We conclude that admitting the detective\u2019s testimony was not manifest error. McFarland\u2019s detailed testimony implicating Farnsworth had a much greater impact than the detective\u2019s testimony that Farnsworth was angry about providing a handwriting sample. Therefore, given what the trial court knew at the time, it would not reasonably conclude that admitting the detective\u2019s testimony would have identifiable consequences as to the outcome of Farnsworth\u2019s trial. Therefore, this is not a manifest error that would warrant our review despite Farnsworth\u2019s failure to raise this issue at trial.\nI). Farnsworth\u2019s Presumption of Innocence Was Not Violated\n\u00b651 Farnsworth claims that his presumption of innocence was violated because he was marked with in-custody status as he sat in a \u201chard wooden chair,\u201d instead of the \u201csoft, padded, leather chairs\u201d counsel sat in. Answer to Pet. for Review & Cross Pet. at 18. A criminal defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence is violated where the defendant lacks the appearance of \u201ca free and innocent man.\" State v. Finch, 137 Wn.2d 792, 844, 975 P.2d 967 (1999) (plurality opinion) (the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was violated when he appeared before the jury in physical restraints). Finch pointed to prison garb and shackles or handcuffs as examples of physical markings of in-custody status. Id.\n\u00b652 We find that the trial court did not err by allowing Farnsworth to sit in the wooden chair because a wooden chair does not carry the same association as do the physical restraints that this court is typically concerned with. See, e.g., State v. Clark, 143 Wn.2d 731, 774, 24 P.3d 1006 (2001) (considering whether defendant\u2019s shackling upon entering the jury auditorium was unconstitutional); State v. Jennings, 111 Wn. App. 54, 61, 44 P.3d 1 (2002) (considering whether a stun belt restraining defendant was unconstitutional shackling). Thus, we find that Farnsworth\u2019s presumption of innocence was not violated and the trial court was not in error.\nE. The Cumulative Error Doctrine Does Not Warrant Reversal\n\u00b653 The trial judge did not err by excluding McFarland\u2019s plea agreement, but even if it had been error, it was harmless because all of the relevant information from the plea agreement was already in front of the jury. As discussed above, Farnsworth\u2019s other claims were also not error. Therefore, there can be no accumulation of error that would warrant reversal under the cumulative error doctrine. See State v. Weber, 159 Wn.2d 252, 279, 149 P.3d 646 (2006) (holding that the doctrine is inapplicable when \u201cthe errors are few and have little or no effect on the outcome of the trial\u201d).\n4. The Issue of Comparability Is Remanded to the Court of Appeals\n\u00b654 Finally, Farnsworth asks us to find that his prior out-of-state conviction is not legally comparable to a strike in Washington for purposes of sentencing under the POAA. The Court of Appeals did not reach this issue because it reversed his robbery conviction on other grounds. Having affirmed his conviction, we now remand this comparability issue to the Court of Appeals to consider on its merits.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b655 We hold that the evidence in this case was sufficient to establish an implied threat of force. In the banking context, a demand note for money under these circumstances objectively conveys an implied threat of force or violence, even though no explicit threat was made. None of Farnsworth\u2019s other claims are meritorious, and thus we affirm his conviction. We remand the issue of the comparability of Farnsworth\u2019s earlier out-of-state conviction to the Court of Appeals to decide on its merits.\nJohnson, Wiggins, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nFurthermore, it is questionable whether counsel did enough to preserve this issue for appellate review. See RAP 2.5(a). Counsel would have been well advised to make a clearer objection on the record.\nThe dissent contends that Farnsworth raised a constitutional error rather than an evidentiary error, and that thus the proper standard is whether the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Farnsworth\u2019s briefs are not clear on this issue, as they do not discuss either standard, but we need not decide this issue because this error was harmless under either standard. The plea agreement was probative of one thing: McFarland\u2019s potential motive in testifying against Farnsworth. As we have explained, the jury was made aware by McFarland that he would receive a lower sentence in exchange for testifying. Since they received the relevant information necessary to evaluate McFarland\u2019s credibility, the exclusion of the plea agreement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nWhile at a hospital together after their arrest, McFarland testified that Farnsworth called him a \u201c \u2018fucking stool pigeon\u2019 \u201d and also \u201cflipped [McFarland] the bird,\u2019\u2019 pulled his pants down and \u201cgrabbed his private parts and says, \u2018Suck on these you son of a bitch.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 15 RP at 1430.",

But I disagree with its conclusion that the trial court properly excluded key state witness James McFarland\u2019s written plea agreement, leaving the jury with McFarland\u2019s slanted characterization of its details instead. With a cooperating code-fendant witness\u2019s plea agreement, the devil is in the details: they establish the extent of the benefit that the witness stands to gain, what will trigger the benefit, and why the witness might testify falsely to gain that benefit. Excluding the plea agreement with all its details therefore violated Farnsworth\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Wash. Const. art. I, \u00a7 22. For that reason, I respectfully dissent from the portion of the lead opinion rejecting that claim.\nANALYSIS\nI. THE TRIAL COURT COMPLETELY EXCLUDED MCFARLAND\u2019S ACTUAL PLEA AGREEMENT BUT ADMITTED HIS SLANTED CHARACTERIZATION OF IT INSTEAD\n\u00b658 McFarland was a key witness for the State. He testified for three days; no other witness testified for anywhere near that amount of time. He was the one who entered the bank to rob it; Farnsworth did not. He was the one who was caught on camera; Farnsworth was not. He was the one who requested the money from the teller; Farnsworth did not. 13 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (RP) at 1233, 1256-58. And, critically, he was the one who testified that Farnsworth had plotted with him to rob that bank; Farnsworth did not. E.g., 14 RP at 1259.\n\u00b659 While there was independent evidence corroborating the fact that McFarland entered the bank, wore a disguise, handed the demand note to the teller, got $333, and then left, there was no evidence corroborating McFarland\u2019s claims about what he and Farnsworth agreed about or disagreed about in the truck right before McFarland entered the bank. Specifically, there was no evidence to corroborate McFarland\u2019s trial claim that Farns-worth manipulated McFarland into entering the bank\u2014as opposed to McFarland\u2019s earlier statements that Farnsworth instead completely \u201cbacked out\u201d of the robbery before it ever happened.\n\u00b660 That made McFarland\u2019s credibility critical for the State and attacking McFarland\u2019s credibility critical for the defense.\n\u00b661 The State realized this; it preemptively moved to exclude McFarland\u2019s plea agreement so that the defense could not cross-examine McFarland about its details. The deputy prosecutor argued that the written plea agreement was entirely inadmissible despite its impeachment value: \u201cI do not know the basis [ ] or how he would be able to give an entire plea form to the jury.\u201d 15 RP at 1395.\n\u00b662 Defense counsel also realized this, so he opposed the State\u2019s motion to exclude McFarland\u2019s guilty plea. He argued that the guilty plea exposed inaccuracies in McFarland\u2019s testimony and thus allowed Farnsworth to challenge McFarland\u2019s credibility. Specifically, he explained that when McFarland testified in the State\u2019s case in chief, he left the impression that he had already gained the main benefit of his plea bargain even before he testified at trial by claiming that under the plea agreement, he had pleaded guilty to only theft, not first degree robbery; he testified, \u201cI didn\u2019t enter no guilty plea to first degree robbery and first degree theft, I don\u2019t think. It was just supposed to be first degree theft, from what I understand.\u201d 14 RP at 1347. Defense counsel explained that the real plea agreement could expose that misstatement: \u201cThis document [the plea agreement] does not say that he\u2019s looking at 8 to 10 years,\u201d as McFarland claimed; instead, it indicates he is facing life without parole because it shows a plea to first degree robbery. 15 RP at 1399. Defense counsel also explained that McFarland \u201cdid not articulate, at least not such that I understood, that he understood that the count was going to be vacated. I believe he thought that it... already perhaps had been.\u201d Id. at 1400.\n\u00b663 Defense counsel was correct about these factual inaccuracies in McFarland\u2019s testimony. Indeed, the lead opinion acknowledges that McFarland\u2019s testimony created the misimpression that he had already gained the benefit of his plea bargain. Lead opinion at 781. It was a misim-pression because in reality, McFarland had actually pleaded guilty to both first degree theft and first degree robbery before he testified. His only hope of escaping the life-without-parole consequence of that first degree robbery, third-strike plea was for the State to move to dismiss the robbery after it heard McFarland\u2019s testimony against Farns-worth. The State agreed that that was the true meaning of the plea agreement and that McFarland\u2019s testimony to the contrary was incorrect; the prosecutor told the trial court, \u201cWell, here is where the confusion is going to come in. Because he is a three-striker, I can\u2019t amend the document. I can\u2019t amend his charges up front because then, obviously, the benefit of the bargain has been given before any perfor-manee.\u201d 15 RP at 1396. The prosecutor even read the language of that specific portion of the plea agreement out loud for the judge to hear. Id. at 1397.\n\u00b664 So the prosecutor knew that in reality, McFarland had already pleaded guilty to both theft and first degree robbery and that he had no hope of avoiding its third strike, life-without-parole consequence unless the State moved to dismiss after McFarland testified. The defense also knew that. So did the judge. But the trial court ruled that the jury couldn\u2019t hear that.\n\u00b665 Instead, the jury heard only McFarland\u2019s characterization of the benefit he expected to receive from testifying, and that it was not that much. According to McFarland, he did not plead guilty to the most serious charge and he had already received the benefit of his bargain.\nII. EXCLUDING THE ACTUAL PLEA AGREEMENT AND LEAVING THE JURY WITH ONLY MCFARLAND\u2019S MISLEADING CHARACTERIZATION OF IT VIOLATED THE RIGHT TO CONFRONT AND CROSS-EXAMINE WITNESSES\n\u00b666 The trial court excluded the actual plea agreement as irrelevant because McFarland had already admitted to some but not all of the agreement\u2019s terms. Id. at 1399 (\u201cHis motivation is 8 to 10 years versus life in prison; that\u2019s what he\u2019s already testified to.\u201d). It also excluded the plea agreement as too confusing, because McFarland\u2019s testimony about its terms differed from its actual terms. Id. at 1399-1400 (sustaining prosecutor\u2019s objection based on \u201c[ER] 403; confusing, misleading. [ER] 401; irrelevant\u201d). The lead opinion upholds both decisions. Lead opinion at 781.\n\u00b667 But the fact that the State\u2019s key witness claimed confusion (rather than deceit) about the plea agreement\u2019s details is not a reason to exclude the real plea agreement as too \u201cconfusing\u201d for the jury under Rules of Evidence (ER) 403. And the fact that the State\u2019s key witness admitted to some but not all of the incentives the plea agreement provided does not make the details of the omitted incentives \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the jury\u2019s assessment of witness credibility under ER 401.\n\u00b668 Instead, those factors make details about the plea agreement\u2019s actual terms more relevant and admissible\u2014 because the contradiction between the real plea bargain terms and McFarland\u2019s slanted characterization of them could show that the witness still had a motive to curry favor with the State, and that he was trying to hide that. The United States Supreme Court has clearly held that evidence of a plea bargain between the State and a testifying witness is admissible on cross-examination for just this reason. In Delaware v. Van Arsdall, for example, the Supreme Court reviewed a trial court\u2019s decision to deny cross-examination regarding the prosecutor\u2019s agreement to dismiss the witness\u2019s criminal charges. 475 U.S. 673, 676, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986). The Court ruled that barring all such inquiry violated Van Arsdall\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause and that \u201ca criminal defendant states a violation of the Confrontation Clause by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby \u2018to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 680 (alteration in original) (quoting Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974) and citing U.S. Const. amend. VI).\n\u00b669 Washington courts, of course, follow this authority. They also hold that the right to confront and cross-examine includes the right to expose a cooperating witness\u2019s plea agreement\u2019s details\u2014its \u201cspecific reasons\u201d\u2014suggesting bias: \u201c \u2018The right of cross-examination allows more than the asking of general questions concerning bias; it guarantees an opportunity to show specific reasons why a [codefendant] witness [testifying pursuant to a plea bargain] might be biased in a particular case.\u2019\u201d State v. Portnoy, 43 Wn. App. 455, 461, 718 P.2d 805 (1986) (some emphasis added) (first alteration in original) (quoting State v. Brooks, 25 Wn. App. 550, 551-52, 611 P.2d 1274 (1980)). \u201cSuch cross examination is the price the State must pay for admission of a codefen-dant\u2019s testimony to that plea. The jury needs to have full information about the witness\u2019s guilty plea in order to intelligently evaluate his testimony about the crimes allegedly committed with the defendant.\u201d Id.; see Brooks, 25 Wn. App. at 551-52 (\u201cGreat latitude must be allowed in cross-examining a key prosecution witness, particularly an accomplice who has turned State\u2019s witness, to show motive for his testimony. The right of cross-examination allows more than the asking of general questions concerning bias; it guarantees an opportunity to show specific reasons why a witness might be biased in a particular case. Here, the dropping of the deadly weapon allegation pursuant to the plea bargain agreement obviated a mandatory 5-year minimum term for Macklin if he were sentenced to prison. The jury was entitled to consider that evidence in weighing Macklin\u2019s credibility.\u201d (emphasis added) (citations omitted)); State v. Ahlfinger, 50 Wn. App. 466, 475 n.4, 749 P.2d 190 (1988).\n\u00b670 The lead opinion certainly recognizes that the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses is a right of constitutional magnitude. Lead opinion at 781-82. The lead opinion rejects the confrontation clause claim, though, because it concludes\u2014as did the State and the trial court\u2014 that McFarland\u2019s testimony was close enough to the truth that the real truth did not matter. 15 RP at 1399 (prosecutor argues, \u201cMr. McFarland\u2019s understanding is correct. He doesn\u2019t have the mechanics exactly correct. And ... as he sits here today he still is charged as a three-striker. But his consideration in exchange for his cooperation is that I vacate it afterwards; so the substance is accurate\u201d; court agrees); lead opinion at 783 (\u201cThe jury was well informed of the deal McFarland was receiving . . . .\u201d).\n\u00b671 But it really was not that close. The jury did not get to hear that McFarland had already pleaded guilty to the three-strikes charge and that he therefore had a greater incentive to testify favorably for the State than he admitted. The jury did not get to hear that he was unable to describe things in the plea agreement accurately, despite having read and initialed those specific provisions. The jury heard defense counsel\u2019s questions on these points, but McFarland never admitted the truth and the court prevented defense counsel from proving it up.\nIII. THE STATE HAS NOT PROVED THAT THE ERROR WAS HARMLESS BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT\n\u00b672 The State made no argument that the confrontation clause error was harmless. The lead opinion addresses this issue anyway.\nA. The Constitutional Harmless Error Standard\n\u00b673 To address the issue properly, we must acknowledge that violating the confrontation clause is an error of constitutional magnitude because it infringes on the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment and article I, section 22 rights to confront witnesses against him. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 673; Davis, 415 U.S. at 318. It therefore requires reversal unless the State shows that it is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 680; Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967). \u201cThe correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized,\u201d we can nevertheless say that the error was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 684. I therefore address the importance of McFarland\u2019s testimony in context and then the importance of the excluded evidence.\nB. McFarland Alone Provided the Critical Testimony That Farnsworth Planned and Executed the Robbery with Him\n\u00b674 McFarland\u2019s testimony was important. It covered three days and spans three volumes of transcript. See 13-15 RP (Oct. 20, 24 and 25, 2011). He entered the bank\u2014 Farnsworth did not; he was caught on camera inside the bank\u2014Farnsworth was not; he gave the note to the teller\u2014 Farnsworth did not; and he took the money and left the bank\u2014Farnsworth did not.\n\u00b675 To be sure, all of McFarland\u2019s testimony about his entering the bank, robbing the teller, and leaving with the money was corroborated by statements from other neutral witnesses and cameras. But there was a critical piece of evidence that McFarland alone provided: his testimony that Farnsworth helped plan, and then followed through by helping to execute, this specific heist. The State knew that that testimony from McFarland on this point was critical; its closing argument acknowledged that the jury could not convict Farnsworth unless they found he actively helped with this particular robbery. The State therefore understood that testimony from McFarland on this point had to be believable. E.g., 14 RP at 1314 (McFarland vehemently defends his truthfulness at trial). In short, McFarland\u2019s credibility was critical to the State because it formed the basis for its argument that Farnsworth was the brains of the operation.\n\u00b676 It necessarily follows that attacking McFarland\u2019s credibility was critical for the defense because it formed the basis for their theory that at the last minute, McFarland went off on his own after Farnsworth backed out. E.g., 17 RP at 1639 (defense counsel\u2019s closing argument that \u201c[McFarland] needs to give the State what they want in his testimony\u201d), 1640-50, 1653 (Defense\u2019s closing: \u201c[T]here\u2019s only two significant issues in the case: Can you believe Mr. McFarland, and was [the bank teller] scared . . . .\u201d).\n\u00b677 It is, of course, true that there was sufficient other evidence to connect Farnsworth with McFarland\u2019s robbery. That other evidence included Farnsworth\u2019s statement that McFarland was wearing the wig and sunglass disguise when he left the truck and headed for the bank. Clerk\u2019s Papers at 2-3; 12 RP at 1051. It included testimony from other witnesses that Farnsworth drove the truck that brought McFarland to the bank. 11 RP at 766-67, 810-11. It also included testimony that McFarland met that truck shortly after he left the bank and found Farnsworth still driving, and that officers then stopped the truck and found the wig, sunglasses, and cash from the bank inside. 10 RP at 616; 11 RP at 752; 13 RP at 1061. It further included testimony that Farnsworth denied knowing that McFarland was heading inside to rob the bank, but when arrested afterward and told by the detectives that they were facing first degree robbery charges, he responded, \u201c \u2018We didn\u2019t have a gun.\u2019 \u201d 15 RP at 1484. And, finally, it included expert testimony that \u201cCharles Farnsworth wrote the questioned [demand] note and that James McFarland did not.\u201d 12 RP at 1028.\n\u00b678 But the evidence that Farnsworth was the \u201cbrains\u201d of the operation and that he followed through on any prior statements about wanting to rob this bank was thin and contradictory. Critically, there was McFarland\u2019s testimony that Farnsworth had actually \u201cbacked out\u201d of any prior agreement to rob a bank and that McFarland at the last minute dashed off on his own without Farnsworth\u2019s help, assistance, or approval. E.g., 13 RP at 1208 (McFarland testifies Farnsworth \u201cbacked out two or three times -- three times as a matter of fact.\u201d), 1219 (McFarland treats backing out as a sign of weakness, testifying that his \u201cdope lady\u201d accused him of backing out, and McFarland defends his honor by explaining, \u201c[Farnsworth\u2019s] the one that backed out, not me.\u201d), 1231 (right before this robbery, \u201c[Farnsworth] would just make up excuses for not going ahead and going through with this\u201d), 1232 (same), 1233 (\u201c[Farnsworth] was just\u2014you know, I wasn\u2019t really\u2014I just seen that he wasn\u2019t going to do it and I got mad. I got mad. I reached over and snatched the wig out of his hand and said, \u2018Give me that son of a bitch.\u2019 I said, \u201cYon ain\u2019t going to do nothing.\u2019 I snatched the wig, put it on. I says, \u2018Wait right here. I\u2019ll be back in two minutes.\u2019 \u201d), 1238 (same), 1239 (\u201cIt\u2019s been five to six hours and this kind of thing. [Farnsworth h]as been backing out and backing out and backing out. So I grabbed the wig out of his hand. I said, \u2018Give me that son of a bitch. I\u2019m going up there.\u2019 \u201d); 14 RP at 1306 (same); 15 RP at 1380 (same).\n\u00b679 As the State itself summarized, \u201cAt trial, McFarland explained how the defendant obtained the wig that he wore into the bank and that it was the defendant who was actually supposed to do the robbery. The defendant continually backed out, and McFarland was quite drunk from trying to drown the effects of going without heroin, that he really couldn\u2019t drive. [15 RP at] 1380; [14 RP at] 1301. Ultimately, in a moment of frustration, McFarland grabbed the wig and glasses and went into the Credit Union. [14 RP at] 1306.\u201d Br. of Resp\u2019t at 7 (emphasis added); RP (Trial, Opening Statements) (Oct. 13, 2011) at 5-6 (State\u2019s opening statement: \u201cIt was Mr. Farnsworth that was supposed to do the robbery but he kept backing out.\u201d).\n\u00b680 The State had to deal with that wrinkle in its case in closing, and it did so by arguing that Farnsworth was faking backing out and really using \u201cmanipulative behavior ... for the purpose that Mr. McFarland suggested, which is that he just wanted to wear McFarland down to get him to take the bigger risk.\u201d 17 RP at 1622 (emphasis added). Thus, the critical issue for the jury was whether or not to believe McFarland\u2019s \u201csuggestion\u201d about Farnsworth\u2019s major role in planning and then manipulating McFarland into doing the robbery himself. If McFarland\u2019s testimony on these points were not believable, then probably all the State could have proved was rendering criminal assistance afterward. RCW 9A.76.050(3). That is not a third strike.\n\u00b681 In context, McFarland\u2019s testimony and credibility were critical to Farnsworth\u2019s conviction of first degree robbery, which is a third-strike offense.\nC. McFarland\u2019s Plea Agreement Would Have Enabled the Defense To Cast Doubt on McFarland\u2019s Claims of Honesty, Impartiality, and Lack of Bias\n\u00b682 Given this context, the excluded evidence was very important. Exclusion allowed McFarland to avoid tough questions about whether he misperceived the plea agreement (which could have bolstered an argument that he also misperceived Farnsworth\u2019s supposed acquiescence in the robbery), misremembered the plea agreement (which could have bolstered an argument that he also misremembered Farnsworth\u2019s supposed role in the robbery), or lied about the agreement (which could have bolstered an argument that he lied about Farnsworth\u2019s role in the robbery). McFarland\u2019s hope for a future benefit based on his performance at Farnsworth\u2019s trial certainly provided him with more incentive to curry favor with the State than a \u201cdone deal\u201d would have.\n\u00b683 To be sure, as the State argued, Farnsworth was able to show that McFarland \u201cwas a long-time heroin addict, an alcoholic, had failed rehabilitation, had made a routine of stealing to support himself, was homeless with no means of support, had contemplated stealing a car on the day of the robbery, and in fact stole some merchandise that day. He further demonstrated that the witness was very familiar with the Department of Corrections, had a high offender score, and spent a large portion of his adult life incarcerated. It\u2019s difficult to imagine being able to paint a more dreary or unfavorable image of witness than was allowed.\u201d Br. of Resp\u2019t at 12; see also 13 RP at 1200 (McFarland testifies he was so sick from withdrawal the day of the robbery, he was hallucinating). But evidence that McFarland was \u201cdreary or unfavorable\u201d is not the same as evidence that he had a strong incentive to slant his testimony to curry favor with the State.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b684 I agree with the lead opinion that the evidence of Farnsworth\u2019s involvement with McFarland in a prior plan to rob something was sufficient. But the evidence of Farns-worth\u2019s assistance with this particular robbery was not strong. Some testimony even made this particular robbery sound like it was McFarland\u2019s own personal, individual moment of drunken frustration after Farnsworth had \u201cbacked out.\u201d McFarland\u2019s credibility about Farnsworth\u2019s planning and execution of this particular robbery was therefore critical.\n\u00b685 Given that context, I cannot say that the constitutional error of excluding the plea agreement that could have impeached McFarland is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The reason is that cross-examination about that plea agreement\u2019s details could have revealed the extent of the benefit that the witness expected from testifying favorably for the State and what would trigger that benefit, and hence why the witness might testify falsely to gain that benefit. I therefore respectfully dissent in part.\nFairhurst, Stephens, and Gonz\u00e1lez, JJ., concur with Gordon McCloud, J.\nReconsideration denied August 9, 2016.\nMcFarland claimed that he had already avoided the robbery with its third-strike consequence: \u201cI was facing \u2014 I was facing this bank robbery, and the third strike I would have had to fought [sic].\u201d 14 RP at 1259.\nAccording to the prosecutor, \u201cOn Page 4 of 6 under \u2018Prosecutor\u2019s obligations\u2019 it indicates that \u2018If Mr. McFarland completely fulfills all his obligations as listed above, the state will move the court to vacate his conviction to Count I, Robbery in the First Degree; Count II, Theft in the First Degree shall remain and the defendant will be sentenced as to that count.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 15 RP at 1397.\nMcFarland\u2019s testimony also left the impression that he accurately understood and related what his plea agreement contained. But he did not. As Farnsworth\u2019s counsel explained, \u201cAnd he\u2019s indicated that he doesn\u2019t know what the standard range sentence for Theft I is, and it\u2019s contained in this [plea agreement]. And he\u2019s initialed various parts of this [plea agreement]. He signed at the very end of it.\u2019\u2019 Id. at 1398.\nAccord Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 231, 109 S. Ct. 480, 102 L.

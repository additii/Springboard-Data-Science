The use of the writs there specified is an affirmative grant of constitutional jurisdiction, with which the legislature cannot interfere, as has been fully considered and decided by this court, during the present term, in the case of Philip L. Anthony, Ex parte. It is, however, competent for the legislature to provide other means than the use of those writs, for the purpose of revising the proceedings of inferior courts; and in such cases the remedy, so provided, depends entirely upon the legislature for its existence, who may modify or abolish it at pleasure. This doctrine was fully established in the case of The State vs. Graham, 1 Ark. Rep. 428. This case comes within those principles; and inasmuch as the legislature have not, by any law, conferred the right of appeal from judgments of the county court, the supreme court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the cause upon the appeal.\nThe case must therefore be dismissed.",

The motion was over-,\u2018uled, and Hays appealed to this court. Linton & Batson, for \"lays, filed an assignment of errors: but Watkins, \u00bfWy Gen\u2019l, filed * motion to dismiss the case, on the ground that no appeal lies to ihis court from the final judgment of a county court."

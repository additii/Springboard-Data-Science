        "text": "[As amended by order of the Supreme Court August 15, 2016.]\nWiggins, J.\n\u00b61 \u2014 Kut Suen Lui and May Far Lui (the Luis) owned a building that sustained water damage after a pipe burst while the building was vacant. The Luis\u2019 insurance policy for the building limited coverage for water damage in two ways based on vacancy: coverage was suspended if the building remained vacant for 60 consecutive days and, effective at the beginning of any vacancy, there was no coverage for certain specified losses, including water damage. The Luis argue that the policy is ambiguous and should be interpreted in the Luis\u2019 favor to mean that the exclusion of coverage for water damage would commence only after a 60-day vacancy. We reject the Luis\u2019 arguments and find that the policy unambiguously excluded coverage for water damage immediately upon vacancy. We reverse the trial court\u2019s contrary holding and affirm the Court of Appeals.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\u00b62 The Luis owned a building containing tenant space. The building\u2019s last tenant, the Agape Foundation Inc., left the building in the first week of December 2010 after being evicted by the Luis for failure to pay rent. At the time of the incidents giving rise to this claim, the Luis were not renting the building to a tenant.\n\u00b63 On or about January 1, 2011, less than 60 days after the Agape Foundation Inc. moved out of the building, a frozen sprinkler pipe broke in the building and caused substantial water damage to the building. Upon discovering the water damage, the Luis notified their insurance provider, Essex Insurance Company, and filed a claim. Essex began investigating the Luis\u2019 claim and paid the Luis a total of $293,598.05 for property damage during the course of its investigation.\n\u00b64 After paying this sum, Essex discovered that the property was vacant at the time of the water damage. Essex then denied the Luis\u2019 claim and refused to pay any more money. In denying the Luis\u2019 claim, Essex sent their attorney a letter explaining that the endorsement in the Luis\u2019 insurance policy excluded coverage for the water damage because it occurred while the building was vacant. The letter explained Essex\u2019s reasoning as follows:\nThis letter explains the reasons why Essex must deny your clients\u2019 claim based on the investigation to date.\nFirst, the policy contains a Change of Conditions Endorsement, which I copy here at Appendix A. This Endorsement was specifically endorsed to the policy over the past few years. As you will see, that Endorsement states:\nEffective at the inception of any vacancy or unoccupancy, the Causes of Loss provided by this policy are limited to Fire, Lightning, Explosion, Windstorm or Hail, Smoke, Aircraft or Vehicles, Riot or Civil Commotion, unless prior approval has been obtained from the Company.\nIn this situation, the subject building was vacant and unoccupied at the time of the loss. The insurance company was never notified of the vacancy until after the loss, and hence never approved coverage beyond the named perils listed in the Endorsement. The cause of the January 1, 2011 loss was not one of the perils named in the Change of Conditions Endorsement. Therefore, the insurance company cannot provide coverage for the claimed loss.\nIn addition, the letter stated that Essex would refrain from seeking reimbursement for the money that Essex had already paid to the Luis on condition that the Luis would not pursue their claim any further.\n\u00b65 The Luis sued Essex, claiming total damages in the amount of $758,863.31. Both the Luis and Essex filed cross motions for summary judgment. Essex argued that the unambiguous language of the \u201cChange in Condition Endorsement\u201d (the endorsement) in the Luis\u2019 insurance policy immediately suspends coverage at the inception of any vacancy for all but specifically named causes of loss. Because the property was vacant and water damage was not one of the named causes of loss, Essex argued that the court should rule that the Luis were not entitled to coverage as a matter of law. The Luis argued that coverage restrictions from their policy\u2019s \u201cVacancy Provisions\u201d become effective if the property is vacant for a period of 60 consecutive days. Further, the Luis sought summary judgment on the grounds that (1) Essex was estopped from denying coverage, (2) Essex waived its right to deny coverage, and (3) Essex denied the coverage in bad faith.\n\u00b66 The trial court denied Essex\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Luis solely on its conclusion that the endorsement was internally ambiguous and, therefore, had to be construed as providing coverage for the water damage. Specifically, the trial court stated, \u201cThe court finds there is a conflict in the two paragraphs of the change of conditions endorsement.\u201d The court resolved the conflict in favor of the Luis, holding that the word \u201cinception\u201d from the endorsement \u201cdoes not suspend coverage automatically.\u201d The court acknowledged that it was ruling only on the \u201cnarrow issue\u201d that there was \u201ca conflict in the language\u201d of the endorsement. Thus, the court declined to grant summary judgment on the Luis\u2019 waiver, estoppel, and bad faith claims, stating that there are questions of material fact that govern those issues.\n\u00b67 Essex moved for reconsideration and asked in the alternative that the court certify the ruling for appeal under RAP 2.3(b)(4). The court denied Essex\u2019s motion for reconsideration but did certify its ruling for review. In certifying its ruling for review, the court also ordered \u201cthat all further action in this Court involving the Luis\u2019 claims against Essex are severed and stayed pending resolution of Essex\u2019 appeal to the Court of Appeals.\u201d\n\u00b68 The Court of Appeals accepted review on the certified issue of whether the provisions within the endorsement were ambiguous. In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of the Luis. The Court of Appeals ruled that the plain language of the endorsement unambiguously limited coverage to only the enumerated causes of loss at the moment the building became vacant, not after 60 days as the Luis argued. The Luis then filed a petition for review with this court, which we granted.\nANALYSIS\nI. Standard of Review\n\u00b69 \u201cThis court reviews summary judgment determinations de novo, engaging in the same inquiry as the trial court.\u201d Durland v. San Juan County, 182 Wn.2d 55, 69, 340 P.3d 191 (2014). \u201cSummary judgment is proper where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Id. Courts interpret language in an insurance policy as a matter of law, and we review de novo. Expedia, Inc. v. Steadfast Ins. Co., 180 Wn.2d 793, 802, 329 P.3d 59 (2014).\nII. The Luis\u2019 Insurance Policy Did Not Cover the Water Damage\n\u00b610 We construe insurance policies as contracts. Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 142 Wn.2d 654, 665, 15 P.3d 115 (2000). When we interpret an insurance policy, we consider the insurance policy as a whole, giving the policy \u201c \u2018a fair, reasonable, and sensible construction as would be given to the contract by the average person purchasing insurance.\u2019\u201d Key Tronic Corp. v. Aetna (CIGNA) Fire Underwriters Ins. Co., 124 Wn.2d 618, 627, 881 P.2d 201 (1994) (quoting Queen City Farms, Inc. v. Cent. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. of Omaha, 126 Wn.2d 50, 65, 882 P.2d 703, 891 P.2d 718 (1994)). Where possible, we harmonize clauses that seem to conflict in order to give effect to all of the contract\u2019s provisions. Realm, Inc. v. City of Olympia, 168 Wn. App. 1, 5, 277 P.3d 679 (2012). \u201cEvery insurance contract shall be construed according to the entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the policy, and as amplified, extended, or modified by any rider, endorsement, or application attached to and made a part of the policy.\u201d RCW 48.18.520.\n\u00b611 In this case, the language of the Luis\u2019 insurance policy, including the endorsement, is plain\u2014it did not cover water damage. Specifically, reading the endorsement, the average insured would understand by the policy\u2019s plain language that (1) the endorsement\u2019s terms supersede the terms of the underlying policy, (2) the endorsement\u2019s first paragraph excluded all coverage after 60 days of vacancy, and (3) the endorsement\u2019s second paragraph provided only limited coverage from when the building first became vacant up until 60 days of that vacancy. Because the language of the policy is plain, we enforce that language.\nA. Description of the endorsement\n\u00b612 The endorsement to the Luis\u2019 insurance policy stated in relevant part:\nCHANGE IN CONDITIONS ENDORSEMENT\nPlease read carefully as this changes coverage under your policy.\nVACANCY OR UNOCCUPANCY\nCoverage under this policy is suspended while a described building, whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant, is vacant or unoccupied beyond a period of sixty consecutive days, unless permission for such vacancy or unoccupancy is granted hereon in writing and an additional premium is paid for such vacancy or unoccupancy.\nEffective at the inception of any vacancy or unoccupancy, the Causes of Loss provided by this policy are limited to Fire, Lightning, Explosion, Windstorm or Hail, Smoke, Aircraft or Vehicles, Riot or Civil Commotion, unless prior approval has been obtained from the Company.\n\u00b613 This endorsement superseded the original terms of the underlying insurance policy. Insurance policies may be \u201camplified, extended, or modified by any . . . endorsement . . . attached to and made a part of the policy.\u201d RCW 48.18.520. \u201cAn endorsement becomes a part of the insurance contract even if the result is a new and different contract. As endorsements are later in time, they generally control over inconsistent terms or conditions in a policy.\u201d Transcon. Ins. Co. v. Wash. Pub. Utils. Dists.\u2019 Util. Sys., 111 Wn.2d 452, 462, 760 P.2d 337 (1988). By its plain language, the endorsement changed the terms of the underlying policy. In italicized letters, the endorsement asked the insured to \u201c\\p]lease read carefully as this changes coverage under your policy.\u201d Because the endorsement changed the terms of the underlying insurance policy, the terms of the endorsement control.\n\u00b614 Despite the plain language of the endorsement, the Luis argue that an ambiguity exists between the endorsement\u2019s two paragraphs. We therefore analyze the operative language of the endorsement and its meaning.\nB. Plain language and meaning of terms of the endorsement\n\u00b615 The plain language of the endorsement provides that whenever an insured building becomes vacant, insurance coverage is limited, and that after 60 days of vacancy, insurance coverage is suspended. \u201c[I]f the policy language is clear and unambiguous, we must enforce it as written; we may not modify it or create ambiguity where none exists.\u201d Quadrant Corp. v. Am. States Ins. Co., 154 Wn.2d 165, 171, 110 P.3d 733 (2005). Language in an insurance contract is ambiguous if it is susceptible to two different but reasonable interpretations. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Ruiz, 134 Wn.2d 713, 722, 952 P.2d 157 (1998). If an insurance contract contains an ambiguity,\nwe may rely on extrinsic evidence of the intent of the parties to resolve the ambiguity. Any ambiguity remaining after examination of the applicable extrinsic evidence is resolved against the insurer and in favor of the insured. But while exclusions should be strictly construed against the drafter, a strict application should not trump the plain, clear language of an exclusion such that a strained or forced construction results.... [I]n Washington the expectations of the insured cannot override the plain language of the contract.\nQuadrant Corp., 154 Wn.2d at 171-72 (citations omitted).\n\u00b616 We begin with the plain language of the first paragraph. It states that \u201c[c]overage under this policy is suspended while a described building ... is vacant.. . beyond a period of sixty consecutive days\u201d unless the insured pays an additional premium and Essex agrees to the vacancy. The underlying policy defines \u201cvacant.\u201d When a term is defined in a policy, that definition applies throughout the policy. See Kitsap County v. Allstate Ins. Co., 136 Wn.2d 567, 576, 964 P.2d 1173 (1998) (\u201cIf terms are defined in a policy, then the term should be interpreted in accordance with that policy definition.\u201d). In this case, the policy defines \u201cvacant\u201d in the following provision:\n6. Vacancy\na. Description of Terms\n(1) As used in this Vacancy Condition, the term building and the term vacant have the meanings set forth in . . . (l)(b) below:\n(b) When this policy is issued to the owner or general lessee of a building, building means the entire building. Such building is vacant unless at least 31% of its total square footage is:\n(i) Rented to a lessee or sub-lessee and used by the lessee or sub-lessee to conduct its customary operations; and/or\n(ii) Used by the building owner to conduct customary operations.\n(2) Buildings under construction or renovation are not considered vacant.\nTherefore, a condition to the first paragraph of the endorsement becoming effective is that less than 31 percent of the building is being rented or used for its customary operations, unless it is under construction or renovation.\n\u00b617 The first paragraph of the endorsement also contains the terms \u201csuspended\u201d and \u201cbeyond,\u201d which are not defined within the policy. We give undefined terms in an insurance policy their popular and ordinary meaning in accord with the understanding of the average purchaser of insurance, which we may determine by reference to dictionary definitions. Queen City Farms, Inc., 126 Wn.2d at 77. The ordinary meaning of \u201csuspended\u201d to the average insured is that there is no insurance coverage \u201cbeyond\u201d 60 days of vacancy. Indeed, the dictionary definition of \u201csuspended\u201d is \u201ctemporarily debarred, inactive, inoperative : held in abeyance.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2303 (2002). Similarly, the average insured would understand \u201cbeyond\u201d to mean after the 60 days of vacancy, which is again confirmed by the dictionary definition. See id. at 210 (\u201cbeyond\u201d means \u201cfarther away or farther along in space, time, or any developing temporal activity\u201d). Therefore, the average insured would understand that the first paragraph of the endorsement ends all insurance coverage if less than 31 percent of the building has been rented or used for its customary operations for more than 60 consecutive days.\n\u00b618 We turn now to the plain language of the endorsement\u2019s second paragraph: \u201cEffective at the inception of any vacancy ... , the Causes of Loss provided by this policy are limited to Fire, Lightning, Explosion, Windstorm or Hail, Smoke, Aircraft or Vehicles, Riot or Civil Commotion, unless prior approval has been obtained from the Company.\u201d While not defined in the Luis\u2019 policy, we have ruled that the average insured would understand the term \u201cinception\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018an act, process, or instance of beginning.\u2019\u201d Panorama Vill. Condo. Owners Ass\u2019n Bd. of Dirs. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 144 Wn.2d 130, 139, 26 P.3d 910 (2001) (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1141 (1981)). Therefore, by the plain language of the second paragraph, the endorsement provides only limited coverage at the moment the building becomes vacant (meaning that less than 31 percent of the building is rented or used for its customary operations).\nC. Structure and policy\n\u00b619 Reading the endorsement\u2019s two paragraphs together, the average insured would understand that the endorsement alters the underlying insurance policy to the extent that when a building becomes vacant, the policy provides limited coverage and, after a 60 consecutive day vacancy, the policy provides no coverage.\n\u00b620 The policy reasoning for vacancy provisions supports this plain language reading. Potentially damaging conditions in a vacant building are more likely to go undiscovered. See Rojas v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., 267 Neb. 922, 929-30, 678 N.W.2d 527 (2004). The longer a building is vacant, the greater the risk and the greater the damage if there is a condition causing damage. Id. Therefore, it makes sense that a vacancy endorsement would limit coverage for the first 60 days of a vacancy and then exclude all coverage if the building remains vacant after 60 days. Indeed, the facts of this case highlight the risks to a vacant building and why an insurance company would include such a vacancy endorsement. Because the Luis\u2019 building was vacant, the water leak went unnoticed until someone called the fire department to report \u201cwater coming from a building.\u201d Had the Luis or a tenant occupied the building, the response time and resulting damage may have been reduced.\n\u00b621 The Luis argue that the structure of the endorsement leads to a different conclusion. The Luis assert that the endorsement can reasonably be read to mean that there are no coverage consequences at all until after 60 days of vacancy. The Luis make this argument based on the order of the two paragraphs of the endorsement\u2014that the first paragraph is the \u201cdominant concept\u201d of the endorsement and controls the reading of the second paragraph. Specifically, the Luis state that because the first paragraph prescribes the coverage consequences of 60 days of vacancy, the second paragraph can reasonably be read as also not effective until after 60 days of vacancy.\n\u00b622 The Luis also contend that their interpretation of the vacancy endorsement harmonizes with the Vacancy Provisions of the underlying policy. The Vacancy Provisions of the underlying policy state that\n[i]f the building where loss or damage occurs has been vacant for more than 60 consecutive days before that loss or damage occurs:\n(1) We will not pay for any loss or damage caused by any of the following even if they are Covered Causes of Loss: . . .\n(d) Water damage.\nThe Luis argue that the endorsement says that it only changes the policy, it does not say that it replaces it, and that their interpretation harmonizes the provisions of the entire policy.\n\u00b623 The Luis\u2019 interpretation of the endorsement is unreasonable because it ignores the plain language of the second paragraph and causes much of the endorsement\u2019s language to become superfluous. See Queen City Farms, Inc., 126 Wn.2d at 94 (refusing to interpret an insurance policy in a manner that would cause some of its terms to be superfluous and without meaning). If we were to accept the Luis\u2019 assertion that insurance consequences do not exist until after 60 days of vacancy, the phrase \u201ceffective, at the inception of any vacancy\u201d in the endorsement\u2019s second paragraph becomes meaningless in light of the first paragraph\u2019s statement that \u201ccoverage under this policy is suspended while a described building ... is vacant or unoccupied beyond a period of sixty consecutive days.\u201d The Luis\u2019 interpretation of the endorsement further creates an unresolvable contradiction where the first paragraph would cause all coverage to be suspended while the second paragraph would simultaneously provide limited coverage.\n\u00b624 The Luis\u2019 argument that their interpretation harmonizes with the Vacancy Provisions is similarly unreasonable. While the Vacancy Provisions section of the underlying policy may have excluded coverage for water damage only after 60 days of vacancy, the endorsement changes the terms of the policy to exclude coverage for water damage at the inception of any vacancy. See Transcon. Ins. Co., 111 Wn.2d at 462 (endorsement provisions control over underlying policy provisions if so stated in the endorsement). The Luis\u2019 argument is unavailing because it ignores the controlling nature of the endorsement. We must read the insur-anee policy as a whole, including endorsements that explicitly change the terms of the policy. RCW 48.18.520; see also Transcon. Ins. Co., 111 Wn.2d at 462. In this case, the endorsement excludes coverage for water damage in the first 60 days of a vacancy. To interpret these provisions to the contrary would cause the endorsement\u2019s language that it changes the underlying policy to either be superfluous or be in direct conflict with the Vacancy Provisions. See Quadrant Corp., 154 Wn.2d at 170 (we may not create an ambiguity where none exists). Because the Luis\u2019 interpretation of the endorsement and the overall insurance policy is unreasonable, it does not create an ambiguity that must be resolved in their favor.\n\u00b625 Lastly, the Luis claim that the Court of Appeals erred by inserting subjectivity into its analysis of whether the endorsement was ambiguous. Specifically, the Luis claim that the Court of Appeals inappropriately construed the policy based on what the court presumed the Luis knew about Essex\u2019s interpretation of the policy. In a footnote, the Court of Appeals elaborated on the fact that the Luis had a prior insurance policy with Essex in 2004, and that the coverage under that prior policy was partially suspended when Essex discovered that the insured building was vacant. Kut Suen Lui v. Essex Ins. Co., No. 72835-1-I, slip op. at 9 n.6 (Wash. Ct. App. Apr. 6, 2015) (unpublished), http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/728351.pdf (insurance agent explained to the Luis that coverage was restricted as soon as the building became vacant). From this prior experience, the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[t]he record shows the Luis were aware of Essex\u2019s interpretation of the policy in 2004 . ...\u201d Id.\n\u00b626 Although the Court of Appeals noted the Luis\u2019 prior knowledge in a footnote, the court did not base its analysis of ambiguity on their knowledge. Id. at 4-13. Indeed, the court\u2019s analysis focused solely on the plain language of the endorsement and the policy reasoning behind such endorse-merits. Id. Further, even if the Luis are correct in their assertion that the Court of Appeals inappropriately considered their prior understanding of the endorsement, it does not impact our resolution of this case. Our review of the insurance policy is de novo. Expedia, Inc., 180 Wn.2d at 802. As discussed above, our objective analysis of the insurance policy, considering the plain language as would be understood by an average insured, demonstrates that Luis\u2019 policy unambiguously excluded coverage for the water damage.\n\u00b627 Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal of the trial court\u2019s ruling construing the endorsement in favor of the Luis. The building was vacant. The Luis\u2019 policy endorsement did not cover water damage in a vacant building.\nIII. The Luis\u2019 Insurance Policy Unambiguously Defines \u201cVacancy\u201d\n\u00b628 As stated above, the only issue certified for appeal was whether the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment for the Luis on finding that the endorsement was internally ambiguous. However, for the first time on appeal, the Luis now ask that we hold that the term \u201cvacancy\u201d is ambiguous. We have discretion to decide whether we address an issue asserted for the first time on appeal. RAP 2.5(a). We choose to address the definition of \u201cvacancy\u201d because we need to look no further than the definitions section of the insurance policy.\n\u00b629 The Luis assert that the term \u201cvacancy\u201d in the insurance policy is undefined and ambiguous. Specifically, the Luis seem to argue that because the endorsement and the Vacancy Provisions do not \u201cexplicitly define \u2018vacancy,\u2019 \u201d we should hold the term is ambiguous and interpret it in their favor. The Luis advocate that we adopt a definition of \u201cvacancy\u201d that precludes a finding of vacancy if the building\u2019s owners maintain \u201ca continuous physical presence at the property.\u201d\n\u00b630 The Luis\u2019 argument is not well taken. The insurance policy defines a \u201cvacancy\u201d as follows: a \u201cbuilding is vacant unless at least 31% of its total square footage is: (i) [r]ented to a lessee or sub-lessee to conduct its customary operations; and/or (ii) [u]sed by the building owner to conduct customary operations.\u201d When an insurance policy defines a term, that definition applies throughout the policy. See Kitsap County, 136 Wn.2d at 576 (\u201cIf terms are defined in a policy, then the term should be interpreted in accordance with that policy definition.\u201d). The Luis offer no conflicting language from within the insurance policy to demonstrate that this definition is ambiguous.\nIV. We Decline To Exercise Our Discretion To Rule on Whether the Building Was under Renovation\n\u00b631 Alternatively, the Luis ask us to affirm the trial court\u2019s decision on the ground that the building was under renovation at the time of the loss and thus not \u201cvacant.\u201d The Court of Appeals refused to address this issue under the general rule that appellate courts will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. Kut Suen Lui, slip op. at 14 (quoting State v. McFarland, 127 Wn.2d 322, 332-33, 899 P.2d 1251 (1995); RAP 2.5(a)). Similarly, in response to the Luis\u2019 argument, Essex now asserts that the policy distinguishes between \u201cvacant\u201d and \u201cunoccupied\u201d property and that we should rule that the policy excluded coverage for the water damage because the building was \u201cunoccupied.\u201d We decline to consider these issues because they were not certified by the trial court for appeal and are not sufficiently developed for our review.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b632 We affirm the Court of Appeals. The plain language of the Luis\u2019 insurance policy, as modified by the endorsement, did not cover the water damage to their vacant building.\nMadsen, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Gonz\u00e1lez, Gordon McCloud, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nAfter modification, further reconsideration denied August 15, 2016.\nThe issues of waiver, estoppel, and bad faith are not before our court. Essex asked the Court of Appeals to review these issues, but the Court of Appeals refused on the basis that the issues were not properly before the court. Kut Suen Lui v. Essex Ins. Co., No. 72835-1-I, slip op. at 4 (Wash. Ct. App. Apr. 6, 2015) (unpublished), http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/728351.pdf. Essex does not raise these issues here.",

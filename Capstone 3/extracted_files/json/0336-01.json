        "text": "Stephens, J.\n\u00b61 Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (Sound Transit) condemned property owned by Airport Investment Company (AIC) in order to secure easements to construct and operate an elevated light rail. The parties could not agree on the amount of just compensation for the taking, so the matter proceeded to trial. AIC contends it is statutorily entitled to attorney fees because Sound Transit failed to make a valid settlement offer 30 days before trial. Specifically, AIC argues that the 30-day offer Sound Transit made did not reflect the reduced temporary construction easement it ultimately obtained, making the offer ineffective or resulting in a total abandonment of the condemnation. AIC also seeks a new trial, alleging the trial court erroneously allowed Sound Transit\u2019s counsel to question AIC\u2019s president, Sandra Oh, about the taking valuation of a nontestifying appraisal expert.\n\u00b62 We affirm the Court of Appeals. A condemnee is entitled to attorney fees under RCW 8.25.070(1)(a) only \u201c[i]f [the] condemnor fails to make any written offer in settlement\u201d at least 30 days before trial. Sound Transit made a timely settlement offer, which was not rendered ineffective by subsequent revisions to reduce the impact of its temporary construction easement. AIC\u2019s evidentiary objection is also unavailing: the trial court properly admitted Oh\u2019s testimony under ER 801(d)(2) as an admission of a party opponent.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\u00b63 Sound Transit is a regional transit organization authorized to construct and operate a high-capacity electric light rail system (Light Rail). RCW 81.112.010; Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 1-2. Pursuant to its statutory authority to condemn real property to construct the Light Rail, Sound Transit sought easements over property owned by AIC. The property consists of approximately 112,626 square feet of land area and is developed with a four-story, 130-room hotel constructed in 1988.\n\u00b64 In the condemnation action, Sound Transit sought to take a portion of the property for a permanent guideway easement (PGE) to construct the Light Rail along the property\u2019s western boundary. It also sought a temporary construction easement (TCE), which afforded Sound Transit a nonexclusive, three-year time period to construct the Light Rail and encumbered up to 3,882 square feet of the property. Except when Sound Transit required exclusive occupancy, the TCE afforded AIC the right to use the TCE area for any purpose that did not interfere with Sound Transit\u2019s construction activities.\n\u00b65 In May 2012, Sound Transit sent AIC a valuation offer of $142,300 for both easements. This offer was based on an initial valuation by its appraiser of $79,825 for the PGE, $46,600 for the TCE, and $15,875 for improvements. Sound Transit advised AIC that it had the right to obtain its own appraisal at Sound Transit\u2019s expense. Id. AIC exercised this right, and its appraiser valued the easements at $485,000. AIC submitted its appraisal to Sound Transit in July 2012 in a letter expressing its belief that it was entitled to $485,000 for the easements. Suppl. Br. of Resp\u2019t Sound Transit, App. A at 1. Rejecting AIC\u2019s valuation, Sound Transit asked AIC to reconsider its original offer.\n\u00b66 On June 14, 2013, 30 days before trial, Sound Transit made a written settlement offer to AIC of $463,500. The offer was for both the PGE and the TCE, and was marked \u201cFor Settlement Purposes Only.\u201d CP at 1334. The offer provided that it \u201cremain[ed] open until accepted, rejected, or until withdrawn by Sound Transit\u201d and was \u201cmade subject to Sound Transit\u2019s reservation of its right to reevaluate this offer and submit a revised 30-day offer if the pending trial date is continued.\u201d Id. The parties could not agree on the amount of just compensation due, and the matter proceeded to trial.\n\u00b67 On July 1, 2013, Sound Transit informed AIC that it would change the configuration of the TCE because it no longer needed to relocate the property\u2019s driveway to construct the Light Rail. That same day, Sound Transit provided AIC with an updated parcel map and updated right-of-way plan showing the change. The modification reduced the total TCE area by approximately 1,000 square feet. Suppl. Br. of Resp\u2019t Sound Transit at 3. These changes to the TCE were designed to ameliorate AIC\u2019s loss of business costs from the property\u2019s use as a parking lot. Notwithstanding the language in the TCE, Sound Transit communicated to AIC that its construction would require only sporadic use of the TCE area during the three-year period. Sound Transit did not revoke or reduce its settlement offer despite the reduced easement.\n\u00b68 AIC then filed a motion in limine, requesting that the trial court exclude any evidence that Sound Transit intended to use the TCE area for less than the entire three-year term. At oral argument on the motion, the trial court agreed with AIC that if Sound Transit had the right to exclusive use of the TCE area for the entire three-year term, it could not tell the jury that its actual use would be less. The trial court granted AIC\u2019s motion, \u201cprovided, however, this ruling . . . does not preclude [Sound Transit] from submitting a revised form of [TCE] providing for the actual time of use of the easement area.\u201d CP at 904.\n\u00b69 On the first day of trial, Sound Transit withdrew its 30-day settlement offer. With leave of the trial court, Sound Transit provided AIC with revised TCE language regarding time of use. This occurred after jury selection, but before opening statements. Although the revised TCE still provided a three-year easement term, it limited Sound Transit\u2019s exclusive use of the TCE to a maximum of 160 nonconsecutive days.\n\u00b610 AIC also moved in limine to exclude evidence of its July 2012 valuation letter stating that it was entitled to $485,000 for the easements. Sound Transit responded that it had no objection to AIC\u2019s motion so long as Sound Transit\u2019s first appraisal would also be excluded on the grounds that both parties\u2019 appraisals were for purposes of settlement negotiations. Finding that neither initial appraisal letter constituted a settlement offer under ER 408 (and also rejecting AIC\u2019s claim of work product privilege), the trial court ruled that AIC and Sound Transit could \u201cfigure out if you want to get into this history [of the first appraisals]. If one of you does, the other one can.\u201d Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (July 16, 2013) at 53-54. Accordingly, the trial court did not \u201cgrant [ ] this motion on either side.\u201d Id. at 55.\n\u00b611 At trial, Sound Transit\u2019s appraisal expert, Murray Brackett, testified that the PGE was worth $113,169, the TCE was worth $61,503, and AIC was not entitled to severance damages. VRP (July 24, 2013) at 1072, 1094. AIC\u2019s appraisal expert, Scott Biethan, testified that the PGE was worth $210,000, the TCE was worth $32,124, and AIC was entitled to $1,457,000 for diminished value, totaling $1,699,124 in just compensation due. VRP (July 29, 2013) at 1502-03.\n\u00b612 During its case in chief, Sound Transit called AIC president Oh to testify about the July 2012 valuation letter. Before doing so, Sound Transit inquired about possible avenues to introduce the letter into evidence. The court advised, \u201cI think to get this document in you need to lay a foundation. I don\u2019t know how to be more clear than that. I don\u2019t read the case law as saying that apparent authority is enough to introduce a party admission. The whole policy of the rule here is it needs to be the party\u2019s statement . . . .\u201d VRP (July 25, 2013) at 1190.\n\u00b613 When Sound Transit began to question Oh about the contents of AIC\u2019s valuation letter, the trial court excused the jury to question the witness:\nTHE COURT: Was there a belief that you were entitled to $485,000 for just compensation?\nMS. OH: Whatever was in the appraisal and what the appraiser came up with with -\nTHE COURT: Is that an accurate statement, Ms. Oh? Did you believe you\u2019re entitled to $485,000? When you said it in July, was that an accurate statement about what your belief was?\nMS. OH: My belief was whatever the appraiser said was -\nTHE COURT: Yes. Focus on the letter and the date and tell me if this was your belief.\nMS. OH: Well, that was my belief from the information from the appraiser.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Thank you. May I have this?\nMS. OH: Oh, sorry.\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m going to let you question her about this letter -\nTHE COURT: ... I do think it\u2019s clear that this is a statement of something that she believed at the time and you can bring it in as her party admission.\nId. at 1202-03.\n\u00b614 AIC\u2019s counsel objected, arguing, \u201cI don\u2019t think we meet the hearsay exception.\u201d Id. at 1203. The trial judge responded, \u201cShe just said that this was her belief at the time. That\u2019s not hearsay. It\u2019s her belief. Let\u2019s bring in our jury.\u201d Id.\n\u00b615 Showing Oh AIC\u2019s July 2012 valuation letter, Sound Transit\u2019s counsel asked whether it was \u201c[AIC\u2019s] and your belief, strong belief, that [AIC] was entitled to a total of $485,000 for just compensation?\u201d Id. at 1205. When instructed by the trial judge to answer \u201cyes or no,\u201d Oh responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Id. at 1205-06.\n\u00b616 Sound Transit then moved to admit the AIC\u2019s valuation letter as an exhibit. The trial court denied the motion, stating, \u2018You have her testimony.\u201d Id. at 1206. The cross-examination and redirect examination did not address Oh\u2019s testimony concerning the $485,000 valuation figure. In closing argument, AIC\u2019s counsel referred the jury back to Oh\u2019s testimony as well as an earlier valuation estimate by Sound Transit\u2019s appraiser, saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to hold Ms. Oh to her number, then you hold Mr. Brackett to his first number as well.\u201d VRP (July 30, 2013) at 1766.\n\u00b617 At the close of trial, the jury awarded AIC $225,000 in just compensation for the two easements ($163,497 for the PGE and $61,503 for the TCE). The jury did not award diminished value damages. CP at 1000-04. AIC then filed a postverdict motion for attorney fees and costs under RCW 8.25.070(1)(a) and RCW 8.25.075(1)(b), arguing that when Sound Transit changed the size of the TCE and the durational language of the TCE, it either nullified the 30-day offer or abandoned the condemnation proceeding altogether. The trial court denied AIC\u2019s motion. AIC also moved for a new trial, which the trial court denied as untimely.\n\u00b618 AIC appealed the judgment and the trial court\u2019s order denying its motion for a new trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Cent. Puget Sound Reg\u2019l Transit Auth. v. Airport Inv. Co., No. 70958-5-1 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 26, 2015) (unpublished), http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/709585.pdf. We accepted review. Cent. Puget Sound Reg\u2019l Transit Auth. v. Airport Inv. Co., 185 Wn.2d 1017 (2015).\nANALYSIS\n\u00b619 This case presents two unrelated issues:\n(1) Whether AIC is statutorily entitled to attorney fees for going to trial on the just compensation issue because Sound Transit modified the TCE after it made its 30-day offer.\n(2) Whether the trial court erred by allowing Oh to be questioned about the taking valuation of a nontestifying expert contained in the July 2012 letter.\nAward of Fees under RCW 8.25.070(1)(a)\n\u00b620 The Washington State Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o private property shall be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation having been first made.\u201d Wash. Const. art. I, \u00a7 16. \u201cOriginally the determination of\u2018just compensation\u2019 was limited to an inquiry of the fair cash market value of the property involved.\u201d State v. Roth, 78 Wn.2d 711, 712, 479 P.2d 55 (1971). As \u201c[t]he necessary expense of litigation often forced property owners to accept the condemnor\u2019s offer even though they felt it was not just compensation,\u201d the legislature in 1965 \u201cenacted several statutory changes to rectify the situation.\u201d Id.\n\u00b621 Two years later, in 1967, the legislature \u201ctook further steps to attain a measure of equality between \u2018just compensation\u2019 and the condemnee\u2019s net compensation\u201d by passing RCW 8.25.070. Id. at 713. RCW 8.25.070(1) governs the award of attorney fees, providing in pertinent part:\n[I]f a trial is held for the fixing of the amount of compensation to be awarded to the owner or party having an interest in the property being condemned, the court shall[] award the condemnee reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and reasonable expert witness fees in the event of any of the following:\n(a) If condemnor fails to make any written offer in settlement to condemnee at least thirty days prior to commencement of said trial; or\n(b) If the judgment awarded as a result of the trial exceeds by ten percent or more the highest written offer in settlement. . . by condemnor in effect thirty days before the trial.\n\u00b622 Relying on RCW 8.25.070(1)(a), AIC argues it is entitled to attorney fees because Sound Transit did not make a written offer for the precise interest in the property it ultimately condemned. Suppl. Br. by AIC at 5-6. Specifically, AIC contends that Sound Transit did not make an offer that matched the revised TCE. As a result, AIC complains it was prevented from having \u201cthe opportunity to receive and consider a settlement offer for the reduced taking and from evaluating Sound Transit\u2019s case as it would be presented to the jury.\u201d Id. at 2.\n\u00b623 Statutory interpretation presents a legal question we review de novo. State v. Costich, 152 Wn.2d 463, 470, 98 P.3d 795 (2004). Our analysis of RCW 8.25.070 begins with the plain language employed by the legislature. Id. The plain meaning of a statute may be discerned \u201cfrom all that the Legislature has said in the statute and related statutes which disclose legislative intent about the provision in question.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 11, 43 P.3d 4 (2002). Our primary goal is to give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent, which we derive by construing the language as a whole, giving effect to every provision. State v. J.P., 149 Wn.2d 444, 450, 69 P.3d 318 (2003). If the language is unambiguous, we give effect to that language and that language alone because we presume the legislature says what it means and means what it says. State v. Radan, 143 Wn.2d 323, 330, 21 P.3d 255 (2001).\n\u00b624 The trial court correctly denied AIC attorney fees under RCW 8.25.070(1)(a). This provision entitles a con-demnee to attorney fees under RCW 8.25.070(1)(a) only if the condemnor fails to make any written offer in settlement at least 30 days before trial to fix compensation. Because it is undisputed that Sound Transit made a timely written settlement offer to AIC for $463,500, AIC\u2019s claim for attorney fees fails under the plain meaning of the statute. The text does not allow for an interpretation that vitiates the meaning of \u201cany offer\u201d when the scope of the taking is modified subsequent to the offer. AIC cannot invoke RCW 8.25.070(1)(a) for an award of attorney fees.\n\u00b625 AIC contends that Sound Transit\u2019s settlement offer was effectively no offer at all because it was based on a different property interest than the one Sound Transit ultimately sought to condemn per the revised TCE. But this argument runs contrary to the overall statutory scheme: RCW 8.25.070(1)(a) awards attorney fees to the condemnee only if condemnor fails to make \u201cany written offer in settlement\u201d of the condemnation action, anticipating ongoing attempts at settlement. (Emphasis added.) AIC\u2019s proposed interpretation renders the statute unworkable. It would prevent a condemnor from making any change to the property interests comprising the overall taking any time after the initial 30-day offer, at the risk of paying the condemnee\u2019s attorney fees and expert witness fees (unless perhaps the condemnor is able to have the trial continued and submit a new offer for the modified taking). AIC had a full and fair opportunity to accept Sound Transit\u2019s settlement offer\u2014which offer remained unchanged despite the reduced size and scope of the TCE.\n\u00b626 AIC worries that RCW 8.25.070(1)(a) will be subject to abuse\u2014through gamesmanship or bad faith\u2014if condem-nors are allowed to modify the scope of a taking at trial after making a settlement offer. We find AIC\u2019s concerns misplaced. Our precedent requires a condemnor to present an adequate taking description to allow the landowner time to prepare for trial. See In re Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle, 67 Wn.2d 923, 928, 410 P.2d 790 (1966). Here, AIC has not shown that the modified TCE was inadequately described or otherwise resulted in prejudice to its trial preparations. Nor did AIC present evidence that Sound Transit committed bad faith or engaged in gamesmanship in its settlement negotiations. Instead, the record discloses that Sound Transit reduced the scope of the TCE based on a changed understanding of its construction needs and to ameliorate AIC\u2019s concerns about decreased parking. Despite the scaled-back TCE, it kept the same settlement offer on the table until trial.\n\u00b627 An additional statutory safeguard exists against the risk of gamesmanship and abuse from condemnors proffering unreasonable settlement offers to avoid paying fees. RCW 8.25.070(1)(b) separately awards fees to the condem-nee when the condemnor\u2019s offer is less than 90 percent of the jury\u2019s just compensation verdict. In this case, the jury awarded AIC more compensation for the revised TCE than AIC\u2019s appraiser testified it was worth. CP at 1415. AIC suggests condemnors will have an incentive to make an inflated pretrial settlement offer based on a greater taking than ultimately sought at trial in order to avoid an award of fees under RCW 8.25.070(1)(b). Not only did AIC not rely on this provision in its fee motion, but the argument also overlooks the counterincentive a condemnor has to offer in settlement only that amount justified by the taking it actually needs. It is difficult to imagine that condemnors will generally be motivated to make artificially high settlement offers.\n\u00b628 Alternatively, AIC argues that it is entitled to fees and costs under RCW 8.25.075(1)(b) because Sound Transit\u2019s change to the scope of the TCE constituted an abandonment of the condemnation proceedings altogether. Suppl. Br. by AIC at 6-7; see RCW 8.25.075(1)(b) (providing for reasonable attorney and expert witness fees if \u201c[t]he proceeding is abandoned by the condemnor\u201d). AIC contends that Sound Transit abandoned its taking by modifying the TCE after its settlement offer and putting before the jury a different taking from the one for which it petitioned and obtained possession and actual use. Suppl. Br. by AIC at 6-7. In support of this argument, AIC cites to the TCE\u2019s reduction in square footage and duration of use. Id. at 9.\n\u00b629 We find this argument unpersuasive. The very fact that the parties litigated to judgment over just compensation establishes that the proceeding was never abandoned. AIC advocates for a rule that would consider a condemnation proceeding to be abandoned whenever the taking \u201cmaterially changes.\u201d But such a rule is contrary to established precedent holding that a proceeding is abandoned when the condemnor never takes any property. See Port of Grays Harbor v. Citifor, Inc., 123 Wn.2d 610, 619, 869 P.2d 1018 (1994) (holding condemnor \u201cclearly abandoned the condemnation proceedings\u201d under RCW 8.25.075(1)(b) because it never acquired property).\n\u00b630 Even if we were inclined to adopt a new rule akin to constructive abandonment, the out-of-state authorities AIC relies on are distinguishable. See Appellant AIC\u2019s Opening Br. at 41 n.3. In those cases, the physical taking changed in size and scope. See People ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. N. Tr. Co., 59 Ill. App. 3d 1053, 1054, 376 N.E.2d 286, 17 Ill. Dec. 287 (1978) (condemnor modified original physical taking of 312.5 square feet to 50.0 square feet, an 84 percent decrease); County of Kern v. Galatas, 200 Cal. App. 2d 353, 354-55, 19 Cal. Rptr. 348 (1962) (condemnor modified original physical taking of 75.49 acres to 48.87 acres, a 35 percent decrease); Montgomery County v. McQuary, 26 Ohio Misc. 239, 240, 265 N.E.2d 812 (1971) (condemnor \u201cabandoned [ed] the course of the easements through the property of the defendant . . . and designate [d] a different course\u201d); FKM P\u2019ship, Ltd. v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Houston Sys., 255 S.W.3d 619 (Tex. 2008) (condemnor modified original physical taking of 47,008 square feet to 1,260 square feet, a 97 percent decrease). Here, in contrast, Sound Transit made no reduction to its permanent taking (the PGE); the only change was to reduce the area impacted by the TCE by 25 percent and to limit its duration to fewer nonconsecutive days of exclusive possession. Moreover, Sound Transit\u2019s settlement offer never changed despite the reduced TCE. The Court of Appeals properly rejected AIC\u2019s claim that it is entitled to attorney fees under RCW 8.25.075(1)(b).\nAdmission of Oh\u2019s Testimony regarding the July 2012 Valuation\n\u00b631 AIC sought a new trial on the ground that the trial court erred by admitting Oh\u2019s testimony that she believed AIC was entitled to $485,000 for the easements. Suppl. Br. by AIC at 13-14. AIC contends this testimony \u201cwas not admissible because it contained not Ms. Oh\u2019s own belief of value, but the belief of value of an expert who was not in court.\u201d Id. at 15. The trial court admitted the testimony under ER 801(d)(2).\n\u00b632 We review a trial court\u2019s interpretation of an evidentiary rule de novo. State v. DeVincentis, 150 Wn.2d 11, 17, 74 P.3d 119 (2003). Once the rule is correctly interpreted, the trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude the evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Id. A trial court abuses its discretion only if its decision is manifestly unreasonable or based on untenable grounds. Wash. State Physicians Ins. Exch. & Ass\u2019n v. Fisons Corp., 122 Wn.2d 299, 339, 858 P.2d 1054 (1993).\n\u00b633 A statement qualifies as an admission by a party opponent if the \u201cstatement is offered against a party and is (i) the party\u2019s own statement, in either an individual or a representative capacity!,] or (ii) a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth.\u201d ER 801(d)(2). Such an admission is not hearsay. Id.\n\u00b634 The trial court properly admitted Oh\u2019s testimony. Before allowing Oh to be questioned about the July 2012 valuation letter, the trial judge asked Oh whether the letter reflected her belief that AIC was entitled to $485,000 for damages. She confirmed that it did and later repeated this belief in her testimony before the jury. There is no dispute that Oh, as AIC\u2019s president, was entitled to speak on AIC\u2019s behalf. Oh\u2019s statement regarding her belief as to the value in July 2012 was clearly offered against AIC. And the fact that that the letter containing the $485,000 valuation was never admitted at trial is of no consequence. Admission of a statement by a party opponent does not hinge on admitting documents corroborating the party opponent\u2019s statement. Because Oh manifested a belief in the truth of the $485,000 valuation, the trial court properly considered it to be her statement under ER 801(d)(2).\n\u00b635 AIC nevertheless contends the trial court improperly admitted Oh\u2019s testimony because, as a lay witness, \u201c[s]he never expressed any expertise or method by which she came to personally believe that the property was worth any particular amount. She expressly testified she solely relied on her appraiser.\u201d Suppl. Br. by AIC at 15. Her testimony, AIC argues, was used merely as a conduit to bring in the out-of-court valuation opinion of a nontest-ifying appraisal expert. See SentinelC3, Inc. v. Hunt, 181 Wn.2d 127, 139 n.5, 331 P.3d 40 (2014) (rejecting admission of expert witnesses\u2019 valuation opinion put into evidence through party\u2019s testimony because the valuations \u201cwere based entirely on a consulting expert\u2019s valuation that \u2018constituted hearsay\u2019 \u201d (quoting SentinelC3, Inc. v. Hunt, 176 Wn.2d 152, 162, 309 P.3d 582 (2013))). It is true that allowing Oh\u2019s testimony brought into evidence the fact of an earlier, lower appraisal obtained by AIC. The jury certainly understood that Oh\u2019s belief was based on this appraisal valuation. CP at 952. But the trial court\u2019s questioning of Oh revealed that she had adopted the valuation as her own belief, making it admissible as a statement of a party opponent. No requirement exists that the party opponent must possess particular \u201cexpertise or method\u201d in forming an opinion. ER 801(d)(2)(ii) requires only that the party \u201chas manifested an adoption or belief in [the statement\u2019s] truth.\u201d The trial court properly rejected AIC\u2019s hearsay objection and admitted the evidence. AIC is not entitled to a new trial.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b636 We affirm the Court of Appeals. AIC is not entitled to attorney fees under RCW 8.25.070(1)(a) or (b), and the trial court properly allowed AIC\u2019s president to be questioned about the July 2012 valuation letter.\nMadsen, C.J., and Owens, Fairhurst, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nThe TCE area included a space Sound Transit\u2019s contractor would need only if the guideway column placement required the property\u2019s driveway to be relocated. AIC was concerned about the size of the TCE because it would reduce available parking at the hotel, eliminating approximately 25 parking spaces.\nSound Transit alleges that when it had made the 30-day offer, the parties had already discussed Sound Transit\u2019s plan to reduce the TCE square footage and to use only a limited number of exclusive-use days to partially accommodate AIC\u2019s parking concerns.\nAIC claimed that Sound Transit refused to commit to any altered term description at this time. Suppl. Br. by AIC at 3; Pet. for Review by AIC at 3-4.\nThe trial court agreed with Sound Transit that as a matter of law, the lost income and consequential damages AIC claimed were not compensable.\nIn 1965, the legislature enacted RCW 8.25.010 (requiring condemnor to serve on condemnee a written offer showing the amount of total compensation it will settle for 30 days before trial), RCW 8.25.020 (requiring condemnor to cover, in addition to the fair market value of the property, actual and reasonable expenditures incurred by the condemnee in the process of evaluating the condemnor\u2019s offer), former RCW 8.25.030 (repealed by Laws of 1971, Ex. Sess., ch. 240, \u00a7 22) (giving trial court discretion to award the condemnee reasonable attorney and expert witness fees if the condemnor abandons the proceedings after entry of an order of public use and necessity), and former RCW 8.25.040 (repealed by Laws of 1971, Ex. Sess., ch. 240, \u00a7 22) (requiring condemnor to pay a limited amount for the actual reasonable expenses necessarily incurred by the condemnee in removing his personal property from the appropriated property).\nIn 1971, the legislature amended RCW 8.25.070 to state that the court \u201cshall\u201d award fees instead of the court \u201cmay\u201d award fees. Laws of 1971, Ex. Sess., ch. 39, \u00a7 3.\nAIC relies on State v. Basin Development & Sales Co., 53 Wn.2d 201, 204-05, 332 P.2d 245 (1958), for the proposition that \u201c The burden is on the condemnor to present sufficient construction plans to understand the extent of the loss to the owner.\u2019 \u201d Pet. for Review by AIC at 15 (quoting Basin, 53 Wn.2d at 204-05). But Basin is inapposite. In Basin, the trial court denied the condemnor\u2019s motion to stipulate to a new condemnation after the verdict had already been rendered. Basin, 53 Wn.2d at 204. Here, AIC had the opportunity to accept Sound Transit\u2019s unchanged settlement offer even after Sound Transit indicated there would be a downward modification of the TCE.\nIn accord with Washington precedent, courts have narrowly construed \u201cabandonment\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4654(a)(2), the federal analog to RCW 8.25.075. United States v. 122.00 Acres of Land, 856 F.2d 56 (8th Cir. 1988) (proceeding deemed abandoned when condemnor determined that the jury\u2019s determination of just compensation went beyond its budget capabilities and moved to dismiss the condemnation action all together); United States v. 4.18 Acres of Land, 542 F.2d 786 (9th Cir. 1976) (condemnation proceeding not deemed abandoned when condemnee successfully moved to dismiss the action and rather than appeal the dismissal the condemnor proceeded to file a new condemnation action within one year of dismissal); United States v. 431.60 Acres of Land, 355 F. Supp. 1093 (S.D. Ga. 1973) (government admitted to abandonment).\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent an inquiry to the judge, asking how to \u201cconsider the estimate from a third appraiser, who was briefly mentioned? We think that estimate was $485,000. Can we consider this as evidence or witness testimony?\u2019\u2019 CP at 952. The judge responded, \u201cYou may consider all the testimony and exhibits that were admitted into evidence, and assign it what weight you believe it is worth.\u2019\u2019 Id. 953.",

        "text": "Johnson, J.\n\u00b637 (dissenting) \u2014 In this classic bait-and-switch case, Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (Sound Transit) changed its condemnation claim during trial from what it told the property owner when the \u201csettlement\u201d offer was conveyed. No offer was ever \u201con the table\u201d for property interest claimed during trial. The offer caused, if not compelled, the property owner to seek fair value for their property at trial, where Sound Transit essentially said, \u201cNever mind, we do not need that much property, and therefore settlement should be for a lesser fair value for the condemned property interest.\u201d Torturing the statutory purpose, the majority denies the property owner fees and costs even though no offer was ever made for the property Sound Transit actually took. Under the statute as written, this \u201cchanging the rules after the game is played\u201d is unsupportable, or should be. The majority\u2019s new rule encourages such gamesmanship. I dissent.\n\u00b638 The majority incorrectly denies Airport Investment Company (AIC) its statutory entitlement to attorney fees. A straightforward reading of the statute discloses that any \u201coffer\u201d must be for the \u201cinterest in the property being condemned.\u201d RCW 8.25.070(1)(a). The majority essentially rewrites this provision and untethers the \u201coffer\u201d from the \u201cinterest in the property being condemned,\u201d defying common sense and the most elementary of principles of statutory construction and contracts. Some relationship must exist between a condemnor\u2019s offer and what it is taking. This case arose because Sound Transit changed its claim during trial.\n\u00b639 The majority erroneously concludes that because Sound Transit made \u201cany\u201d offer, no fee award is due under RCW 8.25.070(1). Public policy, legislative intent, and well-settled principles of statutory interpretation should mean that you cannot divorce the offer from the interest in the property by changing the claim after the \u201coffer\u201d was made and rejected. A straightforward application of the language of the statute requires that the \u201coffer\u201d be for the \u201cinterest in the property being condemned.\u201d No other reading makes sense.\n\u00b640 The purpose of RCW 8.25.070 is to encourage con-demnors to make fair offers, thus avoiding litigation and encouraging settlement before trial. See State v. Costich, 152 Wn.2d 463, 471, 98 P.3d 795 (2004). The majority at least acknowledges that our precedent requires a condem-nor to present an adequate taking description before trial to allow the landowner time to prepare for trial. Majority at 347 (citing In re Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle, 67 Wn.2d 923, 928, 410 P.2d 790 (1966) (Kenmore Props.)). It is true that a property owner before trial has a \u201cright to be adequately advised of the exact nature of the proposed taking, so that he [or she] may evaluate the resultant damage.\u201d Kenmore Props., 67 Wn.2d at 927. However, the majority\u2019s reading of Kenmore Properties ignores that the same reason why a property owner must be adequately informed of the exact nature of the taking before trial underlies why he or she must be informed of the exact nature of the taking when being given a settlement offer. It makes sense that a condemnor must provide the property owner a description of the taking to allow the landowner to make a decision to accept any offer and, if not, prepare for trial.\n\u00b641 For the property owner to determine if a settlement offer is fair\u2014and consequently whether to litigate the condemnation action\u2014the property owner must know what exactly Sound Transit is offering and what property interest Sound Transit is taking in exchange for that offer. Any change to what Sound Transit provides to the property owner makes the calculation impossible.\n\u00b642 Engaging in what is essentially a statutory rewrite, the majority claims that AIC failed to demonstrate that the temporary construction easement (TCE) was inadequately described, or that the changed TCE \u201cotherwise resulted in prejudice to its trial preparations,\u201d or that Sound Transit \u201ccommitted bad faith or engaged in gamesmanship in its settlement negotiations.\u201d Majority at 347. Under the majority\u2019s view, evidently, all the statute requires is that any offer \u201ccomes close\u201d to describing the property and, if so, the property owner must now prove some type of materiality or prejudice. Nowhere in the statute does it say this. What the statute says is that the offer must match the property interest sought. In this case, at trial, both the physical footprint and the duration changed from that specified in the offer. Whether this change was or was not \u201cmaterial\u201d to the property owner\u2019s decision can never be known with certainty. Nor should condemnation trials include this issue. One certainty is established: the property owner never had the decision to accept an offer never presented.\n\u00b643 The majority offers no cases to support its rule that a court must somehow consider materiality of any changes. Unfortunately, the majority fails to explain how the property owner can prove \u201cmateriality\u201d\u2014by what standard or much else. Fortunately, the statute answers this question. The statute provides that the burden is on Sound Transit to make offers for what it wants. Any change voids the offer.\n\u00b644 Even if it were, under the statute, appropriate to engage in such an inquiry, a taking reduced by both its physical footprint and a reduction in duration is a lesser taking. A lesser taking is material in relation to the evaluation of the offer of just compensation. Here, the original TCE allowed for exclusive use of up to 1,080 days; the new TCE narrowed that exclusive use to 160 days. The changes included a 25 percent decrease in the area of the easement and a reduction of the duration by 2.5 years. Sound Transit presented an entirely different picture of the taking to the jury than its pretrial offer had specified. Under the majority\u2019s approach, a condemnor can overstate its taking at the beginning of condemnation proceedings and then present the jury with a lesser taking to insulate itself from having to pay a fee award. While this likely was not the deliberate strategy of Sound Transit, the majority seems to ignore the possibility and risk of gamesmanship and abuse from its result, which conflicts with the statutory purposes.\n\u00b645 The majority claims RCW 8.25.070(1)(b)\u2014which separately awards fees to the condemnee when the condem-nor\u2019s offer is less than 90 percent of the jury\u2019s just compensation verdict\u2014provides a safeguard against the risk this potential abuse. Majority at 348. For this ostensible safeguard to be triggered, the jury award must necessarily be greater than the pretrial offer, which will almost never be the case when the property interest is reduced. In other words, RCW 8.25.070(1)(b) protects the condemnee only when the condemnor has offered less than what the jury awards. In instances where the pretrial offer is based on a taking that is less than the taking presented at trial\u2014 either by its duration or its physical amount or both, as is the case here\u2014then the jury award will never be less than the pretrial offer. Under the statute, this does not make sense. Apparently, no question in this case exists that had Sound Transit gone to trial on its original claim, the award would have been larger. Because of the difference, no comparison between the offer and the award can be done.\n\u00b646 The statute was designed to protect property owners who receive unfair settlement offers from bearing the costs of pursuing just compensation. Conversely, the statute was also designed to protect Sound Transit from bearing the costs of litigation when a fair offer of settlement is made. The property owner has a choice to make. If it decides to litigate, the statute determines fairness by comparing what was offered before trial to what the jury awarded. That comparison is simple where the taking on which the initial offer was based is the same as the taking evaluated by the jury. It becomes impossible and meaningless to compare the pretrial offer to the jury award where the property interests are different.\n\u00b647 Under the statute, an offer is inextricably linked to the property interest on which the offer is made. In this case, because the offer was for a different property interest than that sought at trial, it is simply void and AIC is statutorily entitled to recover its fees and costs. For these reasons, I dissent.\nWiggins and Gordon McCloud, JJ., concur with Johnson, J.\n\u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, if a trial is held for the fixing of the amount of compensation to be awarded to the owner or party having an interest in the property being condemned, the court shall award the condemnee reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and reasonable expert witness fees in the event of any of the following:\n\u201c(a) If condemnor fails to make any written offer in settlement to condemnee at least thirty days prior to commencement of said trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThe record does not disclose exactly when Sound Transit made this change. We can presume that trial preparations and discovery were complete and at the very least the appraisal was done.",

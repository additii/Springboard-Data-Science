        "text": "Johnson, J.\n\u00b61 This case involves whether under Washington State Constitution article I, section 7, an officer may search an arrestee\u2019s backpack as a search incident to arrest when the arrestee was wearing the backpack at the moment that he was stopped by police, but not at the time he was arrested several minutes later. When Officer Erik Olson stopped and seized Antoine Brock, he had Brock remove the backpack he was wearing and placed it where Brock could not readily access it. After a period of questioning, the officer arrested Brock and then searched the backpack. As long as 10 minutes may have lapsed between the time Olson separated Brock from his backpack and the arrest. The trial court denied Brock\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence taken from the backpack. The Court of Appeals reversed. State v. Brock, 182 Wn. App. 680, 330 P.3d 236 (2014), review granted, 181 Wn.2d 1029, 340 P.3d 228 (2015). Under the facts of this case, we hold that the backpack was a part of Brock\u2019s person at the time of arrest and reverse the Court of Appeals, upholding the search as a valid search incident to arrest.\nFacts\n\u00b62 Early in the morning, at approximately 3 a.m. on May 21, 2008, Officer Olson was patrolling Golden Gardens Park when he noticed the men\u2019s restroom door was open and the lights were on. The park was closed and had been since 11:30 p.m. As he approached the men\u2019s room, the officer could see a person\u2019s legs inside the stall. Officer Olson waited approximately 10 minutes before Brock emerged wearing baggy clothing and carrying a backpack.\n\u00b63 Olson identified himself as an officer and informed Brock that he was not allowed in the park. Although Olson had probable cause to arrest Brock for trespass at that moment, he did not. Instead, he had Brock remove his backpack and performed a Terry stop and frisk. Olson did not feel a wallet during the frisk. Brock explained that he did not have any identification but provided Olson with a name, Dorien Halley, and a corresponding birth date and Social Security number.\n\u00b64 Olson directed Brock to follow him to his patrol truck so he could run his name through the Washington database. For safety purposes, Olson carried the backpack and placed it on the passenger seat of his vehicle while Brock stood 12 to 15 feet away on the curb. Olson reminded Brock he was not under arrest at that time but that he was also not yet free to go.\n\u00b65 Brock indicated that he had a California license instead of a Washington license, so Olson ran the name through both the Washington and California databases. Neither search yielded any results. At that point, Olson read Brock his Miranda rights and arrested Brock for providing false information but explained to Brock that \u201che wasn\u2019t necessarily going to jail.\u201d Verbatim Report of Proceedings (June 13, 2011) at 56. Because Brock had been cooperative, Olson did not use handcuffs and instructed Brock just to remain near the curb while he returned to his truck to search the backpack for identification. Olson considered the backpack search \u201ca search of Brock\u2019s person incident to arrest\u201d for providing false information.\n\u00b66 In searching the backpack, Olson discovered a wallet containing two small \u201cbaggies\u201d of what appeared to be marijuana and methamphetamine. He also found a Department of Corrections (DOC) inmate identification card displaying Brock\u2019s photograph and identifying him as Antoine L. Brock. Olson walked back over to Brock, handcuffed him, and put him in the back of his patrol truck. Olson estimated that the entire encounter, from the time of the initial contact to the time he handcuffed Brock, was about 10 minutes.\n\u00b67 Olson then ran Brock\u2019s real name through the database and discovered that Brock had a DOC felony arrest warrant. Once Washington State Patrol confirmed the warrant, Olson had no choice but to take Brock to jail. Before doing so, Olson emptied the contents of the backpack in what he considered an inventory search prior to taking Brock to jail for booking. Olson explained that for safety reasons, he could not bring the backpack to the jail without first performing a search of the arrestee\u2019s personal effects for weapons or explosives. In his search, Olson discovered numerous checks, credit cards, mail, and more baggies possibly containing narcotics.\n\u00b68 Based on this evidence, the State charged Brock with 10 counts of identity theft in the second degree, 3 counts of forgery, and violation of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, chapter 69.50 RCW. Brock moved to suppress the evidence discovered in his backpack, which the trial court denied, concluding that the search was a valid search incident to arrest. Brock agreed to a stipulated facts bench trial and was found guilty on all counts except on one count of identity theft.\n\u00b69 Brock appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s suppression ruling under article I, section 7 of the Washington State Constitution. The State responded that the search was a valid search of Brock\u2019s person. The Court of Appeals reversed Brock\u2019s conviction, agreeing with Brock that it was not a valid search of his person under article I, section 7 because Brock did not have actual, exclusive possession of the backpack \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d arrest. Brock, 182 Wn. App. at 689.\nAnalysis\n\u00b610 Article I, section 7 of the Washington State Constitution provides for broad privacy protections for individuals and generally prohibits unreasonable police invasions into personal affairs. We presume that a warrant-less search of an individual\u2019s personal item, such as a backpack, violates these protections unless the search falls within \u201cone of the few \u2018carefully drawn and jealously guarded exceptions.\u2019\u201d State v. Byrd, 178 Wn.2d 611, 616, 310 P.3d 793 (2013) (quoting State v. Bravo Ortega, 177 Wn.2d 116, 122, 297 P.3d 57 (2013)). One such exception is a search incident to arrest, in which the arresting officer has authority to search the arrestee\u2019s person and his or her personal effects.\n\u00b611 There are two discrete types of searches incident to arrest: (1) a search of the arrestee\u2019s person (including those personal effects immediately associated with his or her person\u2014such as purses, backpacks, or even luggage) and (2) a search of the area within the arrestee\u2019s immediate control. A valid search of the latter requires justification grounded in either officer safety or evidence preservation\u2014 there must be some articulable concern that the arrestee can access the item in order to draw a weapon or destroy evidence. Byrd, 178 Wn.2d at 617 (citing Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1969)). The former search does not; in analyzing the search of an arrestee, we utilize the United States Supreme Court\u2019s rationale from the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution that \u201c \u2018a search may be made of the person of the arrestee by virtue of the lawful arrest.\u2019\u201d Byrd, 178 Wn.2d at 617 (quoting United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 224, 94 S. Ct. 467, 38 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1973)). In such cases, we presume that safety and evidence justifications exist when taking those personal items into custody as part of the arrestee\u2019s person.\n\u00b612 The distinction as to whether a particular personal item constitutes part of the arrestee\u2019s person, as opposed to just part of the surrounding area, turns on whether the arrestee had \u201cactual and exclusive possession at or immediately preceding the time of arrest.\u201d Byrd, 178 Wn.2d at 623. This is known as the \u201ctime of arrest\u201d rule. We have previously applied this rule in cases involving an arrestee who was holding the personal item at the precise moment of arrest. But here, because Brock was separated from his backpack several minutes prior to arrest, the issue involves the scope of \u201cimmediately preceding arrest.\u201d\n\u00b613 In Byrd, we analyzed this \u201ctime of arrest\u201d distinction between items that are part of the arrestee\u2019s \u201cperson\u201d and items merely within the arrestee\u2019s immediate control. Byrd involved the validity of a warrantless search of a car passenger\u2019s purse. At the time of arrest, Byrd held the purse in her lap, but when ordered to step out of the car, she asked to leave the purse in the car. The officers refused and seized her purse as part of the arrest. The purse was removed and searched separate from her person. We recognized that her physical distance from the bag dispelled any practical concerns that she could have reached the purse to draw a weapon or destroy evidence, but we upheld the search as a search of her \u201cperson.\u201d Unlike items in the immediately surrounding area, the officer does not need to articulate any objective safety or evidence preservation concerns before validly searching the item. We said that the officer\u2019s authority to search the purse flowed \u201cfrom the authority of [the] custodial arrest itself.\u201d Byrd, 178 Wn.2d at 618 (citing Robinson, 414 U.S. at 232). This authority satisfies article I, section 7\u2019s requirement that the incursions into private affairs be supported by \u201c\u2018authority of law.\u2019\u201d Byrd, 178 Wn.2d at 618 (quoting Wash. Const. art. I, \u00a7 7). The arrest provides the constitutional authority of law justifying the search.\n\u00b6 14 A second underlying justification for this \u201cpart of the person\u201d distinction is that there are presumptive safety and evidence preservation concerns associated with police taking custody of those personal items immediately associated with the arrestee, which will necessarily travel with the arrestee to jail. We said:\nThe time of arrest rule reflects the practical reality that a search of the arrestee\u2019s \u201cperson\u201d to remove weapons and secure evidence must include more than his literal person. . . . When police take an arrestee into custody, they also take possession of his clothing and personal effects, any of which could contain weapons and evidence.\nByrd, 178 Wn.2d at 621.\n\u00b615 Brock conflates the \u201ctime of arrest\u201d distinction by arguing that his physical separation from the backpack vitiated any practical safety or evidence preservation concerns associated with the backpack because he could not reach it, and that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Gant and our ruling in Valdez require that safety and evidence preservation concerns justify the search incident to arrest. However, as we recognized in Byrd, neither of the decisions in Gant or Valdez restricts the lawful search of an arrestee\u2019s person; there is no requirement that the arrestee be within the reach of the personal item once it is seized as part of the lawful arrest. We rejected Byrd\u2019s argument that her inability to access her purse affects the analysis.\n\u00b616 We applied this same analysis in State v. Mac-Dicken, 179 Wn.2d 936, 938-39, 319 P.3d 31 (2014), where we upheld the validity of a search of the arrestee\u2019s luggage, even when the luggage was moved a full car length\u2019s away from the arrestee\u2019s reach. When the personal item is taken into custody as a part of the arrestee\u2019s person, the arrestee\u2019s ability to reach the item during the arrest and search becomes irrelevant.\n\u00b617 Rather, the safety and evidence preservation exigencies that justify this \u201ctime of arrest\u201d distinction stem from the safety concerns associated with the officer having to secure those articles of clothing, purses, backpacks, and even luggage, that will travel with the arrestee into custody. Because those items are part of the person, we recognize the practical reality that the officer seizes those items during the arrest. From that custodial authority flows the officer\u2019s authority to search for weapons, contraband, and destructible evidence.\n\u00b618 In determining the scope of the phrase \u201cimmediately preceding,\u201d the Court of Appeals focused on the temporal component\u2014the time between Brock\u2019s exclusive possession and his arrest\u2014and determined that he did not possess the backpack \u201cimmediately\u201d before arrest because it sat in the patrol truck for nearly 10 minutes before Brock was arrested. The court distinguished these facts from other Washington cases where the arrestee\u2019s belongings were separated from the arrestee for a shorter period of time prior to the arrest. State v. Smith, 119 Wn.2d 675, 835 P.2d 1025 (1992); State v. Ellison, 172 Wn. App. 710, 291 P.3d 921 (2013), review denied, 180 Wn.2d 1014, 327 P.3d 55 (2014).\n\u00b619 In Smith, the arrestee\u2019s fanny pack fell from his person when he ran from the officer. The officer managed to catch and arrest Smith and secure him in handcuffs in her patrol car. The officer then walked back to retrieve the fanny pack and cleaned up strewn bottles around the scene. The officer returned to the patrol car, radioed in that she had custody of Smith, and searched the fanny pack approximately 9 to 17 minutes after the arrest. We held that the subsequent search of the fanny pack was a valid search incident to arrest because the fanny pack was worn by the arrestee moments before arrest and was therefore part of his seized person. We held that a 17-minute delay is also reasonable \u201cwhere the delay results solely from the officer\u2019s reasonable actions designed to secure the premises and to protect herself and the public.\u201d Smith, 119 Wn.2d at 683.\n\u00b620 In Ellison, officers responded to a 911 report of an unwanted, violent ex-boyfriend who refused to leave the caller\u2019s yard. When the officers searched her yard, they found the suspect, Ellison, hiding under a mound of blankets covering the patio furniture. He was sitting in a chair with a backpack between his feet. The officer ordered him out of the chair and to lie on the ground on his stomach. The officer then handcuffed Ellison, questioned him, and ran Ellison\u2019s name through the warrant search system. Once it was confirmed that Ellison had numerous outstanding arrest warrants, he was formally placed under arrest. Although the court did not discuss the precise duration, it is quite possible that Ellison was dispossessed of his backpack several minutes before arrest while the officers ran his name and information through their system. The Court of Appeals upheld the search as a valid search incident to arrest, acknowledging that the officers were reasonably concerned that the backpack might contain a live firearm and that \u201cleaving it at the scene or transporting it to jail in the trunk of their patrol car presented an unacceptable safety risk.\u201d Ellison, 172 Wn. App. at 722.\n\u00b621 The reviewing courts did not identify the exact duration, but it appears that in both cases at least a few minutes elapsed between separation and arrest. In this case, the Court of Appeals found the difference between a few minutes and approximately 10 minutes dispositive. In so holding, the court reiterated that the search incident to arrest exception is narrow and that 10 minutes simply cannot similarly be considered \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d arrest.\n\u00b622 The Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis misapprehends the purpose of the time of arrest rule. Although we must draw these exceptions to the warrant requirement narrowly, we do not draw them arbitrarily; the exception must track its underlying justification. Because the search incident to arrest rule recognizes the practicalities of an officer having to secure and transport personal items as part of the arrestee\u2019s person, we draw the line of \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d with that focus. The proper inquiry is whether possession so immediately precedes arrest that the item is still functionally a part of the arrestee\u2019s person. Put simply, personal items that will go to jail with the arrestee are considered in the arrestee\u2019s \u201cpossession\u201d and are within the scope of the officer\u2019s authority to search.\n\u00b623 Under these circumstances, the lapse of time had little practical effect on Brock\u2019s relationship to his backpack. Brock wore the backpack at the very moment he was stopped by Officer Olson. The arrest process began the moment Officer Olson told Brock that although he was not under arrest, he was also not free to leave. The officer himself removed the backpack from Brock as a part of his investigation. And, having no other place to safely stow it, Brock would have to bring the backpack along with him into custody. Once the arrest process had begun, the passage of time prior to the arrest did not render it any less a part of Brock\u2019s arrested person.\n\u00b624 We hold that when the officer removes the item from the arrestee\u2019s person during a lawful Terry stop and the Terry stop ripens into a lawful arrest, the passage of time does not negate the authority of law justifying the search incident to arrest.

        "text": "Gordon McCloud, J.\n\u00b625 (dissenting) \u2014 In State v. Byrd, 178 Wn.2d 611, 623, 310 P.3d 793 (2013), this court held that law enforcement must constrain their search of an arrestee\u2019s person, incident to arrest, to only \u201cthose personal articles in the arrestee\u2019s actual and exclusive possession at or immediately preceding the time of arrest.\u201d This case requires us to interpret the phrase \u201cimmediately preceding the time of arrest\u201d in order to determine the scope of the search incident to arrest exception to the warrant requirement.\n\u00b626 The majority holds that the exception authorizes the search of a backpack that the arresting officer reduced to his exclusive possession and control several minutes before he initiated any custodial arrest. Because this holding is inconsistent with the principles underlying the narrow search incident to arrest exception, I respectfully dissent.\n\u00b627 Under article I, section 7 of the Washington State Constitution, a warrantless search is per se unreasonable, subject to a few \u201ccarefully drawn and jealously guarded exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u201d State v. Bravo Ortega, 177 Wn.2d 116, 122, 297 P.3d 57 (2013) (citing State v. Afana, 169 Wn.2d 169, 176-77, 233 P.3d 879 (2010); State v. Patton, 167 Wn.2d 379, 386, 219 P.3d 651 (2009)). The search incident to arrest is one such exception. Byrd, 178 Wn.2d at 616.\n\u00b628 In Byrd, this court reasoned that the search incident to arrest exception encompassed two distinct applications: a search of the area within the control of the arrestee and a search of the arrestee\u2019s person. Id. at 617 (quoting United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 224, 94 S. Ct. 467, 38 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1973)). The Byrd court recognized that searches of an area incident to arrest must be supported by concerns that the arrestee could endanger officer safety or destroy evidence. Id. (citing Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1969)). But it held that searches of an arrestee\u2019s person require nothing more than a valid custodial arrest and that risks to officer safety and evidence preservation are presumed when an officer searches an arrestee\u2019s \u201cperson.\u201d Id. at 619-20 (citing Robinson, 414 U.S. at 224).\n\u00b629 To determine whether an article is considered part of an arrestee\u2019s person and thus per se searchable incident to arrest, this court applies the \u201ctime of arrest\u201d rule. Byrd, 178 Wn.2d at 620-21. According to this rule, \u201can article is \u2018immediately associated\u2019 with the arrestee\u2019s person, and can [therefore] be searched under Robinson,\u201d if it is a \u201cpersonal article! ] in the arrestee\u2019s actual and exclusive possession at or immediately preceding the time of arrest.\u201d Id. at 621, 623 (emphasis added).\n\u00b630 In this case, the majority cites two justifications for the \u201ctime of arrest\u201d rule, both of which the majority sees as reasons to approve the search at issue here. First, the majority argues that under Robinson, 414 U.S. at 224, a custodial arrest so diminishes the arrestee\u2019s expectations of privacy that the arrest itself\u2014absent any specifically articulated safety or evidence preservation concerns\u2014\u201cprovides the constitutional authority of law justifying the search.\u201d Majority at 155. Second, the majority argues that safety and evidence preservation concerns are always associated with any item that an officer must transport with the arrestee to the jail. Id. Neither of these arguments persuades me that we should expand our \u201ctime of arrest\u201d rule to encompass the search at issue in this case.\n\u00b631 The majority\u2019s second argument\u2014that an object always poses a danger when it must be transported to the jail\u2014stems from a misreading of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 806, 94 S. Ct. 1234, 39 L. Ed. 2d 771 (1974). In Byrd, the majority cited Edwards for the proposition that \u201c[w]hen police take an arrestee into custody, they also take possession of his clothing and personal effects, any of which could contain [a] weapon! ].\u201d 178 Wn.2d at 621 (citing Edwards, 415 U.S. at 806). In this case, the majority cites that part of Byrd for the proposition that \u201cthere are presumptive safety and evidence preservation concerns associated with . . . items . . . [that] will . . . travel with the arrestee to jail.\u201d Majority at 155 (quoting Byrd, 178 Wn.2d at 621). But Edwards was not a search incident to arrest case. On the contrary, Edwards held that law enforcement could search an arrestee\u2019s belongings several hours after they were transported to the place of detention. 415 U.S. at 801 (\u201cThe question here is whether the Fourth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] should be extended to exclude from evidence certain clothing taken from respondent Edwards while he was in custody at the city jail approximately 10 hours after his arrest.\u201d (emphasis added)). In fact, Edwards contradicts rather than supports the assertion that it is inherently dangerous to transport items before they are searched.\n\u00b632 The majority\u2019s other justification for the \u201ctime of arrest rule\u201d\u2014the diminution of the arrestee\u2019s privacy expectations\u2014stems from this court\u2019s exceedingly broad interpretation of Robinson. As I explained in my dissent to State v. MacDicken, the same presumptions govern a search under Chimel and a search under Robinson: the presumptions that an arrestee may be armed and may destroy evidence. 179 Wn.2d 936, 945, 319 P.3d 31 (2014). Robinson held that these presumptions apply in every custodial arrest, even where it is highly unlikely that the arrestee in fact possesses either arms or destructible evidence. Id. at 945; Riley v. California, _ U.S. _, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 2483-84, 189 L. Ed. 2d 430 (2014). Thus, under Robinson, officers may presume that a particular arrestee\u2014even one arrested for a nonviolent traffic offense\u2014is armed. 414 U.S. at 235. But officers may not presume that this arrestee can access items safely reduced to law enforcement\u2019s exclusive possession and control\u2014that is an entirely different presumption, one which the Supreme Court has never approved. See United States v. Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1, 15, 97 S. Ct. 2476, 53 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1977) (\u201cOnce law enforcement officers have reduced luggage or other personal property not immediately associated with the person of the arrestee to their exclusive control, and there is no longer any danger that the arrestee might gain access to the property to seize a weapon or destroy evidence, a search of that property is no longer an incident of the arrest.\u201d), abrogated on other grounds by California v. Acevedo, 500 U.S. 565, 111 S. Ct. 1982, 114 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1991)).\n\u00b633 It is true that some courts have applied Robinson to searches of personal items larger than the crumpled cigarette package at issue in that case\u2014for example, to the \u201cbillfold and address book[,] . . . walletf,] . . . [and] purse\u201d recently noted by the United States Supreme Court in Riley\u2014when these items were \u201ccarried by [the] arrestee.\u201d 134 S. Ct. at 2488 (emphasis added) (citing United States v. Carrion, 809 F.2d 1120, 1123, 1128 (5th Cir. 1987); United States v. Watson, 669 F.2d 1374, 1383-84 (11th Cir. 1982); United States v. Lee, 163 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 501 F.2d 890, 892 (1974)). But the Supreme Court has always described Robinson searches\u2014that is, searches of the person incident to arrest\u2014in extremely narrow terms. E.g., id. at 2489 (describing Robinson as permitting a search \u201cof an arrestee\u2019s pockets\u201d and leaving open the question of what other \u201cphysical items\u201d might be searchable under this exception). And it has always described those searches as \u201c \u2018based upon the need to disarm and to discover evidence,\u2019 \u201d even as it has explained that the validity of a Robinson search \u201c \u2018does not depend on . . . the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 2483 (quoting Robinson, 414 U.S. at 235).\n\u00b634 This court, by contrast, has incrementally expanded the search incident to arrest exception\u2014in one line of cases\u2014so that it no longer bears any logical relationship to the safety and evidence preservation concerns that underlie both Robinson and Chimel. In Byrd, the majority concluded that the defendant\u2019s purse was an extension of her person, even after officers had reduced the purse to their exclusive possession and control, solely because \u201c[t] he purse left Byrd\u2019s hands only after her arrest.\u201d 178 Wn.2d at 623-24. Subsequently, in MacDicken, this court reasoned that arresting officers could search the defendant\u2019s laptop bag and rolling duffel bag, both of which were least a car\u2019s length away from the defendant when officers began the search, because the defendant was holding the bags when the officers initiated the arrest. 179 Wn.2d at 939. In the present case, the majority holds that an officer may search a backpack that he reduced to his exclusive possession and control several minutes before he initiated the arrest. Majority at 152-53. Although the backpack posed no conceivable risk to officer safety or evidence preservation, the majority holds that the search was proper because, under Robinson, exigencies are presumed. Id. at 154, 159.\n\u00b635 In addition to misunderstanding the presumption approved in Robinson, this holding is contrary to two principles governing the search incident to arrest exception.\n\u00b636 The first principle is that \u201cthe proper scope of the time of arrest rule is narrow . .. [because a search incident to arrest is a] jealously guarded\u2019 exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d Byrd, 178 Wn.2d at 623 (emphasis added) (citing Bravo Ortega, 177 Wn.2d at 122). Thus, we have explained that under article I, section 7 (as opposed to the Fourth Amendment), \u201cwhen a search can be delayed to obtain a warrant without running afoul of [officer safety and evidence preservation] concerns ..., the warrant must be obtained.\u201d State v. Valdez, 167 Wn.2d 761, 777, 224 P.3d 751 (2009) (emphasis added). Because exigencies are presumed in a search incident to arrest, the exception already amounts to a departure from this court\u2019s general disapproval of searches lacking individualized suspicion. Nevertheless, this court\u2019s recent cases on the exception have eschewed any conceivable limiting principle.\n\u00b637 The second principle is that a warrantless search incident to arrest is permissible under Robinson only where \u201c \u2018the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual\u2019s privacy [is outweighed by] . . . the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u2019 \u201d Riley, 134 S. Ct. at 2484 (emphasis added) (quoting Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U.S. 295, 300, 119 S. Ct. 1297, 143 L. Ed. 2d 408 (1999)). As the United States Supreme Court recently explained, \u201c[This] balancing of interests supported the [limited] search incident to arrest exception in Robinson\u201d id., but \u201c[n]ot every search \u2018is acceptable solely because a person is in custody,\u2019 \u201d id. at 2488 (quoting Maryland v. King,_U.S._, 133 S. Ct. 1958, 1979, 186 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2013)). Instead, \u201cwhen \u2018privacy-related concerns are weighty enough\u2019 a \u2018search may require a warrant, notwithstanding the diminished expectations of privacy of the arrestee.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting King, 133 S. Ct. at 1979). In today\u2019s holding, the majority declines to perform any balancing at all, opting instead for \u201ca mechanical application of Robinson\u201d id. at 2484. It thereby avoids the question of whether there was any possibility, during either search, that Brock could have accessed the backpack. When there is no such possibility, and where there is no showing that transporting the bag poses any risk to officer safety, the search does not serve any \u201c \u2018legitimate governmental interests,\u2019 \u201d id. (quoting Houghton, 526 U.S. at 300), and the balance tips in favor of privacy.\n\u00b638 In this case, the arresting officer did not articulate any safety or evidence preservation concerns to justify either search of Brock\u2019s backpack. Clerk\u2019s Papers at 63 (trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law) (\u201cthe backpack was not within the defendant\u2019s reach; it was in the control of the officer and the officer articulated neither an officer safety reason for searching the backpack nor an evidence destruction justification for doing so\u201d). Indeed, Officer Olson specifically testified that when he performed the first search of the backpack, Brock was too far away to access it. And when Officer Olson conducted the second search, Brock was confined to \u201ca Plastiglas cage [sic] inside [the officer\u2019s] patrol vehicle.\u201d Verbatim Report of Proceedings (June 14, 2011) at 7. After listening to all the testimony, the trial court concluded that \u201c[t]he officer clearly believed he could search the backpack because the defendant was under arrest, period.\u201d Id. at 10.\n\u00b639 Because the majority embraces this expansive view of the search incident to arrest exception\u2014the view that an officer may search an arrestee\u2019s personal effects \u201cbecause the [arrestee] was under arrest, period\u201d\u2014I respectfully dissent. In keeping with the narrow scope of the search incident to arrest exception, I would construe the phrase \u201cat or immediately preceding the time of arrest,\u201d Byrd, 178 Wn.2d at 623, to encompass only those personal items that the arrestee possessed and controlled between the initiation and conclusion of a full custodial arrest.\n\u00b640 Not all arrests are resolved instantaneously, as in State v. Smith, where a police officer chased after and tackled the defendant before she could arrest him. 119 Wn.2d 675, 677, 835 P.2d 1025 (1992); see State v. Patton, 167 Wn.2d 379, 384-85, 388, 219 P.3d 351 (2009) (finding that the defendant was under arrest from the moment that law enforcement announced their intent to arrest him, even though defendant fled from law enforcement and was therefore not immediately secured in custody). After the officer arrested the defendant in Smith, she collected and searched a fanny pack that had fallen from the defendant\u2019s body during the struggle. 119 Wn.2d at 677. This court reasoned that the defendant \u201cwas in actual physical possession of the fanny pack just prior to the arrest\u201d and held that the pack was therefore validly searched incident to arrest. Id. at 682. Under the rule I would adopt in today\u2019s case, the search of the fanny pack in Smith would be a lawful search incident to arrest because the defendant actually possessed the pack when the arrest was initiated, even though he lost possession while he attempted to evade the arresting officer. Id. All of the searches in the cases cited by the majority would be upheld as proper searches incident to arrest under my proposed rule.\n\u00b641 Rather than adopting this narrow rule, the majority holds that officers may conduct a warrantless search of any item seized from an arrestee during a Terry stop that matures into a full custodial arrest. Majority at 159. In other words, the majority interprets the phrase \u201cat or immediately preceding the time of arrest,\u201d Byrd, 178 Wn.2d at 623, to mean \u201cat or immediately preceding the time of a Terry stop that ripens into an arrest.\u201d In essence, it announces a new exception to the warrant requirement: the search incident to a Terry stop.\n\u00b642 This holding ignores the strict limitations imposed on law enforcement during a Terry stop, confuses the justifications for a Terry frisk with the justifications for a search incident to arrest, and conflicts with our precedent holding that a full custodial arrest is a prerequisite to any search incident to arrest. I fear the majority\u2019s new rule will invite only further expansions of our \u201cnarrow\u201d and \u201c \u2018jealously guarded\u2019 exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d Byrd, 178 Wn.2d at 623 (quoting Bravo Ortega, 177 Wn.2d at 122).\n\u00b643 For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\nThis court has taken the opposite approach in recent cases addressing vehicle searches incident to arrest. See discussion of State v. Valdez, 167 Wn.2d 761, 224 P.3d 751 (2009), infra pp. 165 note 9.\nFor purposes of this analysis, I assume that Brock was under arrest when Officer Olson (1) read him his Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966) warnings but (2) did not place him in handcuffs and (3) told him that he was not necessarily going to jail. See majority at 152. But I note that it is questionable whether this detention actually rose to the level of a full custodial arrest. See State v. Rivard, 131 Wn.2d 63, 76, 929 P.2d 413 (1997) (finding no arrest occurred where defendant was asked to not leave but was \u201cnot physically apprehended, restrained, handcuffed, placed in the police vehicle, [ ]or driven to the police station\u2019\u2019). A custodial arrest is a prerequisite to any search incident to arrest. State v. O\u2019Neill, 148 Wn.2d 564, 585, 62 P.3d 489 (2003) (\u201cprobable cause for a custodial arrest is not enough!;] [t]here must be an actual custodial arrest to provide the \u2018authority of law justifying a warrantless search incident to arrest under article I, section 7\u2019\u2019). Thus, for purposes of the search incident to arrest exception, the earliest possible \u201ctime of arrest\u2019\u2019 in this case was the moment at which Officer Olson read Brock his Miranda rights.\nIn most of its analysis, the majority appears to agree. See majority at 151 (\u201cAfter a period of questioning, the officer arrested Brock and then searched the backpack.\u2019\u2019), 154 (\u201cbecause Brock was separated from his backpack several minutes prior to arrest, the issue involves the scope of \u2018immediately preceding arrest\u2019 \u2019\u2019). But the majority also refers to something it calls \u201c[t]he arrest process\" and asserts that this process \u201cbegan the moment Officer Olson told Brock that although he was not under arrest, he was also not free to leave.\u2019\u2019 Id. at 159 (emphasis added). To the extent that the majority thereby implies that a custodial arrest is not a prerequisite to a search incident to arrest, this is contrary to established precedent. O\u2019Neill, 148 Wn.2d at 586-87.\nSee State v. Jorden, 160 Wn.2d 121, 127, 156 P.3d 893 (2007) (\u201c[T]his court has consistently expressed displeasure with random and suspicionless searches ....\u201d); City of Seattle v. Mesiani, 110 Wn.2d 454, 458 n.1, 755 P.2d 775 (1988) (holding a random sobriety checkpoint program invalid under article I, section 7 because it lacked individualized suspicion).\nThis is particularly troubling in light of the fact that this court has repeatedly cautioned against the incremental expansion of exceptions to the warrant requirement, lest the exceptions \u201cswallow what our constitution enshrines.\u2019\u2019 State v. Day, 161 Wn.2d 889, 894, 168 P.3d 1265 (2007); see, e.g., State v. Tibbles, 169 Wn.2d 364, 372, 236 P.3d 885 (2010); State v. Garvin, 166 Wn.2d 242, 255, 207 P.3d 1266 (2009). In Valdez, this court acknowledged that the search incident to arrest exception has been particularly susceptible to judicial expansion. 167 Wn.2d at 773-74. In the context of a vehicle search, Valdez expressly rejected a justification similar to the one embraced by the majority in this case: that the fact of a custodial arrest itself justifies a search in all cases. Id. at 777 (citing State v. Stroud, 106 Wn.2d 144, 175, 720 P.2d 436 (1986) (Durham, J., concurring)).\nThus, for example, law enforcement must obtain a warrant to search luggage seized incident to arrest when that luggage poses no conceivable danger to officer safety or evidence preservation. Chadwick, 433 U.S. at 15-16; see also Riley, 134 S. Ct. at 2485 (cell phones generally not subject to search incident to arrest since privacy interest in cell phone\u2019s contents outweighs government\u2019s interest in searching phone incident to arrest); Illinois v.

Compare Teny, 392 U.S. at 29 (\u201cThe sole justification of the [Terry] search ... is the protection of the police officers and others nearby . . . .\u201d), with Robinson, 414 U.S. at 234 (\u201cThe justification . . . for the authority to search incident to a lawful arrest rests quite as much on the need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody as it does on the need to preserve evidence on his person for later use at trial.\u201d).\nO'Neill, 148 Wn.2d at 586-87 (custodial arrest is a prerequisite to search incident to arrest even where officer has probable cause to arrest before conducting the search).",

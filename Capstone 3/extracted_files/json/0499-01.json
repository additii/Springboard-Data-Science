        "text": "Smith, J.\nOn April 15,1920, the appellant insurance company issued and delivered to appellee :Smith, as beneficiary, a policy of insurance for one thousand dollars on the life of Smith\u2019s wife. The application for the policy of insurance contained certain answers to questions which, by the recitals of the application, were declared to be material by the company in determining whether or not a policy would issue, and, among others, that the applicant had never suffered from any ailment or disease of the skin. The policy, when issued, contained an incontestable one-year clause reading as follows: \u201cAfter this policy shall be in force for one full year from the date hereof, it shall be incontestable for any-cause except for nonpayment of premiums.\u201d\nThe insured died on March 5, 1921, and on April 13, 1921, the company brought suit in the chancery court to cancel the policy on the ground that its issuance had been procured by the fraud of the insured, in that she had suffered from a disease of the skin, to-wit., pellagra, but had falsely and fraudulently denied that fact in her application.\nIt will be observed that the suit to cancel was brought two days before the expiration of the year after the issuance of the policy, but slightly more than a month after the death of the insured, as the suit on the policy was commenced June 30, 1921.\nThe chancery court transferred the suit to cancel to the circuit court, over the company\u2019s objection, and it was there consolidated with the suit on the policy, to which action the company also objected and excepted.\nAt the trial of the cause conflicting testimony was offered as to whether Mrs. Smith had pellagra, and as to her answers made to the examining physician in regard thereto, but at the conclusion of all the testimony the court directed the jury to return a verdict for the beneficiary, on the ground that a year had expired before the suit thereon was brought. Judgment was rendered accordingly, and the company has appealed.\nInstead of transferring the suit to cancel the policy to the circuit court, that suit should have been dismissed, for the reason that the death of the insured fixed the rights and liabilities of both the insurer and the insured'.

Y., 41 Atl. 970.\nBut, inasmuch as the insured died before the year had expired, the incontestable clause did not apply, and the fact that the suit was not brought until after the first anniversary of the policy is unimportant, for, as we have said, the rights and liabilities of the 'parties under the insurance contract had been fixed by the death of the insured.\nThe court should not therefore have directed a verdict, but should have submitted the question of the alleged breach of the warranty, the law of which question has been announced in many cases.\nFor the error indicated the judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.",

Insurance \u2014 suit to cancel policy after insured\u2019s death. \u2014 A suit brought after insured\u2019s death to cancel the policy for fraudulent representations in the application should have been dismissed, though brought within the contestable period named in the policy, instead of being transferred .to a court of law for consolidation with a subsequent action on the policy begun after the expiration of such period, as the death of insured fixed the rights and liabilities of the parties.\n2. Insurance \u2014 incontestable clause. \u2014 Where insured died within a year after issuance of a policy containing a one-year incontestable clause, the latter clause did not apply, and it was error to direct a verdict upon the ground that the action on the policy was brought after the year had expired.\nAppeal from Greene Circuit Court, First Division; W.

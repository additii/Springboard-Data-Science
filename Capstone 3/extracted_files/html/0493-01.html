Anthony Koss was convicted of first degree burglary. Before jury deliberations, the judge and counsel met in chambers. There is no transcript of the in-chambers proceeding, no reconstructed record, and no agreed summary of what occurred there. Immediately afterward, however, the judge stated in open court that she had given counsel the jury instructions and had made a requested change in one instruction. Koss therefore infers, and the State agrees <em>(e.g., </em>

Koss challenges that procedure for the first time on appeal. As discussed below, recent controlling precedent of this court holds that he can raise this constitutional claim for the first time on appeal and that the trial court must address several factors on the record before closing a proceeding to which the constitutional right to a public trial attaches. But recent precedent also holds that the constitutional right to a public trial does not extend to such a preliminary instructions conference. We adhere to all of those recent controlling precedents.</p>

      <em>to </em>deliberations. In reaching its holding, however, <em>Sublett </em>relies by way of analogy on the rules for discussing jury instructions <em>prior to </em>deliberations. <em>Id. </em>(“we view this as similar in nature to proceedings regarding jury instructions in general”). With regard to such preliminary in-chambers instructions conferences, like the first violation claimed here, we stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.4",542,[245,772,1202,438]]]'>We are aware that, quite often, counsel discuss the instructions with the court during an informal proceeding.

      <em>Id. </em>at 75-76. We then applied that reasoning to the slightly different challenged procedure in <em>Sublett </em>— jury questions asked <em>during </em>deliberations — and concluded that because “[t]he same is true regarding a proceeding to discuss a question from the jury about its instructions,” that latter proceeding did not implicate the constitutional public trial right, either. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 77. Justice Stephens concurred in <em>Sublett </em>for the same reason, stating that “the answer to this question should be the same for a hearing responding to a jury question about the instructions as for a hearing addressing jury instructions in the first instance.” <em>Id. </em>at 141 (Stephens, J, concurring). Her concurrence states that if the public trial right is not offended by holding an in-chambers conference to discuss jury instructions before returning to the courtroom to put matters on the record, then it is not offended when the judge considers a question from a deliberating jury with counsel in chambers before entering the matter in the record. <em>Id.</em>

It lacks any indication that the judge consulted with counsel regarding the jury questions either privately or publicly. It also lacks any indication that she did not do so. The report of proceedings shows only that the jury exited, that a short discussion occurred in the courtroom irrelevant to the issue before us, and that the jury returned with its verdict. 2 VRP (Apr. 29, 2009) at 346-47. The trial minutes show only that the defense rested its case at 10:37 a.m. and the jury returned with its verdict at 2:35 p.m. CP at 71. Neither party reconstructed the relevant portions of the record, as is permitted under RAP 9.3 (permitting the party seeking review to prepare a narrative report of proceedings), RAP 9.4 (permitting the parties to prepare an agreed-upon report of proceedings), RAP 9.9 (permitting the parties to correct or supplement the report of proceedings before transmittal to the appellate court), and RAP 9.10 (permitting such correction of the record even after transmittal to the appellate court).

    <blockquote id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[241,599,1210,575]]]'>Does the [logic and experience test] permit chambers consideration of all questions from a deliberating jury, such as questions about evidence, or is it limited to questions about the court’s instructions? What analytical path is to be used for a different sort of question? What if the court and counsel all have new trials underway and cannot be physically present where the jury is deliberating — can they resolve the issue on the telephone, which has been a frequent practice? By email? What about consideration of questions from the jury during trial? If jurors are permitted to submit proposed questions for witnesses, may counsel and the court confer in chambers to decide which questions should be asked?</blockquote>

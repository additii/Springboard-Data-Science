Tate named as beneficiary. All premiums due on the policy had been paid, and on August 4, 1931, the insured was killed in an automobile accident, while the policy of insurance was apparently in full force and effect.</p>

All these questions were answered by the applicant in the negative.</p>

The by-laws provided that no benefit certificate should be issued to any applicant until examined by the camp physician. The application was divided into three parts, part one dealing with the family history, and at the top of the page it is provided that it may be filled in by the applicant or deputy, part two dealing with the health and medical history of the applicant must be filled out by the camp physician, and part three was the medical certificate, it being made by the examining physician, the camp physician, Dr. C. P. Burnett of Paducah, Ky.</p>

On August 4, Mrs. Tate was killed in an automobile accident while riding with her husband near Monteagle, Tenn. Mrs. Fields thereupon sent Mr. Tate word about the certificate, which she had, and he reimbursed her to the extent of $6.50, which was paid after Mrs. Tate’s death. The total amount of $7.75 was tendered to appellee in settlement of the policy before suit was brought.</p>

Shemwell, G-oodloe and Fishman; that a copy of the hospital record is attached and may be admitted in evidence; that the history as given thereon was based on facts given by the deceased, Alice Tate, and on her examination .by physicians ; that the application for the insurance was made May 6, 1931, and may be admitted in evidence; that Dr. <a id="p1141" href="#p1141" data-label="1141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1141</a>C.

Burnett was the camp physician and conducted the medical examination as shown on page 3, and prior to said examination he did not know of the operation, and that, if present, he would testify that he did not know that the operation had been performed on Mrs. Tate; that he asked her various questions appearing on the application, page 2, and the answers were put down as she gave them. ‘ She stated to me that she had not had an operation and had not been an inmate of a hospital. Had I known of the operation which she had on December 12, 1930, and had I been familiar with the hospital records which I have since examined, after the death of Mrs. Tate, showing carcinoma and that there had been a hysterecotomy and removal of the uterus, I would not have recommended her. I did not observe anything in the examination that caused me to believe that she had had an operation. I considered the statements she made as true’.”</p>

She did not write down the doctor’s examination; he made his own examination, <a id="p1142" href="#p1142" data-label="1142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1142</a>and bad received no information from ber or anybody else that sbe bad bad an operation.”</p>

    <p id="b1162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1162.6",1162,[291,969,1201,663]]]'>It is insisted that tbe court erred in not directing a verdict in appellant’s favor, and this contention must be. sustained. Tbe undisputed testimony discloses that tbe insured in ber application made answers to several questions about never having been operated upon nor an inmate of a hospital, and, under the provisions of tbe application, tbe policy or contract of insurance and by-laws such untrue representations and warranties voided tbe policy according- to its provisions. Tbe fact that tbe untrue warranties bad nothing to do with tbe accident or injury makes no difference, since tbe policy would not have been issued if tbe true disclosures bad been made to tbe questions asked, and it was not done.</p>

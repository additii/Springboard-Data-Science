Under MUCA, a collective garden exists when individuals “participate in collective gardens for the purpose of <em>producing, processing, </em>transporting, and delivering cannabis for medical use.” RCW 69.51A.085(1) (emphasis added). Thus, because RCW 69.51A.140(1) authorizes a city to enact zoning requirements pertaining to the “production” and the “processing” of medical marijuana, and because collective gardens are defined to include “producing” and “processing” medical marijuana, the statutory context strongly confirms that a city’s power under RCW 69.51A.140(1) is not limited to commercial or licensed producers but also includes noncommercial collective gardens. <em>State v.

Because the legislature ensured that cities have the power to adopt “zoning requirements” — but did not grant carte blanche to opt out of all medical marijuana activity — a city’s ordinance under RCW 69.51A. 140(1) must concern a land use. Here, the Ordinance does concern a land use. It adopts zoning requirements for “the growing, production, processing, transportation, and delivery of cannabis” in a collective garden, if seven conditions defining a collective garden are satisfied.

The Court of Appeals’ analysis is flawed because it overlooks that the Ordinance not only prohibits participation in collective gardens, it also eliminates a state law right to assert an affirmative defense in relation to participation in collective gardens.

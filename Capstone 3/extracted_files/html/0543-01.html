The trial court placed the burden on respondent Mr. Blayne Coley to prove his incompetence. The Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that the burden rests with the State to prove restoration of competency and that the trial court’s mistake created structural error. We reverse the Court of Appeals and hold that the relevant statute— interpreted by its language, the context of the provision, the statutory scheme as a whole, and related provisions— places the burden on the party contesting competency where, after an evaluation ordered under RCW 10.77.060, the individual has been evaluated as competent. We also hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to rule on Mr. Coley’s requests to proceed pro se pending a competency determination, and that Mr. Coley’s request after he was deemed competent to stand trial, and therefore eligible for self-representation, was equivocal.

Defense counsel filed a motion requesting an evaluation of Mr. Coley’s mental condition in July 2008. After referring Mr. Coley to Eastern State Hospital for evaluation and treatment, the court on December 9, 2008, entered an order of competency based on the hospital’s uncontested report. The court moved forward with pretrial preparations until, during an April 20,2009, hearing regarding Mr. Coley’s request to proceed pro se, Judge Evan Sperline again became concerned with Mr. Coley’s competency. Judge Sperline referred Mr. Coley to Eastern State Hospital for another competency evaluation. After receiving a report from Dr. William Grant at Eastern State Hospital that Mr. Coley was incompetent, the court on July 16, 2009, ordered a 90-day stay of proceedings and referred Mr. Coley back to Eastern State Hospital for treatment designed to restore him to competency. The order staying the proceedings and ordering treatment included a finding that “the Defendant, cannot stand trial at this time because he is not competent.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 38 (90 Day Order for Stay of Proceedings for Competency Restoration Treatment); <em>see </em>RCW 10.77.084 (court shall order stay of proceedings pending treatment and restoration period).</p>

After hearing testimony from both doctors and Mr. Coley himself, and considering the doctors’ reports and a recorded interview between Dr. Grant and Mr. Coley, Judge John Antosz determined that Mr. Coley was competent to stand trial. Judge Antosz engaged each of the three witnesses in his own line of questioning in addition to counsel’s typical examination. When he made his competency ruling at the end of the hearing, Judge Antosz cited the value of all of these sources of information and emphasized his own questioning and observation.</p>

He first requested self-representation in February 2009, which the court granted after a thorough colloquy. The court appointed Mr. Coley’s attorney as standby counsel, and Mr. Coley represented himself as pro se counsel for a portion of the pretrial proceedings. In March 2009, however, Mr. Coley requested that his attorney be reinstated and the court granted that request. Then, in April 2009, Mr. Coley again asserted a right to represent himself. The court denied Mr. Coley’s request due to the concerns about his competency that became apparent during his conversation with the judge. CP at 31 (Def.’s Mot. for Pro Se Defense Without Counsel).

The judge advised Mr. Coley against pursuing his right to self-representation, and the two seemed to reach a consensus that Mr. Coley would continue to be represented by his attorney, although the record is not entirely clear.</p>

Mr. Coley responded with an unrelated question about plea bargain procedures. The subject of self-representation did not arise again.</p>

On appeal, Mr. Coley argued that the trial court incorrectly placed the burden on him to prove his incompetence at the June 2010 competency hearing, and that this error constituted a denial of his right to due process guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Additionally, Mr. Coley contended that the trial court’s failure to adequately consider his repeated motions to represent himself without an attorney violated his right to self-representation guaranteed by article I, section 22 of the Washington Constitution. The Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that the trial court misallocated the burden of proof at the competency hearing and this was structural error. Because the Court of Appeals ordered reversal on this ground, it did not reach Mr. Coley’s argument regarding self-representation. The State petitioned for review.</p>

The scheme is intended to ensure the defendant’s competency, whenever questioned, so he may be tried, but it recognizes the defendant’s interest in being free from involuntary mental health commitment and treatment.

Dissent at 563. The dissent’s concern overlooks the competency scheme in chapter 10.77 RCW. First, the trial judge did not issue an “order finding the defendant incom<a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>petent,” as the dissent asserts. Dissent at 562-63. Following the requirements of the statute, the judge issued an order continuing the trial and committing the defendant for treatment based on its finding that Mr. Coley was incompetent and that treatment could render him competent. Moreover, placing the burden on the party challenging competency does not treat the judge’s order “like it does not exist.” Dissent at 563. To the contrary, the judge’s order retains all the “force” that the legislature intended — the order stopped the proceeding and referred the defendant for treatment. The subsequent competency hearing is not designed to address new competency concerns but rather to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment ordered by the court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

At oral argument, the State took the same position. It represented that it had canvassed the practice of prosecutors across Washington, weighed the competing interests at stake, and — considering that history and practice — it was taking the same position as the defense on this particular point. Specifically, the State argued that at a hearing to determine whether a defendant, who was declared incompetent by the most recent court order, has been restored to competency, the State — the party challenging the previously entered order <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>finding the defendant incompetent — bears the burden of proving competency by a preponderance.</p>
    <p id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[147,468,1257,804]]]'>¶45 I agree with both parties on this point. I think the statutes at issue here are most properly interpreted as placing the burden of proof on the party challenging the status quo. At the start of the trial, the status quo is usually the default presumption that a defendant is competent. <em>See In re Pers. Restraint of Rhome, </em><a href="/wash-2d/172/0654-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="172 Wash. 2d 654" data-case-ids="4018588" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/172/0654-01">172 Wn.2d 654</a>, 663 n.2, <a href="/citations/?q=260%20P.3d%20874" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="260 P.3d 874">260 P.3d 874</a> (2011) (recognizing “the general presumption of competency to stand trial” (citing <em>State v.

If there is a question about competency and the judge enters an order of competency, the status quo remains a presumption of competency. But where, as here, the judge signs an order stating that the defendant is <em>not </em>competent, then the presumption of competency no longer exists. The trial judge’s actual finding replaces that presumption.</p>
    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.6",627,[141,1295,1256,586]]]'>¶46 Treating the trial judge’s ruling like it does not exist does not make sense and could not have been what the legislature intended. If the trial judge’s finding of incompetency did not remain in force, then that finding would be deprived of all meaning — a party who disagreed with it could just keep coming in and challenging it, day after day, and keep placing the burden on the incompetent defendant to prove continuing incompetency. That seems time-consuming, counterproductive, and disrespectful to the trial judge, who must have given some serious thought to the matter before signing the order.</p>
    <p id="b627-6" data-blocks='[["BL_627.7",627,[141,1903,1254,479]],["BL_628.1",628,[219,341,1252,429]]]'>¶47 I think it is much more reasonable to interpret the statute to place the burden of proof on the party challenging the status quo. In this case, at the beginning of the trial, it was the defendant, Mr. Coley. On Mr. Coley’s motion, the judge referred him to Eastern State Hospital (Eastern) for a competency evaluation. Based on that initial uncontested evaluation, the judge entered an order that Mr. Coley was competent, thus maintaining the status quo. But the judge again became concerned about the defendant’s competency <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>a few months later and ordered another evaluation at Eastern. Based on that second (also uncontested) evaluation, the judge ruled that the defendant lacked competency and signed an order requiring the State to transport the defendant to Eastern for treatment to restore competency. At that point, a new status quo was established by the judge’s decision that the defendant lacked present competency to proceed.</p>
    <p id="b628-4" data-blocks='[["BL_628.5",628,[223,791,1248,424]]]'>¶48 The State then took the steps that the trial court ordered. It sent Mr. Coley to Eastern and provided treatment, and then the State’s expert submitted reports and testified to the court. The State’s expert concluded that Mr. Coley had been restored to competency. But the trial court’s order of incompetency was still in force; only the trial court, not the expert, has the power to make the ultimate legal determination of competency or incompetency.</p>
    <p id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.6",628,[223,1237,1248,747]]]'>¶49 To be sure, the expert’s reports and testimony alone can carry the State’s burden of proving restoration to competency. And that may have happened in this case. It is true that the trial court made some statements at the restoration hearing to the effect that it was placing the burden of proving incompetency on the defendant. But the trial court also made some statements at the restoration hearing suggesting the opposite; it expressly considered the testimony of both the State’s expert and the defense’s expert, as well as the testimony of the defendant (who testified at the competency hearing), before concluding that it believed the State’s expert that the defendant’s competency had been restored.

A trial court’s actual finding of incompetency changes the status quo, and the burden of proof properly rests with the party challenging that status quo — here, the State, not the defendant. Since it is not clear whether the trial court in this case applied the correct burden of proof or <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>not, I would remand for clarification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">4</a> If the trial court did not apply the correct standard of proof, then a reconstructed competency hearing is not appropriate — reversal and remand is required. <em>Drope v.

But the parties and the majority have not treated this case as moot or even raised the issue. And it would not make sense to do so. The trial judge declared a mistrial in October 2010 because a witness revealed inadmissible evidence to the jury, and a new trial was held in December 2010 before the same judge. That mistrial was unrelated to, and thus had no effect on, Mr. Coley’s claim that the trial court erred in allocating the burden of proof at the competency hearing held in June 2010.</p>

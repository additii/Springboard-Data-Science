    <p id="b100-6" data-blocks='[["BL_100.9",100,[202,1340,1246,421]]]'>¶3 Michael Henry, the sole member of SMI, joined with Thomas Hazelrigg to form CP III.

They further agreed that 90 percent of CP III would be owned by individuals and entities controlled by Hazelrigg and 10 percent would be owned by SMI. Aaron Hazelrigg, through nonparty Centurion Management III LLC, was the managing member of CP III.</p>
    <p id="b100-7" data-blocks='[["BL_100.10",100,[201,1780,1247,471]]]'>¶4 To purchase the property, CP III obtained a $70.8 million loan from General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC). The loan was secured by a deed of trust on the property naming GECC as the beneficiary. The deed of trust and two other instruments—the CP III operating agreement and the GECC loan agreement—prohibited the placement of any liens or encumbrances on the property without GECC’s approval. Any unauthorized lien or encumbrance would constitute an event of default.</p>

These claims sought to (1) enjoin foreclosure of the allegedly unauthorized hens and (2) quiet title by voiding the instruments that created them. Plaintiffs later added a sole complaint against Chicago Title; this complaint asserted that Chicago Title was negligent in recording the prohibited hens and that the resulting defaults caused CP III to incur more than $7.5 million in damages, including $3 million in default interest. The claims against all other parties settled, leaving only the negligence claim against Chicago Title. The district court dismissed this claim on summary judgment, finding that Chicago Title did not owe Plaintiffs a duty of care. <em>Centurion Props. III, LLC v. Chi. Title Ins.

We next consider other circumstances that have led us to recognize a professional duty of care. Washington law treats professional duties as discrete duties owed to clients—absent a special relationship, we have extended a professional duty of care to third parties only (1) when the third party is an intended beneficiary, (2) when the third party justifiably relied on a professional’s representations under a theory of negligent misrepresentation, or (3) when a professional is best able to mitigate the risk of a physical injury. <em>See, e.g., Stewart Title Guar.

Because Plaintiffs do not assert a theory of negligent misrepresentation, our analysis considers our rule limiting duties to third parties who are intended beneficiaries and the rationale extending a duty to professionals able to mitigate the risk of physical injury. We conclude by considering the approaches of Arizona and California, the only other states to consider the duty owed by a title insurance company to a third party when recording legal instruments.</p>

This argument for a duty also appears to be entirely predicated on the foreseeability of the harm. However, foreseeability of harm is only one of six factors necessary to determine whether a duty exists. <em>Sterling, </em>178 Wn.2d at 566.

These policy considerations supported the court’s analysis that a duty exists where “the interest in safety is significant” and the engineers occupy a position of control such that their training, education, and experience place them in the best position to prevent harms caused by their work. <em>Id. </em>at 453.

The reason for this rule is clear: if simple negligence were the rule, a party claiming an erroneous but good faith interest in real property would not be entitled to litigate his claim and have an adjudication without fear of being penalized in damages. <em>See, e.g., Ward v. Mid-West &amp; Gulf Co., </em><a href="/citations/?q=1923%20OK%20972" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="1923 OK 972">1923 OK 972</a>, <a href="/okla/97/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="97 Okla. 252" data-case-ids="8886344" data-case-paths="/okla/97/0252-01">97 Okla. 252</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=223%20P.%20170" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="223 P. 170">223 P. 170</a>; <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 773 (Am. Law Inst. 1979) (recognizing privilege to assert claim in good faith). These heightened requirements further the policy of protecting the rights of property owners by encouraging property owners to assert valid property rights while protecting property owners from unlawful claims. Thus, we agree with Chicago Title that recognizing liability for the “negligent recording” of a facially valid instrument would have a chilling effect on recording documents and undermine the goals of RCW 65.08.070. Policy supports our answer of no; to hold otherwise would frustrate Washington’s policy of protecting property rights through the title recording process.</p>

If the hen was not valid, Centrum Financial may have had a claim under its insurance policy. But it is impossible to understand how this action and agreement between Centrum Financial and Chicago Title created a duty to CP III when CP III could not possibly have relied on the commitment or the insurance policy. <em>See ESCA Corp., </em>135 Wn.2d at 832 (accountant did not owe a duty of care to bank absent justifiable reliance on accountant’s draft report in making loan).</p>

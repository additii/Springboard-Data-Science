    <p id="b325-3" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[144,501,1202,864]]]'>The object of statutes of this kind is not to penalize the carrier for refusing to pay olaims within the time required, whether just or unjust, but the design is to bring about a prompt investigation and payment of all proper claims. The penalty is intended to make the. carrier prompt in the discharge of its duties and to allow to the owner of the goods compensation for the trouble and' expense of a suit which the unreasonable delay and refusal of the carrier to pay has- made necessary. In such cases penalties may be made cumulative in order to make it to the interest of the carrier to perform its duty. For instance, section 7525 provides that when a railroad company shall discharge, without cause, any employee, his wages shall become due at once, and, upon the refusal to pay him, a penalty for the nonpaj’ment of such wages shall continue from the date of the discharge at the same rate until paid.</p>
    <p id="b325-4" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[144,1383,1202,404]]]'>The section, however, contains a proviso that such wages shall not continue more than sixty days unless an action therefor shall be commenced within that time. This section has been held constitutional by this court in numerous cases.

Under the present statute there is no limitation to prevent the penalties from becoming excessively cumulative at the will of the owner of the goods. This makes the statute oppressive and unreasonable. It ceases to be a statute for the protection of the public, but becomes one which <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>enables the shipper, by delay in bringing his suit, to force the carrier to pay his claim, however unjust and unreasonable it might be, or, for its refusal to do so, to pay a penalty which, by the action of the owner of the goods and not the carrier, had been allowed to continue until it became wholly disproportionate to the loss suffered. In other words, the statute gives the option to the shipper to make the penalty cumulative and to become oppressive. Therefore, the cumulative penalties provided by the statute are unreasonable, and by the act of the owner may become so excessive as to prevent the carrier from resorting to the courts to contest the correctness of the claim. The penalty clause of the statute is unconstitutional in that it denies to the carrier the equal protection of the law and deprives it of its property without due process of law.</p>

Collection agencies that fall within the first category of entities — entities that solicit claims for collection — need not collect claims owed to another. Accordingly, we reject defendants’ argument that debt buyers cannot be collection agencies simply because they collect claims they purchase and own, and we hold that debt buyers qualify as collection agencies under the WCAA as long as they solicit claims for collection.</p>

In other words, soliciting claims for collection involves conduct aimed at procuring a claim for collection. A passive market participant does not “solicit” claims for collection. There must be some affirmative act on the part of the solicitor. For example, the solicitor could advertise that it is purchasing claims, target individual sellers, enter into contracts with sellers to purchase claims, or perform market-based research to generate lists used to purchase claims. <em>See, e.g., </em>RCW 19.182.010(7) (“direct solicitation” means “the process in which the consumer reporting agency compiles or edits for a client a list of consumers who meet specific criteria and provides this list to the client or third party on behalf of the client for use in soliciting those consumers for an offer of a product or service”). By contrast, if a company is formed, sits idle, and <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>never actually solicits or acquires any claims for collection, that company has not solicited claims for collection.

It is not our task to make factual findings, only to explain Washington law. Thus, we hold that Midland Funding, a debt buyer, is a “collection agency” under RCW 19.16.100(2) if the district court finds that Midland Funding solicited claims for collection — that is, if Midland Funding or its agents took any affirmative steps to obtain claims for collection.</p>

In addition, Midland Funding solicits claims “for collection” even if it outsources the collection as long as its purpose for soliciting the claim is collection. None of the statutory exemptions applies to persons who outsource collection. <em>See </em>former RCW 19.16-.100(3)(a)-(f). In sum, debt buyers like Midland Funding fall within the statutory definition of “collection agency” if they solicit claims for collection.

There has been no judicial guidance on the issue; no court has addressed whether debt buyers were included in the statutory definition.

      <p id="b380-9" data-blocks='[["BL_380.9",380,[210,1632,1247,746]]]'> “Solicit” clearly requires some affirmative conduct, but the statute’s ambiguity arises because parties disputed whether the statute applied to debt buyers who were soliciting/collecting claims they owned, as opposed to third party claims. Indeed, the Collection Agency Board (Board) — the agency charged with administering the WCAA — struggled to determine whether debt buyers fall under the statutory definition due to this ambiguity. <em>See </em>RCW 19.16.410. In a July 2004 meeting, the Board adopted an interpretation that debt buyers who collect solely on their own claims <em>and </em>in their own names are not covered by chapter 19.16 RCW. But in a more recent October 2011 board meeting, the Board acknowledged its 2004 decision and asked an assistant attorney general to reexamine whether debt buyers fall under the definition of a “collection agency” in RCW 19.16.100(2). The assistant attorney general offered no answer but suggested that debt buyers should fall under the department’s regulatory oversight responsibilities. Finally, during a September 2012 meeting, the Board unanimously passed a resolution that the Board should “continue to review the issues” and “that the Board’s current and past minutes are not intended for use as persuasive authority on those issues.” Thus, the enforcing agency struggled to determine whether debt buyers fell within the scope of the definition, ultimately deciding that further research was necessary. This supports the conclusion that the statutory language is ambiguous.</p>

It strains credulity to suggest that Midland Funding acquired 7,278 claims for collection without ever undertaking any steps to solicit claims. In addition, defendant Encore Capital files reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Defendants Midland Funding and MCM’s financial and operational information are not separately required but, rather, are subsumed in the disclosures made by Encore Capital to the SEC.

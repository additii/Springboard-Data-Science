The land was described so that the court could, with the aid of extrinsic evidence, apply the description to the exact property intended to be sold. Looking at the letters, it must be assumed that both parties were dealing as to a particular 80-acre tract of land near Beebe owned by Jennie Exelby. The letters which constitute the contract identify and furnish the means of finding the land. The letters refer to a particular 80-acre tract of timber land still owned by Jennie Exelby near Beebe. It is inferable from the letters that this was the only tract of land in that vicinity which she still owned. Hence an ambiguity could not exist unless she could show that she had more than one tract of land in the vicinity of Beebe.</p>
    <p id="b931-3" data-blocks='[["BL_931.4",931,[213,1247,1199,509]]]'>It is not like a case where 80 acres of land are described. In such case it would be necessary for the plaintiff to show that the defendant had only one tract of land, and this would be supplying and adding to a description insufficient on its face. Where a party agrees to sell a particular 80 acres of land which is described as all the land owned by him situated near a certain town, extrinsic evidence may be used for the purpose of identifying the land and applying the description to the particular eighty.</p>

It is true that the date of the deferred payment is made on November 1, 1925, instead of October 1, 1925, as in, the original contract, but this was due, no doubt, to the fact that Moore had not kept a copy of the original letters or that he did not have them before him-when he wrote the letter restating the terms of the contract. Besides, if the contract had become a valid and binding one by a definite offer and acceptance by both contracting- parties, it could not be abrogated by one of the parties mistaking i'ts terms or proposing new ones.</p>

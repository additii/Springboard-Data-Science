The finding of the council shall be expressed in an ordinance in case it is in favor of the petitioners, and in that event the territory sought to be annexed shall become a part of the improvement district, and the improvements petitioned for shall be made by the commissioners. The commissioners shall' make the assessment for said improvement on the territory annexed, under the provisions of this act, on the same basis as if said territory was included in the original district.

    <p id="b601-3" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[154,524,1208,1750]]]'>It will be observed that the act provides as follows: “The commissioners shall make the assessment for said improvement on the territory annexed under the provisions of this act on the same basis as if said territory was included in the original district.” This language clearly evinces the intention of the Legislature to allow the city or town council the power to annex territory to any improvement district in a city or town when the provisions of § 5733, <em>supra, </em>are complied with. When this is done, the annexed territory becomes a part of the original improvement district to which it is annexed, and the commissioners of the district are to proceed in making the improvements contemplated in the annexed territory just as they would in making; the original improvement. When the annexation ordinance is passed, then the board of commissioners of the district, which now embraces the original and the annexed territory, shall proceed to form the plans for the improvement to be made in the annexed territory, as prayed in the petition of the property owners in such territory, and proceed in like manner to make the improvement in the annexed territory as they did in making the improvement constituting the original district. In other words, when the territory is annexed under the provisions of act No. 280 (5733, <em>supra), </em>then the improvements in the annexed territory are to be made by the commissioners of the district according to the provisions relating to municipal improvement districts as* contained in §§ 5656-5701 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest. These provisions meet all the objections enumerated in the complaint, and urged by learned counsel for the appellant in their brief to the statute under review, as not constituting due process. They afford ampie protection to the property owners of the annexed territory.</p>

    <p id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[288,1205,1201,1013]]]'>The appellant contends that, under the doctrine of these cases, the act under review is likewise void. But not so, because this act does make provision for the assessment of benefits in the annexed territory, under the same provisions of law as are applicable to the territory in the original district. The act contemplates that the commissioners, after the territory is annexed, shall cause the assessors of the district to make the assessment for the improvement of the territory annexed on the same basis as the original territory was assessed. This act does not have the effect of creating a new district, but only annexes territory to the original district and makes such territory, when so amiexed, a part of the original district, and provides for the assessment of 'benefits in the annexed territory according to the provisions of the law applicable to the territory in the original district. Where such is the case, it cannot be said that no provision is made for the assessment of benefits in the territory annexed. <em>McCord </em>v. <em>Welch, </em><a href="/citations/?q=147%20Ark.%20363" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="147 Ark. 363">147 Ark. 363</a>.</p>

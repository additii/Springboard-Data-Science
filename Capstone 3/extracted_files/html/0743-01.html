It is the contention of Meriwether that the contract, properly interpreted, rendered him liable only for an overriding royalty for gravel mined and shipped from certain leases which had been procured for him by DuBose, and that this royalty had been paid, but that large quantities of gravel had been shipped from other leases, and that as to this DuBose was not entitled to a royalty under his contract.</p>

S. Meriwether, who then directed him, to take all future leases in the name of the <a id="p746" href="#p746" data-label="746" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*746</a>Meriwether Sand &amp; G-ravel Company, a corporation, of which J.

Meriwether was president, and the then owner of one-half of its capital stock; that at the time Meri-wether entered into the contract with DuBose he had in contemplation the organization of the said corporation for the purpose of mining- and shipping sand and gravel from all leases taken in and around Lewisville, and that said company was organized for that definite purpose; that a short time after the organization of the company J. S. Meriwether became the owner of practically all of the capital stock of the corporation. The court further found that the corporation, with full knowledge of the contract, accepted an assignment of all the leases taken by DuBose in the name of J. S. Meriwether, and a large number of leases taken by said DuBose in the name of the company at the direction of J. S. Meriwether, after the incorporation of the said company; that the corporation made payments to DuBose for royalties on gravel taken from leases taken in the name of J. S. Meriwether, and those taken direct to the Meriwether Sand &amp; G-ravel Company; that the company received and accepted the benefits of the contract with full knowledge thereof; that the total yardage shipped from the time operations began until December 16, 1930, was 549,941.69 cubic yards, and that the defendants were jointly liable to the plaintiff for two cents on each cubic yard of which amount the sum of $1,246.10 had been paid.</p>

Without setting out the complaint in detail, it suffices to say there were allegations to justify the prayer for an accounting. That this was obviated by stipulation of counsel during the trial of the case would not defeat the jurisdiction of the court. There was also the allegation that the company was in-<a id="p747" href="#p747" data-label="747" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*747</a>eorporated for the purpose of carrying out the contract and to mine the leases procured by the plaintiff, and that, with full knowledge of the contract, the company received the benefits thereunder.

    <p id="b767-5" data-blocks='[["BL_767.5",767,[205,854,1201,502]]]'>The next assignment of error is the action of the court in denying the motion to make the complaint more definite and certain. The court did not err in its ruling, for it was apparent that the information sought to be elicited was not available to the plaintiff, but was in the possession of the defendants. Neither did the court err in overruling the renewed motion for transfer to the law court at the conclusion of the evidence, for the evidence accepted by the chancellor tended to establish the facts as alleged.</p>

It was fully established by the testimony that DuBose resided in Lewisville and was well acquainted with the landowners in that vicinity. He had discovered that there was a quantity of sand and gravel in that locality, and had conducted frequent exploratory operations to determine its quality and quantity. Believing that his find was valuable and learning that Meriwether was familiar with the value of deposits of sand and gravel and engaged in the business of mining such, he conveyed to the said Meriwether the information he had gained and of Ms acquaintance with those who owned the lands upon which sand and gravel had been discovered. Meriwether sent an agent with DuBose to go over the prospects, and, being convinced of the value of the find, entered into the contract with DuBose, which was prepared in Shreveport, Louisiana, by the attorney of J. S. Meriwether. At the time of the execution of the contract no leases had <a id="p748" href="#p748" data-label="748" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*748</a>been actually procured, but, after it was signed by the parties, DuBose began to secure leases which were taken in the name of J. S. Meriwether, and provided for the payment to the landowner of eight cents per cubic yard for sand and gravel. Within a short time after the contract was executed, Meriwether formed the Meriwether Sand &amp; Gravel Company for the purpose of mining the sand and gravel around Lewisville, and assigned to it said leases. He was president of the company, and, at the time of the .incorporation, the owner of fifty per cent, of the capital stock, and a short time thereafter purchased practically all of it. He was the owner of the company during the time it was engaged in developing the leases and shipping the product.</p>
    <p id="b768-5" data-blocks='[["BL_768.5",768,[285,1112,1203,604]]]'>Without setting out the testimony at length, we deem it sufficient to say that there was testimony tending to sustain the finding of the court that Meriwether directed DuBose to take leases direct to the Meriwether Sand &amp; Gravel Company, and that a number of such leases were procured either entirely by DuBose’s efforts or with his aid, and that the company was called into being for the definite purpose of conducting the mining operations and made payments of the overriding royalties on leases taken in the name of J. S. Meriwether originally and assigned to the Sand &amp; Gravel Company, and also on leases taken directly in the first instance to the company.</p>
    <p id="b768-6" data-blocks='[["BL_768.6",768,[285,1723,1199,250]]]'>In view of the plain language of the operative part of the contract, the dealings between the parties with reference thereto, and the fact that the contract was written by Meriwether’s attorney, we think the construction placed on it by the chancellor is justified.</p>

Therefore, the corporation may <a id="p749" href="#p749" data-label="749" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*749</a>be said to have adopted sueb contract as its own, and is liable to tbe same extent as J.

He further alleged that, since discovering the fact of repudiation of these witnesses of their former testimony, the State had not had time to ascertain the whereabouts of other witnesses who knew and would testify to substantially the same state of facts. He further alleged “that by reason of the fact that the homicide charged against the defendants was committed three and a half years ago, witnesses whom the State desires to have subpoenaed have become scattered over the State of Arkansas and in many other States, and that the State has not had sufficient time, by reason of said facts, to have the necessary witnesses brought to this court; that it will be impossible, or practically so, to locate the <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>present whereabouts of these witnesses, who are now living in various communities over the State, and to have them served with process sooner than the next regular fall term of this court; that the testimony of these witnesses is material, and that the State cannot be ready for trial at the present term of this court.”</p>

The motion was granted, and the cases were set for the second Friday. On the second Friday the court was engaged in the trial of State <em>v. </em>Coth-ran, on trial for murder. The purpose of adjourning the Lee Circuit Court until December 11, 1922, was to try these defendants. Mr. Burk Mann was present as their attorney, and filed the motion and discussed the cases with the court. He said that he had not collected his fee and that on that account he consented in open court to the adjournment until December 11 for the purpose of trying these cases. The Phillips Circuit Court meets after the adjournment of, the Lee Circuit Court, and the Phillips Circuit Court was in session at Helena on December 11. That is the reason the adjourned term of the Lee Circuit Court was not held. After the jury in the Cothran case was impaneled, witness excused the remainder of the jury for the term. The cases against the defendants were not, tried at the regular October term, for the reason that witness and the attorney representing the defendants had agreed on a special term of the Lee Circuit Court for December 11, 1922, to try them, and for the further reason that there was not sufficient time to try them. There was a full week of the Lee Circuit Court after the trial of the Cothran case. Witness was asked this question: i£Q. Then it was not for the lack of time that they were not tried? A. Yes, it was. Q. Couldn’t it have been tried? A. Not with Mr. Smith and you and the other attorneys in this case examining the jurors. I don’t think, if you had had a full week, you could have started. Q. You had a full week after Saturday to try them? A. Oh, possibly we could have tried one — maybe two. ’ ’ The agreement to a continuance of the case was in open court.</p>

The overruling of their motion would have the effect not only of depriving them of their liberty, to which they were entitled immediately from the time the motion was overruled, but also of subjecting them to the humiliation, annoyance and expense of a trial on the indictments. The 'statute, if mandatory, was intended to guarantee persons entitled to its provisions their liberty at the end of the second term of the court having jurisdiction of the offense after the finding of the indictment. They are entitled to their liberty at once at the end of such term. If the facts existed which entitled appellants to their discharge under the statute, then the effect of the court’s order was not only to deprive them of the boon of liberty, but to subject them to all the consequences of a trial, or else to resort to some other remedy to prevent it. It is unnecessary here for us to determine whether appellants could have secured their liberty by habeas corpus or whether they could have prevented the trial court from proceeding against them by prohibition. Suffice it to say, they had the right to move the court having jurisdiction of these causes to discharge them from the indictments; and, if they are entitled to such discharge, the granting of their motion by the court would have given them their rights under the statute, -whereas the overruling of their motion denied them such rights. No order or judgment that any court could have thereafter made would have placed them in the position and given them the rights they were entitled to at the time the order herein appealed from was made by the trial court. That order concluded all the rights they then had under the statute, if any, against them, and this is so even though, after the order overruling their motion, they may have resorted to habeas corpus in the same, or some other court, or to <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>this court for a writ of prohibition.

The next question is, did the court err in overruling apnellants’ motion to be discharged? We are not concerned with the policy of this law. That is for the Legislature. But, as its manifest purpose is to promote dispatch in the administration of justice, it must commend itself to the enlightened judgment of every one who loves law and order as a wise as well a.s humane enactment. “Justice delayed is justice denied,” says Mr. Gladstone. It is highly important to the public weal i that those accused of .crime shall he brought .to a speedy trial in order that, if guilty, public justice may be meted out without delay. This is as powerful a deterrent to the commission of public offenses as is the knowledge that condign punishment will follow when the lawbreaker is overtaken in his crime. It is also humane and just to the accused, who may be innocent, because it imposes upon the ministers of justice the obligation not to unnecessarily delay the trial of the charge which the State has lodged against him, and to afford him an opportunity to prove his innocence before he has been compelled to endure a prolonged punishment by imprisonment beyond the end of the second'term of the court after the term in which he was indicted. These were doubtless the dominant con- <em>\ </em>siderations in the minds of the Legislature when they <em>enacted </em>this statute. It has been a part of our laws ever.1 since the State had an existence. These sections are found in the Revised Statutes and in all our digests. They aré consonant with that provision of our Bill of Rights, art. 2, § 10 of the Constitution, which declares that “in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right ¡ to a speedy and public trial,” and also with art. 2* §- <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>13, which declares that “he ought to obtain justice freely, and without purchase, completely, and without denial, <em>promptly, and without delay, </em>conformably to the laws.”</p>

It would unduly extend this opinion to quote at length from the opinion of the learned Chief Justice in that case, but a careful reading of the opinion will disclose that the court reached the conclusion that, unless the delay to bring the prisoner to trial by the end of the second term, after the term at which he was indicted, was caused through some necessity in the practical administration of the law, the prisoner would he entitled to an absolute discharge without delay; that the prisoner would ■ he entitled to a discharge where the delay of the State in bringing him to trial is for the want of evidence, “because the statute contemplates that, where the application is made and the grounds of it are well founded, the State may have a delay of one term more, if the judge be satisfied that there is material evidence on the part of the State which she has been unable to procure, but may procure by another term.” As we interpret that decision, the prisoner will be entitled to his discharge under the statute for want of prosecution — that is, by reason of a failure on the part of the State to demand trial and produce ;her evidence against the prisoner — unless the delay was for some other reason than simply a failure on the part of the State to demand a trial and bring forward its evidence. It is such want of prosecution on the part of those intrusted with the due administration of the law that this statute condemns by discharging the prisoner upon his application and a showing that the State had failed to prosecute as this statute required.

For the sake of clarity we will briefly restate them here as found by the court. There was sufficient time at the April &gt; term, 1922, to try the causes. There was sufficient time ¡ at the regular October, 1922, term, but not sufficient ; time at the adjourned day of the October, 1922, term, ' because the Phillips Circuit Court was in session on that day. Neither of the defendants, nor any one acting for them, have consented to a continuance of the causes at either the April or the October terms, 1922, nor to the continuance from the regular October term, 1922, to the •adjourned day on December 11, 1922. The court might have found the further facts to be that, even at the time of the application of the appellants for their discharge, the State did not show that there were other witnesses who would give material evidence in its behalf to prove the guilt of the defendants, and that reasonable exertions had been made to secure such evidence and failed, and that there was just ground to believe that such evidence could be had at the next term if the cause were continued to such term. True, in the response to the application for a discharge the State set up that it had not had time to ascertain the whereabouts of other witnesses who knew and would testify to substantially the same state of fasts upon which the defendants had been formerly convicted. These allegations of the response were the <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>merest drag-net. They did not name a single witness, nor set up any facts to which any witness would testify if the cause were continued. They did not designate any- place where a single witness could be found. Taken as a whole, the allegations of the response were but tantamount to saying to the court, ‘‘ There are some witnesses somewhere scattered throughout the State, who, if found, will furnish material evidence for the prosecution, and, if the cause is continued, the State will endeavor to produce them.” These allegations were too vague and indefinite to furnish grounds for the refusal of the application, under the provisions of § 3135, <em>supra. </em>They were •equivalent to no more than a pronouncement and promise upon the part of the State that, if the cause were continued, it would enter upon a search for evidence. But the State had no right at that term to continué' for want of evidence; that right had been lost by failure to ask such continuance at the previous October term, 1922.</p>
    <p id="b584-8" data-blocks='[["BL_584.4",584,[279,1337,1208,509]]]'>The facts found by the court show conclusively that the delay in the prosecution was not on account of the failure of the judge to hold any term of the court, because at the time the regular October, 1922, term was adjourned until December 11, 1922, there was sufficient time of the regular term to try the causes.. Likewise, there had been sufficient time at the previous April, 1922, term to try the causes.

The delay to bring the appellants to trial could not have been caused by the application of the prisoners for continuance. The motions asking the court to set the causes down for trial at both the April and-October, 1922, terms, the testimony, and the findings of the court based thereon, show that the appellants were ready for and demanding trial. It must be held that such was the <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>effect of the findings of the court, and that neither the appellants nor any one acting for them have consented to a continuance. The undisputed facts are that the court, on the day the appellants’ causes were set for trial, was engaged in the trial of another murder ease, which trial was not concluded until the next day, Saturday, and before that trial was ended the judge discharged the regular panel of the petit jury for the term. This conduct of the judge was equivalent to an announcement to the attorneys and all parties in attendance upon the uourt that the court would not hear' any jury trials after the trial then in progress was concluded. If such was not the purpose of the court, and the presiding judge would have tried the appellants’ cases, a sense of justice and fairness should have prompted him to notify appellants’ counsel of that fact. The act of the court shall prejudice no one. Therefore appellants cannot be charged, after this act of the court, with a lack of diligence in demanding a trial, or failure to protest against the court’s action. At any rate, the finding of the trial court on the motion to discharge, to the effect that the appellants were not consenting to a continuance of their cases, is sufficient to show that they had exercised due diligence and were demanding a trial at the regular October term, 1922. This finding of the trial court was based upon the undisputed evidence, because when these prisoners filed their motions asking for a trial they <em>ipso facto </em>put themselves on record as resisting a postponement of the cases. Therefore denial of the application could not have been bottomed on the exceptions contained in § 3132, <em>supra.</em>

The murder case on trial was continued throughout that day and was not finished until some time the following day, which was Saturday. Mann admits that he did not attend the court ■ on Saturday, and it does not appear that any of the other attorneys for the defendants were present. . It was the duty of some of the attorneys for the defendants to have been present or to have been excused by the court. The presiding judge, being well acquainted with all of the attorneys for- the defendants, could look over the court room and see that they were not present, and that they were absent without leave of the court.

The suit was one <em>in rem, </em>as the act creating the district authorized, and appellees intervened and alleged that they were the owners of certain lands therein described, against which the lien for the 1918 drainage taxes was asserted. The pleading was in the nature of a demurrer, and was so treated by the court, and it alleged that no cause of action ivas shown against the lands upon which it was claimed that the 1918 taxes were due and delinquent. The demurrer was sustained, and the cause was dismissed as to appellees’ lands, and this appeal is from that decree.</p>

This is an act entitled: “An act to provide for the filing of a delinquent list of lands, town lots, railroads and tramroads in road and drainage districts, and for the collection of delinquent taxes thereon.” The act requires that lists of delinquent lands be filed with the clerk of the chancery court, and provides that re-demptions may be effected through that officer. Section 4 of the act reads as follows: “When the board of <a id="p990" href="#p990" data-label="990" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*990</a>commissioners, or any one authorized by law <em>to </em>file suit for the collection of such delinquent taxes, desires to commence said suit, they shall obtain a certified copy of said list from the said clerk, which shall be filed with the complaint and taken as a part thereof, and the clerk, for making said list, shall be entitled to ten cents per tract, which shall be taxed as costs in said suit. No suit for the collection of such delinquent taxes shall be brought after three years from date same became delinquent. ’ ’</p>
    <p id="b1008-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.4",1008,[299,879,1199,303]]]'>It appears, from the face of the complaint, that suit was not brought against appellees ’ lands until more than three years had expired since the lands became delinquent for the nonpayment of the taxes sought to be collected, and the cause of action was therefore barred by the statute quoted, if it applies.</p>
    <p id="b1008-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.5",1008,[295,1189,1200,1019]]]'>It is insisted that act 534 applies only to improvement districts created under general statutes, and not to those organized by special acts of the General Assembly, as was the appellant drainage district. There appears to be as much reason for the enactment of a statute of repose in a district created by a special act of the General Assembly as in one organized under the general law, and we find nothing in act 534 which limits its operation to districts of a particular character.

    <blockquote id="b1009-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1009.4",1009,[155,479,1200,509]]]'>“The said special assessment shall be a charge and a lien against all the said property in said subdistrict from the date of the filing of said list of assessments and lands assessed in the office of the recorder of deeds, as hereinbefore provided, and shall be entitled to precedence over all judgments, executions, incumbrances or liens, whensoever created and of whatsoever character, and shall so continue until such special assessment, with any penalty, interest or cost that may accrue thereon, shall be fully paid. ’ ’</blockquote>
    <p id="b1009-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1009.5",1009,[154,999,1200,720]]]'>The subsection quoted must, of course, be read and construed in connection with other portions of the act of which it is a part. The drainage district is divided into five subdistricts. Benefits were separately assessed in each of these districts, and the act authorizes the payment thereof to be extended over a period of time not exceeding twenty-five years after the assessments were made. This special assessment, the payment of which might, under the act, be distributed over a period of years, was made a lien on the property against which it was assessed, which “shall be entitled to precedence over all judgments, * * * and shall so continue until such special assessment, with any penalty, interest or cost that may accrue thereon, shall be fully paid.”</p>
    <p id="b1009-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1009.6",1009,[154,1732,1200,303]]]'>The language just quoted means that this paramount lien shall continue and be enforceable as to each of the annual installments into which the betterment assessment is divided; but the act provides for annual collection of these installments, and suit is authorized to enforce payment of delinquent taxes as delinquencies occur.</p>

It only imposes a limitation as to the time within which the right must be exercised after it has accrued, and this <a id="p992" href="#p992" data-label="992" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*992</a>time is three years. This does not appear to he unreasonable, in view of the priority which the law gives this lien, and if the Legislature may not impose this requirement, as to the time within which suit may he brought after the right to sue accrues, then it must follow that the drainage district could postpone any effort to collect the proportionate part of the installment due in any year until all installments were due and for such length of time thereafter as would be required to bar the proceeding to enforce the collection of the last installment. We do not think the act contemplated such procrastination.</p>

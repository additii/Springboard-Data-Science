The grand jury was selected prior to the date of the alleged crime, and convened for an investigation of such crime at a time when the defendant <a id="p836" href="#p836" data-label="836" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*836</a>was confined in the jail. The grounds of the objection to the panel were (a) that one of the jury commissioners was not qualified as such under the provisions of § 6344 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest. That statute provides that the jury commissioners shall possess “the qualifications prescribed for petit jurymen,” and it is insisted that the particular commissioner did not have these qualifications because of act 135 of the Acts of the General Assembly of 1931, he having served as a member of the regular panel of the petit jury at the March, 1930, term of the court and as a member of the regular grand jury at the March, 1981, term.</p>
    <p id="b856-5" data-blocks='[["BL_856.4",856,[298,996,1205,591]]]'>Act No. 135, <em>supra, </em>provides that “no citizen in this State shall be eligible to serve on either grand or petit jury oftener than one regular term of the circuit' court every two years.” It is not suggested that the commissioner was disqualified otherwise than by the provisions of the act above quoted. That act did not disqualify him from jury service, and he still had all of the qualifications of a petit jury within the meaning of § 6344, <em>supra, </em>but was rendered ineligible for service for a season. Therefore he was eligible to serve as jury commissioner, and the panel could not be challenged because he was one of the number who had selected it.</p>

We think this provision merely directory. The grand jury is an inquisitorial body for the county, and is charged with the duty of investigating all infractions of criminal laws occurring therein. Doubtless the provision above quoted was for the reason that a grand jury drawn from all parts of the county would have within itself a fair degree of information regarding <a id="p837" href="#p837" data-label="837" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*837</a>conditions existing, and, be in a better position to determine the character of the witnesses brought before it, and the reliability of the information which it might receive.</p>

The indictment need not allege the nature of the poisoning, the way in which it affected the victim, or the character of poison used, and the demurrer was properly overruled.</p>

The chemist testified that a slight trace of strychnine was also disclosed by his analysis. The testimony of the two daughters, the oldest of whom was about 17 years of age, and the other about 15, was to the effect that the defendant, their father, had frequently cursed and threatened their mother and at one time, when he was whipping the older of the two with a sash cord, he struck the deceased with it; that on several occasions he had been drunk and threatened to kill his wife “if she came to bed.”</p>

He was macT and threatened to whip her (the witness) because supper had not been prepared; that, after they had partaken of the evening meal, and while her father and mother were in the act of retiring, her mother jumped and screamed and ran out into the yard choking and exclaiming she was dying. Witness was directed by her father to procure a doctor, and, with her sister, left for that purpose. When they returned she found her mother on the bed and her father fanning her. The other daughter stated that both her parents had gone to bed when her mother became sick and jumped up and ran out into the yard and her father choked her mother and bent her backward on the automobile. In this statement she was not corroborated by the older sister. That she and her sister left to get a doctor; that she had heard her father and mother discussing cattle stealing and arson, and had heard her mother object and ask her father not to do it. Neither of the daughters, nor any other member of the family saw the defendant give his wife anything to eat or drink. The younger daughter testified that when her father came home he threatened to kill her mother if she didn’t have supper cooked the next time he came. The older daughter stated that, after the mother’s death, <a id="p839" href="#p839" data-label="839" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*839</a>she prepared some chicleen and dumplings for her father; that he was ordinarily very fond of this, but that he didn’t take any at that time, and that when some of these were taken to the woods as a lunch, they were brought back uneaten, and the younger girl said they turned green.</p>

Also that, in the opinion of one of the deceased’s sisters, the defendant did not appear to grieve much over the death of his wife, and this was one of the things which aroused her suspicion. According to the testimony of the older daughter, her father got up early one morning and built a fire and threw a snuff box in the stove; that he didn’t ordinarily build a fire, and that she got the snuff box and took it to her aunt, who gave it, with other things, to the officers.</p>

It was shown by others that the bichloride of mercury tablets were given to Mrs. Bowie by her brother-in-law. The defendant testified that he did not administer any poison of any kind to his wife, and denied any desire to destroy her. The deceased and the defendant had married when they were quite young. At the time of her death she was about 36 years of age and the mother of seven children by the defendant, and was pregnant with the eighth child, and had had a miscarriage once about eig’hteen months previously. It was shown by a number of witnesses that, during the times she was pregnant, her body would become swollen, especially her face and extremities, and she complained a great deal on account of <a id="p841" href="#p841" data-label="841" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*841</a>her physical infirmities and her lot in life.

    <p id="b861-5" data-blocks='[["BL_861.4",861,[151,558,1214,1815]]]'>The record, as we view it, presents a doubtful question as to the cause of the death of Mrs. Bowie. The circumstances which tend to establish, first, that her death was due to arsenical poisoning, and, second, that if so, the poison was administered by the defendant, are of uncertain value and wholly circumstantial in their character. It is a rule, however, of universal application, that circumstantial evidence is sufficient upon which to base a verdict of guilt, as experience and observed facts frequently establish a connection between proved facts and the fact sought to be proved that is as convincing in its nature as the most positive and direct testimony. Indeed, in many cases where the circumstances are testified to by several unprejudiced witnesses from different sources, the chain of circumstances is less likely to be the result of perjured testimony than even the direct testimony of witnesses, and often is more cogent. This character of evidence, however, has certain disadvantages. A jury has not only to weigh the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, but to draw just conclusions from the circumstances in proof, and in doing so it may, by want of due deliberation, make hasty and false deductions and be swayed in its judgment by prejudice or partiality. This demands that in a case depending upon circumstantial evidence the circumstances relied upon must be so connected and cogent as to show guilt to a moral certainty, and must exclude every other reasonable hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused. Circumstances, however strong they may be, ought never to coerce the mind of the jury to a conclusion of guilt if they can be reconciled with the theory that one other than the defendant has committed the crime, or that no crime has been committed at all. Therefore it becomes important that every fact which might reasonably shed light on the issues investigated should be received and given proper consideration,</p>

      <a id="p842" href="#p842" data-label="842" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*842</a>It will be remembered that Mrs. Bowie died suddenly, and, while her extremities were swollen, and she suffered much discomfort, she had given no evidence of being seriously ill at any short time before her death. The defendant denied any voluntary act upon his part which was the occasion of his wife’s demise, and offered to prove by a number of witnesses that at times she became despondent because of her frequent and manifold ills, and that she had, on numbers of occasions and to different persons, expressed a dissatisfaction with her life and an intention to end it; that she had often said, over a period of six months preceding her death, and to several persons, in effect, “that she had suffered about all a human could and that for very little she would end it all.”</p>

She died suddenly and under circumstances from which it might have been deduced that she had been poisoned with strychnine. The record there; as here, was silent as to the manner in which the poison was given to, or taken by, the deceased. The defendant denied the charge and offered to prove by a number of witnesses, whose affidavits were taken and read on motion for a new trial, that for a long time before her death she had led a life of drunkenness, and while on sprees would announce that she was tired of life and that she had poison enough in her possession to kill a whole family. The court held that these affidavits did not set forth newly discovered evidence, nor were they cumulative or impeaching in character, but embodied the substance of what the defendant offered to prove but which he was not permitted to do by the trial court. It was held that the trial judge erred in refusing to allow the evidence to go to the jury, and the case was reversed and remanded.</p>

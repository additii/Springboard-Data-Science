It purchases vehicles from Honda at wholesale and sells them at retail. From time to time, Honda offers a “dealer cash” incentive program for its dealerships. Under that program, dealerships can earn dealer cash (i.e., a specific amount of extra money) if they sell specific Honda models during specific times and comply with other terms and conditions.</p>
    <p id="b945-5" data-blocks='[["BL_945.9",945,[76,985,1252,1007]]]'>¶2 This case requires us to determine whether Klein Honda’s dealer cash earnings are taxable. We hold that they are. The catchall business and occupation (B&amp;O) tax provision applies to other or additional business activities that do not constitute retail sales. By participating in the dealer cash program, Klein Honda received additional, separate income beyond its ordinary retail sales. That constitutes an additional taxable business activity under the catchall provision. Although dealer cash would not be taxable under one of the Washington State Department of Revenue’s (Department) regulations if it represented a “bona fide discount” on Klein Honda’s wholesale purchase of vehicles, former WAC 458-20-108(1), (5) (1987), dealer cash is not a bona fide discount because Klein Honda does not purchase vehicles from Honda <em>subject to </em>a dealer cash discount. Dealer cash payments are not necessarily quantified or even knowable at the time that Klein Honda purchases vehicles from Honda. Thus, Klein Honda’s dealer cash is taxable.</p>

A “holdback,” for example, is a credit that Honda issues to Klein Honda the month following Klein Honda’s wholesale purchase of a vehicle. Honda provides this holdback credit, along with other similar credits, regardless of whether Klein Honda sells the vehicle — they are an adjustment to Klein Honda’s purchase price of the vehicle. “The ... credits are quantified at or about the time the vehicle is purchased by the dealership and delivered by the manufacturer.” <em>Id. </em>at 20.

When Honda decides to offer a dealer cash incentive program, it sends a marketing bulletin to dealerships informing them what they need to do to earn dealer cash.

First, it held that Klein Honda’s participation in the dealer cash program was a separate business activity subject to the catchall B&amp;O provision. <em>Id. </em>at 353-54. The court reasoned that “[t]he business activity was accepting the offer of American Honda to apply for dealer cash, selling specific models during specific times, documenting those sales as required by the manufacturer, applying to the manufacturer for the dealer cash, and accepting the payment.” <em>Id. </em>at 353. However, in its analysis, the court included language that — when taken out of context — appears to blend the concept of “business activities” with the definition of “gross income of the business,” such that one <a id="p895" href="#p895" data-label="895" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*895</a>could conclude the court held that the B&amp;O tax applies to gross income instead of business activities. <em>See id. </em>at 352.

The court held, however, that Klein Honda’s dealer cash was not a bona fide discount because Klein Honda did not originally purchase the relevant vehicles from Honda subject to dealer cash discounts. <em>Id. </em>at 355. The court reasoned that “dealer cash payments are not automatic upon Klein Honda’s vehicle purchases from . . . Honda.

That is a business activity — it is an “activity] engaged in with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage to the tax<a id="p899" href="#p899" data-label="899" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*899</a>payer or to another person or class, directly or indirectly.” RCW 82.04.140. Klein Honda benefits by earning money from Honda in addition to the money it would ordinarily make from retail sales without the dealer cash program. Honda benefits by staying competitive in the marketplace and having more cars sold by dealerships like Klein Honda. And, as discussed above, the dealer cash program does not constitute a retail sale, so RCW 82.04.290(2)(b)’s requirement that a catchall business activity cannot “constitute a ‘sale at retail’ ” is satisfied. Thus, Klein Honda’s participation in the dealer cash program is taxable under the catchall provision and the Department properly taxed the “gross income” of Klein Honda’s dealer cash at the provision’s 1.5 percent rate. RCW 82.04.290(2)(a).</p>
    <p id="b953-4" data-blocks='[["BL_953.4",953,[70,1134,1252,1062]]]'>¶23 Klein Honda argues its dealer cash is not taxable under the catchall provision because it does not perform “a separate or additional service” apart from selling cars, and it argues that the Court of Appeals’ opinion holding that “the income itself was taxable, with or without an activity, . . . turns the B&amp;O tax from a tax on the privilege of doing business into an income tax,” which is inconsistent with this court’s precedent. Suppl. Br. of Pet’r at 2-3. However, Klein Honda is factually incorrect and mischaracterizes the Court of Appeals’ opinion. Regarding Klein Honda’s business activity argument, although Klein Honda must sell a car to a customer to be eligible for dealer cash, the dealer cash program is a distinct program that provides Klein Honda with income <em>in addition to </em>its income from retail sales through a separate contract with another party (Honda, as opposed to a customer). Klein Honda is not entitled to dealer cash by merely selling a car to a consumer; it must fulfill the terms of Honda’s conditional offer by selling specific cars during specific times and complying with terms and conditions.</p>

In the Court of Appeals’ opinion, it stated that “the <a id="p900" href="#p900" data-label="900" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*900</a>B&amp;O tax is not a tax on only specific enumerated business activities, but rather on ‘the gross revenues received in the course of doing business.’ ” <em>Steven Klein, Inc., </em><a href="/wash-app/184/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="184 Wash.

Klein Honda argues the Court of Appeals’ statement conflicts with this court’s precedent, <em>State ex rel. Stiner v. Yelle, </em><a href="/wash/174/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="174 Wash. 402" data-case-ids="867091" data-case-paths="/wash/174/0402-01">174 Wash. 402</a>, 407, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20P.2d%2091" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="25 P.2d 91">25 P.2d 91</a> (1933), in which this court “upheld the B&amp;O tax because it was a tax on business activity and not income.” Suppl. Br. of Pet’r at 8. Although the Court of Appeals’ reference to the B&amp;O tax as a tax “on” gross income appears imprecise when taken out of context, the Court of Appeals’ opinion, when read as a whole, correctly lays out the B&amp;O tax scheme. The court correctly concluded that Klein Honda’s participation in the dealer cash program “was a discrete business activity’ taxable under the catchall provision. <em>Steven Klein, Inc., </em><a href="/wash-app/184/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="184 Wash.

Under that regulation, “[w]hen a ... sale is made <em>subject to </em>cash or trade discount, the gross proceeds actually derived from the contract and the selling price are determined by the transaction as finally completed.” Former WAC 458-20-108(1) (emphasis added).</p>

Importantly, as the Board found, Klein Honda’s wholesale purchases were <em>subject to </em>the above mentioned credits because “[t]he . . . credits are quantified at or about <a id="p901" href="#p901" data-label="901" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*901</a>the time the vehicle is purchased by the dealership and delivered by the manufacturer” and because every invoice specifically listed amounts for some credits.

Unlike the credits mentioned above, dealer cash payments are not necessarily quantified or even knowable at the time Klein Honda purchases vehicles from Honda, and the invoices for cars do not list amounts for dealer cash savings. Also, Klein Honda is not automatically entitled to dealer cash when it purchases vehicles at wholesale; rather, Klein Honda must earn dealer cash by accepting Honda’s conditional offer and complying with various terms and conditions. Klein Honda could sell a car eligible for dealer cash but not earn dealer cash depending on the timing and the manner in which it sold the car.</p>

As the Board found, “Klein Honda does not account for dealer cash in its accounting records as a reduction in the cost of goods sold.” <em>Id. </em>at 26. Since dealer cash payments are not necessarily quantified or knowable at the time Klein Honda purchases vehicles, Klein Honda does not purchase vehicles from Honda <em>subject to </em>dealer cash savings.

That constitutes an additional taxable business activity. Additionally, dealer cash payments are not bona fide discounts to the wholesale purchase price of vehicles because Klein Honda does not buy vehicles from Honda <em>subject to </em>dealer cash savings.

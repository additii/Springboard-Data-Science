Taxes bad been assessed against these banks, in the time and manner required by law, for the year 1930, which had not been paid before they became delinquent. "When the time for payment had expired, and the taxes had not been paid, the collector of taxes for Boone County filed a motion, in the nature of an intervention, in the chancery court where the assets of the banks were being administered, praying that the Bank Commissioner be required to .pay these taxes out of such assets as he had on hand belonging to the respective banks.</p>

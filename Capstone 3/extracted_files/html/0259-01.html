At the October term, 1921, of the court, the cause was submitted upon the pleadings and testimony, from which the court found that the Bank of Horatio and G-. S. Gilmore had been personally served, and that the First National Bank of Broken Bow had been constructively served; that the assignment of the certificates had been induced through fraud, and for that reason the title thereto had not passed, and that the plaintiff, Zilphie Gilmore, was the owner of them, and ordered the payment of the fund evidenced by the certificates to said plaintiff, upon execution of the bond to the nonresident defendant, the First National Bank of Broken Bow, in the manner provided and for the purpose specified in § 6266 of Crawford <em>&amp; </em>Moses’ Digest. The bond was executed and the money paid to plaintiff in accordance with the decree of the court.</p>

The pleading filed by the appellant denied the material allegations in the complaint of Zilphie Gilmore, and alleged that the assignment of the certificates was voluntary on her part; “that the decree entered October 25, 1921, was void and constituted no authority to the Bank of Horatio to pay this money to plaintiff; that personal service had not been obtained upon this bank; that this court had no jurisdiction over the certificates of deposit, said certificates being outstanding negotiable instruments out of the jurisdiction of this court, the <em>situs </em>thereof being in Oklahoma; that said certificates were not impounded and held under any writ of garnishment or attáehment of this court, and that plaintiff and the First National Bank of Broken Bow were at all times during the progress of this suit residents of Oklahoma.” The prayer was that the judgment be set aside, and that it have judgment over against the Bank of Horatio.</p>

In other words, it contends that the action was strictly <em>in personam, </em>and that the chancery court of Sevier County, Arkansas, had no jurisdiction to render a judgment affecting a fund for which it held certificates of deposit, upon constructive service. We cannot agree with appellant that this proceeding was one strictly <em>in personam. </em>The fund evidenced by the certificates was the real subject of litigation. It was in the Bank of Horatio. In form the certificates are not negotiable. They are assignable under the statute of this State (§ 475 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest), but not in the sense of commercial paper. The purchaser of such certificates only acquires title by assignment, subject to all defenses which might have been made to them in . the hands of the original payee. It is true this suit was against appellant, but it concerned the ownership of a fund not evidenced by negotiable paper in a com<a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>mercial sense, which fund was within the jurisdiction of the court and which had been impounded by ancillary injunction issued out of the court. It was an action <em>quasi in rem, </em>or in the nature of a suit <em>in rem. </em>1 R. C. L., Actions, § 13. For this reason the <em>situs </em>of the action was where the fund was located. It follows that constructive service in respect to ownership and disposition of the particular fund was sufficient to bring appellant, who was a nonresident, and who claimed an interest in the property, into court. While no personal decree could have been rendered against appellant upon constructive service, any decree rendered with respect to the disposition of the property was binding upon it, unless after-wards modified or set aside. The fact that the court rendered a decree ordering the Bank of Horatio to pay the fund to Zilphie Gilmore, before passing upon the motion to quash the service, made no difference. Appellant abandoned the motion by not requesting a ruling thereon before or at the time the cause was submitted. The judgment was not void. The reversal of its former finding and decree by the trial court as to the plaintiff, Zilphie Gilmore, upon the merits, did not automatically work a reversal of the decree ordering the Bank of Horatio to pay the fund to said plaintiff. Appellant obtained a reversal of the cause under § 6266 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, which is as follows:</p>

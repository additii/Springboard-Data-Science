In the absence of a reason to conclude otherwise, we presume juries follow the instructions given by courts. <em>State v. Ervin, </em><a href="/wash-2d/158/0746-01" class="citation" data-index="149" data-cite="158 Wash. 2d 746" data-case-ids="3085831" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/158/0746-01">158 Wn.2d 746</a>, 756, <a href="/citations/?q=147%20P.3d%20567" class="citation" data-index="150" data-cite="147 P.3d 567">147 P.3d 567</a> (2006) (citing <em>State v.

The jury was accurately instructed on the elements of premeditated murder, and it entered a guilty verdict without reaching the felony murder alternative. Applying that presumption, it follows that the jury found the State proved premeditation. Even if the jury had rejected premeditation, a verdict on second degree murder to the exclusion of felony murder would have been inconsistent with the jury’s guilty verdict on burglary. That guilty verdict tells us the jury was not in the position of finding Condon guilty of a murder without committing burglary.</p>

In fact, the jury was instructed on the definitions of “intent” and “premeditation” because both are elements of premeditated murder. RCW 9A.32.030(1)(a). At least one other jurisdiction has found the failure to instruct on a warranted lesser included offense is not harmless where the elements of the charged crime are clearer when they are viewed in contrast with the elements of a lesser included offense. <em>State v. Zolotoff, </em><a href="/or/354/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="155" data-cite="354 Or. 711" data-case-ids="5758637" data-case-paths="/or/354/0711-01">354 Or. 711</a>, 719, <a href="/or/354/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="354 Or. 711" data-case-ids="5758637" data-case-paths="/or/354/0711-01">320 P.3d 561</a> (2014). In other words, the error is not harmless where an instruction on a lesser included offense would disclose a legal distinction that is not otherwise patent and would be helpful to the jury in deciding whether the defendant is guilty of the charged offense. For example, in <em>Zolotoff, </em>the defendant was convicted of possession of a weapon by an inmate and the Oregon Supreme Court found that an instruction on the lesser included offense — attempted possession of a weapon — would have illuminated a nuanced distinction that the alleged weapon was not in fact a weapon if it was only partially made into a weapon. <em><a href="/or/354/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="157" data-cite="354 Or. 711" data-case-ids="5758637" data-case-paths="/or/354/0711-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/or/354/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="157" data-cite="354 Or. 711" data-case-ids="5758637" data-case-paths="/or/354/0711-01">at 719-20</a>. Unlike the scenario in <em>Zolotoff, </em>an instruction on second degree murder would not have provided any additional clarity about the distinction between intent and premeditation.</p>

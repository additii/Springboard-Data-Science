(GHI)) formed Pac Organic Fruit LLC (Pac-O) in 1998. GHI held the majority interest and management responsibilities under the LLC’s operating agreement. Ostenson was required to rent his local Washington storage and packing facility to Pac-O, to run that facility, and to obtain and pay a loan to improve that facility. The business operated from 1998 through 2004 but collapsed in 2005. During 2005, Pac-O defaulted on its operating line of credit and lease payments, Holzman fired Ostenson, and the bank foreclosed on the packing facility. Thereafter, Holzman, acting as Pac-O’s agent, executed a demand promissory note in favor of GHI and transferred Pac-O’s assets to GHI to satisfy the note.</p>

In May 2007, a creditor of Pac-O, Northwest Wholesale Inc., filed the present suit against Pac-O, Ostenson, and GHI, alleging fraudulent conveyance from Pac-O to GHI. In response, Ostenson filed cross claims and/or third party claims against Pac-O, Holzman, GHI, and Total Organic LLC (another Holzman company). Ostenson’s claims against Holzman and his companies (collectively Holzman defendants or HDs) were as a derivative action on behalf of Pac-O.</p>

Thereafter, the only remaining claims were Ostenson’s responsive claims against Pac-O (seven counts) and his derivative claim (count VIII) against HDs. Trial commenced on July 11, 2011. On July 13, after Ostenson rested, HDs moved to dismiss count VIII under CR 41(b)(3). HDs argued that under the WALLCA, (1) a plaintiff asserting a derivative action must be a member of the LLC <em>(see </em>RCW <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>25.15.130(1)(d), .370, .375), (2) when Ostenson filed his bankruptcy petition, he was dissociated as a member of the LLC (and thus had only the rights of an assignee, i.e., right to share in profits, but no management rights) <em>(see </em>RCW 25.15.130(1)(d)(ii), .250(1)-(2)), and (3) as Ostenson had been dissociated from membership in Pac-0 by filing bankruptcy, he lacked authority (standing) to bring a derivative action on behalf of Pac-O. Ostenson answered the motion, arguing that HDs had consented to the derivative action via a stipulation that was previously entered in Ostenson’s bankruptcy proceeding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

HDs presented witnesses over the remainder of that day (July 13) and the next day but did not finish their testimony. The trial court then continued the matter several times. Finally on September 7, 2012, following additional briefing, the trial court granted HDs’ CR 41 motion. In its October 3, 2012 written findings and conclusions, the trial court (1) rejected Ostenson’s contention that HDs had waived their CR 41 motion by putting on evidence, (2) rejected Osten-son’s contention that HDs had consented to the derivative action in the stipulation in Ostenson’s bankruptcy proceeding, and (3) ruled that Ostenson relinquished membership in Pac-0 with his bankruptcy filing.</p>

The trial court denied Ostenson’s motion for reconsideration on January 23, 2013. Ostenson appealed, and Division Three affirmed, holding that HDs did not waive their CR 41 motion to dismiss, HDs did not consent to Ostenson bringing a derivative action, and federal bankruptcy law governing bankruptcy estates and executory contracts did not preempt WALLCA’s dissociation statute. <em>Nw.

Therefore, this case must be viewed in the light of all the evidence.”)- Here, the question in the motion to dismiss did not turn on the sufficiency of the evidence; the salient facts, the dates of Ostenson’s bankruptcy filing and the subsequent filing of his derivative claim, were not in dispute. The motion turned on a legal question—Ostenson’s standing to bring the derivative claim in light of ROW 25.15.130(1)(d) (discussed below). And even if sufficiency of the evidence bore on any pertinent question, nothing indicates that the trial court limited itself to considering only Ostenson’s evidence.</p>

Therein, Finkelstein was a minority partner in two related general partnerships, each of which served as general partners for several limited partnerships. Finkelstein filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 and later converted to chapter 7. Before the bankruptcy filing, each general partnership agreement provided that the partnership would not dissolve or terminate upon the death, incapacity, or bankruptcy of any partner. After Finkelstein filed bankruptcy, each general partnership then amended its partnership agreement to exclude Finkelstein as a partner. Finkelstein then sued the general partnerships for an accounting and breach of fiduciary duties and brought a derivative action on behalf of several of the limited partnerships. The trial court dismissed Finkelstein’s claims on statute of limitations grounds, and Division One affirmed, holding in part that state partnership law was not superseded by federal bankruptcy law, that the partnerships dissolved under state partnership law when Finkelstein’s bankruptcy case was converted to chapter 7, and that as a former partner Finkelstein had no standing to bring breach of fiduciary duty claims or a derivative action on behalf of the limited partnerships. <em>Finkelstein, </em><a href="/wash-app/76/0733-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="76 Wash.

As to the latter issue, we hold that state law defines what the bankruptcy debtor’s interests are and that § 541 brings such interests into the bankruptcy estate, burdened by whatever state law requires. Additionally, if executory contracts are involved, § 365 applies to determine what may be done with such contracts. But here, the express protections of associational rights of nondebtor members found in the WALLCA triggers § 365(e)(2)’s exception, rendering § 365(e)(1)’s prohibition against ipso facto clauses inapplicable.

Purporting to rely on <em>Garrison-Ashburn, </em>the <em>Broadband </em>court held that the state statute <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>in question was an invalid ipso facto provision under § 541(c)(1)(B) and that the debtor’s economic and noneconomic interests in the LLC became property of his bankruptcy estate. <em><a href="/br/498/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="498 B.R. 90" data-case-ids="3651591" data-case-paths="/br/498/0090-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/br/498/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="498 B.R. 90" data-case-ids="3651591" data-case-paths="/br/498/0090-01">at 96-97</a>. However, in <em>In re Williams, </em><a href="/br/455/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="455 B.R. 485" data-case-ids="4184244" data-case-paths="/br/455/0485-01">455 B.R. 485</a> (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2011), another court, applying the same statute and also purporting to apply <em>Garrison-Ashburn, </em>came to the opposite conclusion. The <em>Williams </em>court held that § 541(c)(1) “clearly controls’’ and that the two debtors’ interests vested in their respective estates, but that such interest was determined by the state statute. Thus, as defined by the state statute, a dissociated member retained only economic rights, and since both LLC members had been dissociated through bankruptcy and no one was left to wind up the affairs of the LLC, the court would appoint a liquidating trustee to do so. <em><a href="/br/455/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="455 B.R. 485" data-case-ids="4184244" data-case-paths="/br/455/0485-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/br/455/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="455 B.R. 485" data-case-ids="4184244" data-case-paths="/br/455/0485-01">at 501-02</a>. Such ambiguities support applying a “‘strong presumption’’’ against finding preemption of RCW 25.15-.130(1)(d)’s dissociation provision. <em>Hue, </em>127 Wn.2d at 78 (quoting <em>Progressive, </em>125 Wn.2d at 265).</p>

Then he reasserts in his supplemental brief that § 365(e)(1) does apply while raising two new arguments to avoid § 365(e)(2)’s exception to § 365(e)(1)’s prohibition. In any event, as the Court of Appeals held, it ultimately does not matter whether the Pac-O operating agreement qualifies as an executory contract because, even if it does, under the circumstances of Ostenson’s case § 365(e)(2) would apply to negate the application of § 365(e)(1)’s prohibition, as explained herein.</p>

First, he contends that because his bankruptcy petition was filed under chapter 11 (reorganization), he is a debtor in possession and thus he may be treated as the same entity before and after his bankruptcy filing. Because there will be no assignment of the operating agreement to a different entity, the § 365(e)(2) exception to § 365(e)(1)’s prohibition to ipso facto provisions is not triggered. Second, Ostenson contends that the stipulation entered in his bankruptcy proceeding qualifies as the required consent under § 365(c)(1)(A) and § 365(e)(2) and thus the § 365(e)(2) exception is not triggered. <em>See </em>Pet’rs’ Suppl. Br. at 17-20.

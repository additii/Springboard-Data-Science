Thomas Johnson, one of the Circuit Judges. The President and Directors of the Branch of the Bank of the State of Arkansas at Batesville, sued Black-more, Greer, and Hay, on a note executed to <em>the Branch </em>aforesaid, with no rate of interest specified. Hay craved oyer, which was <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>granted. Green filed a plea in abatement, which the Court struck out, on motion of plaintiffs. This plea was not placed on the record, by bill of exceptions. Defendants saying nothing further, judgment against them for $1000, debt, $288 50, damages, and interest on debt and damages from date of judgment till paid, at ten per cent, per annum. The defendants brought error.</p>

We have already, in a previous case decided at this term, expressed our disapprobation of this striking out pleas, unless the Court perceive they are wholly frivolous. The case now stands simply upon the judgment rendered below. That is given upon a note calling for no particular rate ,of interest upon its face; yet the interest is calculated at ten per cent, per annum, by way of <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>damages, and the same rate of interest allowed upon both debt and damages, until paid. We know of no law that authorizes a party to recover a greater rate of interest than six per cent., unless so expressed upon the face of the contract; and then it cannot exceed ten per cent. The Court, then, in giving judgment for interest on the judgment at the rate of ten per centum per annum, has clearly erred.' It may be proper here to remark, that there is no public corporation in this State, of the name and style adopted by the plaintiffs; but, as there is no proper plea now remaining upon the record, calling in question her right to sue, we are not at liberty to express any opinion, upon that point.</p>

Petitioner Edward Olsen was convicted of a number of crimes, including attempted second degree murder, for an incident of domestic violence against the mother of his children. His offender score at sentencing was six, and he received an exceptional sentence of 360 months. Olsen claims that a foreign conviction for terrorist threats was not comparable to Washington’s felony harassment and should not have been included in his offender score.

Olsen broke into Devenny’s house, poured gasoline on her while she was sleeping, and told her that she was going to die. Police later recovered a lighter near the bed. Olsen has a history of threatening and committing acts of domestic violence against Devenny, including a California conviction for terrorist threats for which he pleaded no contest. During the California incident, Olsen allegedly wrapped duct tape around Devenny’s legs and told her that he was going to kill her, cut her up into little pieces, and put the pieces in a plastic storage container.</p>

All felony counts included domestic violence aggravators for the purposes of RCW 9.94A.535 because the crime occurred in the presence of Devenny and Olsen’s 12-year-old son. A jury convicted Olsen as charged on all counts except attempted first degree murder. Olsen was sentenced using an offender score of six, in part because his California conviction for terrorist threats was found to be comparable to Washington’s felony harassment. The trial court imposed an exceptional sentence of 360 months.</p>

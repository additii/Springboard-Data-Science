He contends that his actions constituted one assault and therefore his two convictions violate double jeopardy. To analyze his claim, we look to how the legislature has defined “assault” and determine whether the legislature intended to punish assault as a course of conduct or upon each individual act. However, the legislature has not provided a definition of assault and the common law definition is ambiguous. Thus, we are guided by the many other jurisdictions that have treated assault as a course of conduct crime, and we are mindful of the “rule of lenity,” which requires us to adopt the interpretation most favorable to the defendant. <em>See State v. Roberts, </em><a href="/wash-2d/117/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="117 Wash. 2d 576" data-case-ids="1373895" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/117/0576-01">117 Wn.2d 576</a>, 586, <a href="/citations/?q=817%20P.2d%20855" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="817 P.2d 855">817 P.2d 855</a> (1991).

Villanueva-Gonzalez entered the room and told her to get out. She did not leave the room, so he pulled her out. After pulling her out of the room, he hit her head with his forehead, breaking her nose in two places and causing her to bleed profusely. He then grabbed her by the neck and held her against some furniture. She was unable to get up while he was holding her, and she said it was hard to breathe because of the blood running down her face and because he was holding her by the neck. In response to a report of a domestic disturbance, the police arrived and arrested Villanueva-Gonzalez. His girlfriend went to the hospital for a CAT (computerized axial tomography) scan and medical treatment.</p>

While Villanueva-Gonzalez is technically correct that he was convicted under two different assault provisions, the <em>Blockburger </em>analysis is not helpful here. The <em>Blockburger </em>analysis is a tool for courts to determine whether two different crimes were based on the same evidence, and it asks whether each statutory provision requires proof of a fact that the other does not. <em>Id. </em>at 633.

Second, the record implies (although does not clearly state) that the actions took place over a short time period, and there is no indication in the record of any interruptions or intervening events. Similarly, there is no evidence that would suggest that he had a different intention or motivation for these actions or that he had an opportunity to reconsider his actions. Based on the evidence in the record before us, we conclude that VillanuevaGonzalez’s actions constituted a single course of conduct. Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals and hold that his two assault convictions violated double jeopardy.</p>

Since the legislature did not define “assault,” we turn to the common law. Given the ambiguous nature of the common law definition of “assault,” we look to other jurisdictions — have largely concluded that assault is a course of conduct crime — and apply the rule of lenity, adopting the rule of interpretation most favorable to the defendant. Treating assault as a course of conduct crime, we affirm the Court of Appeals and hold that Villanueva-Gonzalez’s convictions for assault violated double jeopardy because his actions took place during a single course of conduct.</p>

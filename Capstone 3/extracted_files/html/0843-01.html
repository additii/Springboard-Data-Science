Under the State’s interpretation, virtually any shoplifting offense could fall within the scope of RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b). For example, where a person slips a stolen item into his pocket to hide it from a store’s security camera, the pocket has arguably become a “device designed to overcome security systems.” Similarly, a person who happens to have in her pocket a pair of nail clippers, a Leatherman multitool, or any other tool that people commonly carry with them, at the time she shoplifts would be guilty of retail theft with “extenuating” circumstances. As these practical examples demonstrate, the State’s over-inclusive approach belies the statute’s primary purpose of capturing retail theft that occurs under certain aggravating circumstances.</p>

Br. at 10 (emphasis added). By treating “designed” as synonymous with “used,” the State’s interpretation reads words into the statute that simply are not there. It is beyond our power and function to “ ‘add words or clauses to an unambiguous statute when the legislature has chosen not to include that language.’ ” <em>J.P., </em>149 Wn.2d at 450 (quoting <em>State v. Delgado, </em><a href="/wash-2d/148/0723-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="148 Wash. 2d 723" data-case-ids="609197" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/148/0723-01">148 Wn.2d 723</a>, 727, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20P.3d%20792" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="63 P.3d 792">63 P.3d 792</a> <a id="p852" href="#p852" data-label="852" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*852</a>(2003)). The statute plainly criminalizes <em>possession </em>of certain tools, not actual or intended use. If the legislature had intended to include use within the scope of the statute, it could have done so by including the word “used”—as it did with other criminal statutes dealing with tools, discussed below. The State’s approach is similarly incorrect to the extent that it interprets “designed” to include an intent element. <em>See </em>Resp’t’s Suppl. Br. at 10. Had the legislature wanted to go beyond mere possession and criminalize intent to use a device to overcome a security system, it could have included specific language to that end. As an example, we point to RCW 9A.52.060, also discussed further below, in which the legislature clearly criminalized possession of burglar tools “under circumstances evincing an <em>intent to use” </em>and “knowing that the same is <em>intended to be so </em>used.” RCW 9A.52.060(1) (emphasis added).</p>

Unlike RCW 9A.56.360(1)(b), these statutes explicitly extend beyond an item’s design and mere possession. Under RCW 9A.52.060(2), making or having burglar tools is a gross misdemeanor. Burglar tools include any “implement adapted, designed, or commonly used” to commit burglary. RCW 9A-.52.060(1). Identical language was adopted to define motor vehicle theft tools. RCW 9A.56.063(1). Similarly, a “deadly weapon” under RCW 9A.04.110 includes <em>“any </em>other weapon, device, instrument, article, or substance,... which, under the circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used, or threatened to be used, is readily capable of causing death or substantial bodily harm.” RCW 9A.04.110(6) (emphasis added).</p>

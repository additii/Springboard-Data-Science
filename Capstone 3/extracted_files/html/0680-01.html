With respect to the conviction, he argues that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of reasonable belief that the victim — here, a 12-year-old girl — was at least 14 years old or less than 36 months younger than O’Dell, based on the victim’s declarations as to age.

A.N. testified that she, the friend, and O’Dell made plans to meet up again later that night but that the friend did not join them as planned. <em>Id. </em>at 268-75.

He testified that A.N. wanted to go swimming at the beach, that she left the party with O’Dell to do this, and that the two had consensual sex on the walk to the beach. <em>Id. </em>at 544-48. He also testified that he first learned A.N.’s age when A.N.’s mother called him, the Monday after he had sex with A.N., and told him that her daughter was only 12. <em>Id. </em>at 572-74.</p>
    <p id="b738-5" data-blocks='[["BL_738.5",738,[200,1091,1254,673]]]'>¶6 The State charged O’Dell with second degree rape of a child. With no objection from the State, the trial court instructed the jury that “[i]t is ... a defense to the charge of Rape of a Child in the Second Degree that at the time of the acts the defendant reasonably believed that [A.N.] . . . was at least fourteen years of age, or was less than thirty-six months younger than the defendant based upon declarations as to age by [A.N.].” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 104. While deliberating, the jurors sent a question to the court regarding this instruction: “As to declarations as to age: Must it be verbal or can it be nonverbal?” VRP (Nov. 9, 2012) at 533. Ultimately, the jury was unable to reach a verdict and the court declared a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 542-43.</p>

This time, the State objected. O’Dell argued that A.N.’s statement “I get that a lot” was an assertion that A.N. was older than she looked. VRP (Jan. 18, 2013) at 605-06; CP at 80-81. The trial court rejected that reasoning and denied the requested instruction. VRP (Jan. 18, 2013) at 607-08. The jury convicted O’Dell as charged. CP at 62.</p>

      <a id="p685" href="#p685" data-label="685" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*685</a>¶8 At sentencing, the defense asked the court to impose an exceptional sentence below the standard range because “[t]he defendant’s capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct, or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, was significantly impaired by youth.” CP at 37. The defense argued that when O’Dell committed his offense, he “was still in high school, associating with school age persons” and “was not some mid-twenties man hanging out at the local high school or trolling the internet for young people.” <em>Id. </em>at 40. Counsel also pointed out that “[h]ad the incident happened two weeks prior, and assuming the State could not convince the Court to prosecute [O’Dell] as an adult, he would be facing 15-36 weeks in a well-guarded juvenile detention facility ... rather than 78-102 months in an adult prison.” CP at 39.

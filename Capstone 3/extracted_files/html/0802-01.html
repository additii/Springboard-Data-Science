QTIP is property in a testamentary trust created by a deceased spouse for the benefit of the surviving spouse. The result of the deduction is that “[t]he spouse who dies first controls the final disposition of the property, while allowing the surviving spouse to use the property or receive the income it generates, unreduced by front-end estate taxation.” <em>Bracken, </em>175 Wn.2d at 556. Typically, terminable interests, such as life estates, do not qualify for the marital tax deduction. <em>See id. </em>at 555. However, Congress created an exception for QTIP assets. The effect of the deduction is that the property is ultimately taxed, but the property is not taxed when the first spouse creates the life estate. <em>Id. </em>at 556. The transfer of property is taxed when the second spouse dies and the ultimate beneficiaries become present interest holders. <em>Id.</em>

Sess., ch. 2, § 10 (“[The] act does not affect any final judgment, no longer subject to appeal, <a id="p836" href="#p836" data-label="836" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*836</a>entered by a court of competent jurisdiction before the effective date of this section”). We disagree. The estate arrives at this conclusion by arguing that DOR had no basis in law on which to appeal the order granting summary judgment because DOR appealed the order before the amendments were enacted. This reasoning is unpersuasive.</p>
    <p id="b878-4" data-blocks='[["BL_878.4",878,[205,717,1247,368]]]'>¶[68 Generally, “[w]hen a new law makes clear that it is retroactive, an appellate court must apply that law in reviewing judgments still on appeal that were rendered before the law was enacted, and must alter the outcome accordingly.” <em>Plaut, </em><a href="/us/514/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="182" data-cite="514 U.S. 211" data-case-ids="1339497" data-case-paths="/us/514/0211-01">514 U.S. at 226</a>. Therefore, despite the existence of a “final” trial court ruling, retroactive amendments may apply to cases pending on appeal.</p>

    <p id="b878-6" data-blocks='[["BL_878.6",878,[205,1443,1245,368]]]'>¶70 Here, the trial court entered its order granting summary judgment on April 19, 2013 and DOR filed a notice of appeal on May 16, 2013. The estate of Hambleton did not move under RAP 18.9(c) to dismiss the appeal, and the appeal was still pending when the legislature enacted the 2013 amendment. Therefore, the retroactive amendment applies to the case.</p>

The trial court granted DOR summary judgment well before the <em>Bracken </em>opinion was filed. The case was pending before the Court of Appeals when <em>Bracken </em>became law. And, the case was still pending when the legislature enacted the 2013 amendments. As in <em>Hale, </em>this case was pending before the courts when a decision by our court was released. The legislature retroactively changed the law. And, we apply the change in law to cases pending in the courts.</p>

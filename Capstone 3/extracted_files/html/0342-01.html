The Association, a trade group composed of distributors licensed under RCW 66.24.055, challenges the Board’s decision to exempt distillers who distribute their own manufactured spirits and others acting as distributors pursuant to certificates of approval from contributing to a shortfall of $104.7 million in licensing fees imposed on persons holding spirits distributor licenses.

    <p id="b382-3" data-blocks='[["BL_382.4",382,[212,844,1246,638]]]'>¶2 We reject the Association’s arguments. The plain language of Initiative Measure No. 1183 (Initiative), supported by the context in which the language appears and the overall scheme for licensing participants in the spirits industry, enables the Board to impose the entire shortfall on the spirits distributors without contribution from the distillers. We therefore hold that the Board acted within its authority and did not act arbitrarily or capriciously. Additionally, the Board did not violate the privileges and immunities clause of article I, section 12 of the Washington State Constitution. The decision of the Thurston County Superior Court is affirmed.</p>

The Initiative ended the State’s exclusive rights to distribution and retail sales, allowing private distributors to become licensed to distribute spirits and permitting a limited number of retail stores to sell spirits. The Initiative imposes licensing fees in exchange for the ability to sell and distribute spirits. There are currently four different licenses in Washington that allow the distribution of spirits.</p>

    <p id="b384-3" data-blocks='[["BL_384.4",384,[218,875,1248,890]]]'>¶7 In addition to the basic licensing fees imposed on spirits distributors, distillers distributing their own products, and other certificate holders, RCW 66.24.055(3) created two fees designed to replace the revenue that the State lost when spirits distribution was privatized. <em>See generally Wash.

Subsection (3)(a)(i) imposes a 10 percent<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> fee of all spirits sales by “spirits distributor licensee [s]” (subsection (3)(a) percentage fee). Subsection (3)(c) provides that if the subsection (3)(a) percentage fee did not generate $150 million in the first year under the new statute, the shortfall between the collected fees and $150 million was to be equitably assessed against “all persons holding spirits distributor licenses,” according to rules to be promulgated by the Board (subsection (3)(c) shortfall fee).</p>

WAC 314-23-030. The Board later adopted WAC 314-23-025 to enforce the subsection (3)(c) shortfall fee. Although the Board had imposed the subsection (3)(a) percentage fee on distillers, the Board did not require the distillers to contribute to the subsection (3)(c) shortfall fee. Rather, the Board determined that the shortfall fee would be imposed only on “persons holding a spirits distribution license.” WAC 314-23-025. Thus, while the Board requires that both distributors and distillers pay the subsection (3)(a) percentage fee, only distributors paid the subsection (3)(c) shortfall fee.</p>

The distillers generated approximately $15 million in sales arising from their distribution rights; the $1.5 million fees collected from these sales did not contribute to the $150 million statutory requirement. The combined fees assessed on persons holding a spirits distributor license totaled just over $45.3 million, leaving a $104.7 million shortfall. Pursuant to WAC 314-23-025, spirits distributor license holders paid this entire amount. The overwhelming majority of sales in Washington were from spirits distributors; had the distillers been required to pay the subsection (3)(c) shortfall fee, the distillers would have been responsible for only $3 million of what would have been a $103.2 million shortfall.</p>

Likewise, “spirits importer’s licenses,” RCW 66-.24.160, and “spirits . . . certificate of approval” licenses, RCW 66.24.640, have their own specific legal definitions. The “spirits distributor license” is created and defined by RCW 66.24.055(1), and subsection (3)(c) requires “all persons holding spirits distributor licenses” to pay “collectively one hundred fifty million dollars or more in spirits distributor license fees.” Thus, the plain language of the subsection (3)(c) shortfall fee applies only to persons holding the specifically defined “spirits distributor license” created in subsection (1).</p>

Additionally, subsection (3)(d) clarifies that a retailer must pay the fee on sales if no spirits distributor has paid the fee on the spirits sold.

Subsection (3)(c) then provides that “persons holding spirits distributor licenses” must contribute proportionately to any shortfall between the 10 percent fee and $150 million. The Association reasons that distillers who distribute their spirits to retailers are acting as “spirits distributor licensee [s]” under subsection (3)(a) and are therefore “persons holding spirits distributor licenses” under subsection (3)(c). Thus, the Association reasons that distillers must contribute to the $150 million shortfall proportionately based on their total distribution of their <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>products. In making this argument, the Association also points out that RCW 66.24.640 and RCW 66.28.330(4) requires that distillers who distribute their own spirits must comply with the applicable statutes and regulations relating to distributors.

Less than one month later, he turned 18 years old. Maynard’s counsel did not move for an order to extend the court’s statutory jurisdiction as provided in RCW 13.40-.300(l)(a) before Maynard turned 18. As a result, the juvenile court ruled that it had lost jurisdiction and dismissed the case without prejudice. The State then filed the case in superior court. Maynard moved to dismiss, arguing that preaccusatorial delay and ineffective assistance of counsel deprived him of the benefits of juvenile court jurisdiction, including the opportunity to accept a plea offer from the State.

Maynard gave a signed confession. He admitted that he defaced several local properties with graffiti and also provided the names of other participants. Maynard had just turned 17 years old on August 1.</p>

These documents included a probable cause statement, which gave amounts for each victim’s property damage along with Maynard’s confession.

The prosecutor received the requested information on November 17, and turned the case over to the juvenile court for consideration of diversion.

Maynard’s attorney did not notice that her client would soon turn 18, even though the information clearly stated her client’s date of birth. She also did not ask her client about his birthday. Consequently, Maynard’s attorney did not move at the <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>arraignment to extend juvenile court jurisdiction, which the court must extend before the juvenile defendant turns 18 or else it loses authority to adjudicate the case. <em>See </em>RCW 13.40.300(l)(a).</p>

Without an extension of jurisdiction, the juvenile court lost authority over the case and dismissed the charges without prejudice.</p>

He moved to dismiss the charges with prejudice based on two arguments. First, he argued that negligent preaccu-satorial delay violated his due process rights because the delay resulted in the loss of juvenile jurisdiction. Second, he argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to extend juvenile court jurisdiction before he turned 18.

Consequently, she did not move to extend the juvenile court’s jurisdiction before he turned 18, not because of a legitimate tactic but because of an absence of judgment.

Though the stated reason for the delay in bringing charges was to gather more information on the case, the prosecutor relied entirely on the probable cause statement prepared at the time of the arrest when filing charges. Twenty days after he first appeared in juvenile court, Maynard turned 18. No party mentioned his impending birthday to the court, nor did any party move to extend juvenile jurisdiction before he turned 18. As a result, Maynard lost the benefit of having his case adjudicated in juvenile court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">3</a> The majority places full responsibility for the loss of juvenile jurisdiction on Maynard’s defense attorney and fails to acknowledge that the prosecutor’s lengthy and — on this record — unjustified delays significantly contributed to the loss of juvenile jurisdiction.

But the State effectively waived that interest by delaying prosecution for 11 months. The fundamental conceptions of justice would be violated by allowing the prosecution to proceed. <em>See Oppelt, </em>172 Wn.2d at 287, 289-90 (describing the “core question” that must be answered when analyzing claims of preaccusatorial delay). I would hold that the combined effect of both unjustified preaccusatorial delay and ineffective assistance of counsel in this case denied Maynard fair treatment in the adversary criminal process in violation of his constitutional rights. The only meaningful remedy is to dismiss.</p>

This is contrary to RCW 13.40.300(l)(a), which states that a juvenile court may retain jurisdiction over a defendant past his or her 18th birthday <em>“only if </em>prior to the juvenile’s eighteenth birthday... the court by written order setting forth its reasons extends jurisdiction of juvenile court over the juvenile beyond his or her eighteenth birthday.” (Emphasis added.) As the majority suggests no reason why this statute would not apply, I must respectfully dissent to that holding as well.</p>

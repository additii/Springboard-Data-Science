Kelley then looked and saw some whiskey in a fruit jar on a table which he had not seen before.

Witness Herrington testified that he cooked for Kelley at .the restaurant, and was the only” one of' the cooks who worked that night, and that when he washed the dishes and closed up at nine o’clock there was no whiskey in the kitchen.</p>

As tending to show that the whiskey did not belong to Kelley, it was competent to show that the whiskey was drugged, for the jury might well have found that Kelley would not place a drug in liquor so powerful that one drink of ’ it would render him unconscious for a day, and the fact that he was robbed is a circumstance to be taken.into account in determining the truth about the ownership and posses- ■ sion .of the whiskey.</p>

He then presented his claim to the county court, which was allowed in the sum of $750. A warrant was issued to him for this amount, and paid. This was a final judgment.

    <p id="b393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[145,588,1205,1060]]]'>When Farmer failed to appeal from the .judgment of allowance in his favor for $750 he lost his right to any further claim under the contract. It was not a case where separate allowances were due him, under different claims. The contract was an entire one, and the order and judgment of allowance in his favor for $750 operated as a dis-allowance of thfe 'balance of his claim, and he lost all rights thereafter by failing to appeal to the circuit court within the time prescribed by statute. The notation made by the county judge upon the second presentation of the claim did not amount to a final judgment in favor of Farmer. In <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Barron, </em><a href="/ark/144/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="144 Ark. 422" data-case-ids="1587945" data-case-paths="/ark/144/0422-01">144 Ark. 422</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=222%20S.W.%20712" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="222 S.W. 712">222 S. W. 712</a>, where the court made a finding that plaintiff was entitled to a judgment, hut did not enter judgment therefor until a later date, it was held that the time of taking an appeal runs from the date of the entry of the judgment. No judgment was entered in favor of Farmer for the $150, nor was any judgment for that amount rendered. Hence there was nothing to appeal from, as far as the notation, “O. K. in the sum of $150, but no funds,” is concerned.</p>

He bases his right to recover upon the presentation of this claim upon the fact that, on the original presentation of the claim, the county court did not intend to make a judgment of allowance but only intended to make a judgment authorizing the issuance of a warrant in his favor for $750. The record, however, shows that he presented his claim for the whole amount alleged to be due in the sum of $1,345. The county court made a judgment of allowance in his favor for $750, and, as above stated, this- operated as a. disallowance of his claim for the balance.

In <em>Brown, </em>the district court denied retained counsel’s motion to withdraw to permit the defendant to obtain a public defender, who would have required a continuance to prepare for trial. <a href="/f3d/785/1337-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="785 F.3d 1337" data-case-ids="4182346" data-case-paths="/f3d/785/1337-01">785 F.3d at 1341-43</a>. The Ninth Circuit reversed, criticizing the district court for “focus [ing] on considerations pertinent to the right to constitutionally adequate counsel, rather than to the right to choice of counsel Brown actually enjoyed.” <em><a href="/f3d/785/1337-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="785 F.3d 1337" data-case-ids="4182346" data-case-paths="/f3d/785/1337-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/785/1337-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="785 F.3d 1337" data-case-ids="4182346" data-case-paths="/f3d/785/1337-01">at 1347</a>. The Ninth Circuit then held, in contrast to the majority’s holding here, “Brown’s <em>reasons </em>for wanting to discharge his retained lawyer were not properly the court’s concern at all.” <em><a href="/f3d/785/1337-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="785 F.3d 1337" data-case-ids="4182346" data-case-paths="/f3d/785/1337-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/785/1337-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="785 F.3d 1337" data-case-ids="4182346" data-case-paths="/f3d/785/1337-01">at </a><a id="p677" href="#p677" data-label="677" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*677</a><a href="/f3d/785/1337-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="785 F.3d 1337" data-case-ids="4182346" data-case-paths="/f3d/785/1337-01">1348</a>. Additionally, the Ninth Circuit in <em>Brown </em>cited three indications that the trial court did not deny the motion to discharge counsel because of the demands of its calendar: (1) the court did not indicate that it denied the motion because of concern for its calendar, (2) the court offered to continue the case for the retained attorney for “ ‘whatever time he needled] before we finally go to trial,’ ” and continued the trial for one month after the hearing, and (3) the court never determined how long a continuance would be necessary to allow Brown’s newly appointed attorney to prepare. <em><a href="/f3d/785/1337-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="785 F.3d 1337" data-case-ids="4182346" data-case-paths="/f3d/785/1337-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/785/1337-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="785 F.3d 1337" data-case-ids="4182346" data-case-paths="/f3d/785/1337-01">at 1349</a> (alteration in original).

In denying the continuance in this case, the trial court also failed to determine the length of the requested continuance, continued the case for a few days for the lawyer already on the case, and made no finding about inability to accommodate any further continuance. The trial court in this case also cited the appointed attorney’s readiness and qualifications and stated, “I’m not really being given much reason other than apparently some other source decided to provide the funds today when it was still a serious case.” VBP (Aug. 31, 2012) at 8. But under Brown—and <em>Gonzalez-</em>Lopez—that’s all that is relevant; the trial court’s satisfaction with existing counsel is not. Other courts following <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>have reached the same conclusion in the same context. <em>E.g., People v. Brown, </em><a href="/p3d/322/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="2014 CO 25" data-case-ids="6943810" data-case-paths="/p3d/322/0214-01">2014 CO 25</a>, ¶ 2, <a href="/p3d/322/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="2014 CO 25" data-case-ids="6943810" data-case-paths="/p3d/322/0214-01">322 P.3d 214</a> (when deciding whether to grant a continuance to allow a defendant to change counsel, trial court must conduct a multifactor balancing test and assess whether the public’s interest in the efficiency and integrity of the judicial system outweighs the defendant’s right to counsel of choice; remand for trial court to make findings about <a id="p678" href="#p678" data-label="678" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*678</a>factors court should have considered, including how long it would take retained counsel to prepare for trial, length of any requested continuance, and the court’s docket and whether the continuance would cause significant inconvenience for witnesses).</p>
    <p id="b720-4" data-blocks='[["BL_720.4",720,[202,628,1247,796]]]'>¶42 A trial court abuses its discretion when it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or applies the wrong legal standard. <em>State v. Rafay, </em><a href="/wash-2d/167/0644-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="167 Wash. 2d 644" data-case-ids="4004790" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/167/0644-01">167 Wn.2d 644</a>, 655, <a href="/citations/?q=222%20P.3d%2086" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="222 P.3d 86">222 P.3d 86</a> (2009). The trial court applied the wrong legal standard, and therefore abused its discretion, when it considered Hampton’s appointed lawyer’s positive performance and failed to assess or even ascertain the length of the continuance requested, or whether such a continuance would cause undue delay. This improper denial of Hampton’s request for a continuance denied him his right to retain his chosen attorney. This erroneous deprivation of the right to counsel of choice constitutes structural error requiring automatic reversal. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em><a href="/us/548/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="548 U.S. 140" data-case-ids="3500367" data-case-paths="/us/548/0140-01">548 U.S. at </a>149-50 (citing <em>Sullivan v.

    <p id="b720-6" data-blocks='[["BL_720.6",720,[201,1580,1247,684]]]'>¶43 <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>makes clear that the right to retain counsel of choice is fundamental, constitutional, and weighty. It also prohibits trial courts from evaluating the defendant’s satisfaction with his appointed attorney when ruling on a continuance to retain counsel of choice. The trial court and the majority here, however, do exactly that. The majority compounds the error by adopting a test that (1) instructs trial courts to continue considering appointed counsel’s positive performance when deciding whether to grant a continuance to retain counsel of choice and (2) fails to clarify that slight inconvenience cannot outweigh the right to retain counsel of choice. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>

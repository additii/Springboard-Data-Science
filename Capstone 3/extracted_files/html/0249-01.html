The reason is beneficiaries in insurance policies, as well as other persons, are obliged to pay judgments against them in favor of third persons and exemptions from execution and other process of the court are fixed by the sections of the Constitution above referred to. The statute in question was not enacted for the purpose of allowing beneficiaries exemptions which they are not entitled to under the Constitution and laws of this State, but the act was passed for the purpose of exempting these funds from the operation of our general statutes regulating issuance of garnishments and proceedings thereunder. ’ ’</p>

The cashier, on his own initiative, suggested that he did not care to press the makers of the note for payment, but that if he (King) would cause $400 to be paid on the note the time for the payment of the balance would be extended, and King released from further liability. Acting upon this suggestion, King saw the makers of the note and had them to pay the sum of $400 on the note. About two days later King called at the bank to see if this payment had been made. Only the assistant cashier was present in the bank at that time, but that officer, who was familiar with all the facts, promised to call the matter to the attention of the cashier. Relying on this promise, appellant King gave the matter no further attention until this suit was brought.</p>

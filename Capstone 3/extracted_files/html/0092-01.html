The case was on trial before a jury, when, at the conclusion of the introduction of testimony, each side requested the court to direct a verdict in its favor, and no other instruction was asked. Thereupon, the court directed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiffs for $475. Thirteen days later the defendant requested the court to make special findings of fact, which the court declined to do. Judgment was rendered in accordance with the verdict previously directed, and this appeal has been prosecuted to reverse that judgment.</p>
    <p id="b111-7" data-blocks='[["BL_111.14",111,[162,1609,1201,504]]]'>The policy sued on provided that, “if the interest of the assured in the subject of the insurance be or become other than unconditional and sole lawful ownership,” no recovery should be had thereon, and, further, that there should be no liability under the policy if, at the time damage by fire occurred, there should be other outstanding fire insurance. The answer alleged that there was additional insurance, and that plaintiffs were not the sole and unconditional owners of the' car at the time it was destroyed by fire.</p>

The Mixon company transferred the sales contract and note to the General Motors Acceptance Cor<a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>poration, and liad nothing to do with the collection of the note. On June 26, 1931, Pruitt purchased the car from Miller &amp; Lambert, who took, in payment of the unpaid purchase money, the note of the purchaser, payable to Motor Finance Association, which company carried a blanket policy of insurance with appellant, Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Insurance Company, covering cars the purchase money notes for which had been assigned to it. This policy is referred to as the master policy, and contemplated insurance on such cars as the Motor Finance Association might become interested in as the owner of purchase-money notes. As insurance on any particular car was desired, the Motor Finance Association gave certain data with reference to the kind of car, motor number, purchaser, cost to purchaser, terms of purchase, and requested insurance on the car to be included in the master policy; whereupon the appellant insurance company, through its local agent, would issue to the Motor Finance Association, and to the purchaser whose note it had acquired, a certificate showing that the car described was insured under the master policy. The' insurance thus effected was payable, first, to the holders and indorsers of any unpaid purchase money notes to the extent of their interest, and the remainder, if any, to the purchaser of the car. The certificate or policy here sued on was payable, first, to- the Motor Finance Association, and, second, to Pruitt in the manner stated, and the judgment rendered so provided.</p>

He took out no insurance, and knew nothing about insurance. He assigned the sales contract and note to the General Motors Company. He received notice from that company that the note had been paid, but the notice did not advise when payment had been made, and he did not know whether the note had been paid before December 1, 1931, the date of the fire.</p>
    <p id="b113-3" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[152,870,1199,445]]]'>The local agent who issued the policy or certificate sued on testified that no representations were made as to other insurance on the car, and that the only information which he had as the company’s agent in issuing the policy was obtained from the application of the Motor Finance Association, and that he had no contract with Pruitt. Neither the Motor Finance Association nor Pruitt knew there was other insurance on the car, or another title claimant thereto.</p>

A claim was filed under this policy by Miller, but was disallowed for the reason stated, and the claim was abandoned by Miller.</p>

Mixon testified, however, that the note was returned to him before its maturity marked paid; and, in the absence of proof as to the date of payment, we think there is no presumption that the note had not been paid at the time of the fire.</p>

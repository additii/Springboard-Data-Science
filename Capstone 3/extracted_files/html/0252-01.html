As a publicly traded company, CHS <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>is required to file reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports are available publicly for the purpose of accurately advising the SEC, and CHS’s creditors and investors, of CHS’s profitability and business strategies. As Rockwood’s CFO, Becker was required by state and federal law to ensure that Rockwood’s reports did not mislead the public, which also required his personal verification that the reports did not contain any inaccurate material facts or material omissions. As the CFO, Becker himself was potentially criminally liable for misleading reporting. In October 2011, Becker submitted to CHS’s financial department an “EBIDTA,” a calculation of earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, and amortization—it serves as an important measure of financial health for publicly traded companies. Becker’s EBIDTA report projected a $12 million operating loss for Rockwood the upcoming year.</p>
    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.4",298,[201,1282,1248,413]]]'>¶3 Unbeknown to Becker, when CHS acquired Rock-wood it represented to creditors that the Rockwood acquisition would incur only a $4 million operating loss. To cover the discrepancy, CHS’s financial supervisors allegedly directed Becker to correct his EBIDTA to reflect the targeted $4 million loss. CHS did not provide a basis for its low calculation. Becker refused, fearing that the projection would mislead creditors and investors in violation of SOX.</p>
    <p id="b298-5" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[201,1728,1247,421]]]'>¶4 Soon after, Rockwood’s chief executive officer (CEO) initiated an unscheduled evaluation of Becker’s performance in which the CEO marked him with an unacceptable performance rating and placed him on a performance improvement plan. As part of his improvement plan, Becker was directed to edit the EBIDTA projected loss to reflect the $4 million valuation. The CEO made clear that Becker’s refusal to do so put his position in jeopardy.</p>

    <p id="b299-5" data-blocks='[["BL_299.5",299,[197,1079,1251,796]]]'>¶7 CHS filed a CR 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, contending that the jeopardy element of the tort had not been met because there were adequate alternative means to protect the public policy of honesty in corporate financial reporting. The trial court denied the motion, and CHS successfully moved to have the question certified for interlocutory review under RAP 2.3(b)(4). The Court of Appeals accepted review and determined that the jeopardy element had been satisfied because the alternative administrative enforcement mechanisms of SOX and Dodd-Frank were inadequate and therefore did not foreclose the common law tort remedies for employees. <em>Becker v.

When other statutory remedies provide alternative remedies to protect the public policy, we concluded that exclusivity, not adequacy, is the key inquiry.

It is recognized as a means of encouraging employees to follow the law and preventing employers from using the at-will doctrine to subvert those efforts to promote public policy. To state a cause of action, the plaintiff must plead and prove that his or her termination was motivated by reasons that contravene an important mandate of public policy. We maintain a strict clarity requirement in which the plaintiff must establish that the public policy is clearly legislatively or judicially recognized. Once established, the burden shifts to the employer to plead and prove that the employee’s termination was motivated by other, legitimate, reasons. <em>Thompson v.

When the plaintiff’s case does not fit neatly within one of these scenarios, a more refined analysis may be necessary, and the four-factor Perritt analysis may provide helpful guidance. <em>Gardner, </em>128 Wn.2d at 941 (citing Henry H.

    <p id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[201,1087,1253,479]]]'>¶12 But such detailed analysis is unnecessary here. Becker’s complaint alleges that he was terminated for refusing to criminally misrepresent the EBIDTA report of Rockwood’s operating losses. His case falls squarely within the first scenario—termination for refusal to commit an illegal act. Taking his allegations as true, as we must when reviewing a motion to dismiss, Becker has pleaded sufficient facts to establish a claim that his discharge was in violation of clear, important public policy.</p>
    <p id="b301-6" data-blocks='[["BL_301.6",301,[202,1591,1252,421]],["BL_302.1",302,[202,345,1246,414]]]'>¶13 As to the potential exclusionary effects of alternative statutes, we review these statutes for exclusivity, not adequacy. For the same reasons discussed in <em>Rose, </em>we reject the argument that the adequacy of alternative remedies approach plays any legitimate role in our analysis. If SOX and Dodd-Frank already protect whistle-blowers from termination, then the availability of this alternative method of recovery does not impact the employer’s discretion to ter-<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>mínate employees without cause. The elimination of this adequacy requirement has no effect on the breadth of the at-will doctrine; rather, its removal from our analysis merely eliminates a loophole for employers who intentionally contravene public policy to escape liability. Once a plaintiff can establish that the employer’s actions violate an important mandate of public policy, no legitimate reason exists for excusing those actions.</p>
    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[201,780,1253,1360]]]'>¶14 In support of the “strict adequacy” requirement, CHS also argues that the concurrent availability of this tort with SOX and Dodd-Frank would undermine the statutes’ goal in encouraging whistle-blowers. SOX provides relief only for those employees who actually report, not those who merely refuse to violate the law. CHS argues that the tort would encourage employees to “sit on their hands” rather than report violations because the concurrent availability of the tort would reward those employees for their indifference by providing relief when they deserve none. Without addressing the numerous flaws to this argument, we maintain that it is with the proper authority of Congress and the legislature to address that concern by expressly limiting remedies only to those provided by the statute. Congress and the legislature possess greater relative competency to determine how and when employees should be afforded remedies for their termination, and retain the authority to determine when its administrative remedies should be exclusive. Here, Congress expressly declared that the remedies available under SOX and Dodd-Frank supplement rather than preclude state or federal remedies. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. § 1514A(d); 15 U.S.C. § 78u-6(h)(3). We respect Congress’ choice to avail these administrative remedies in addition to our existing common law, and we decline to contravene that intent by barring Becker from full adjudication of his claim.</p>

Taking these allegations as true, as we must at this stage of review, Rockwood and CHS directed Becker to commit a crime for which he would be personally responsible.

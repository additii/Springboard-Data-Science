Fifteen-year-old K.L.B. was charged with making a false or misleading statement to FEO Brett Willet under RCW 9A.76.175, which provides that it is a misdemeanor to knowingly make “a false or misleading material statement to a public servant.” The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s conclusion that under the statute, FEO Willet was a public servant at the time K.L.B. made the false statement. We hold that under these circumstances, because FEOs are not government employees, are not officers of government, and do not perform a governmental function, they are not “public servants” as defined by the statute. Therefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals.</p>

The FEOs asked the three males for identification once they exited the train. All three were either unable or unwilling to provide identification. K.L.B. identified himself to FEO Willet as Kinds M.

K.L.B. gave his correct name and birth date to Deputy Adams after the deputy warned him that it was a crime to lie to a police officer. Deputy Adams then asked K.L.B. to identify one of his male companions.

Therefore, an FEO can possibly be an “officer” only under the second part of the statute, which provides that an “officer” can include someone “lawfully exercising or assuming to exercise any of the powers or functions of a <em>public </em>officer.” RCW 9A.04.110(13) (emphasis added). While the State and the Court of Appeals have pointed out statutory powers granted to Sound Transit and to FEOs generally, neither has directed us to the person holding public office whose power the FEOs are lawfully exercising. As mentioned, FEOs do not exercise all powers police officers have. In essence, they can check riders to verify valid tickets exist and eject passengers who have not paid. Anything more and the FEO summons the police. Therefore, a Sound Transit FEO cannot be “exercising or assuming to exercise any of the powers or functions” of someone who does not exist.</p>

FEOs monitor compliance with fare collection. If someone has not paid their fare, they can be removed from the train and under certain circumstances given a citation.

An “enforcement officer” is defined as “a person authorized to enforce the provisions of the title or ordinance in which the civil infraction is established.” RCW 7.80.040. Through these provisions, Sound Transit is statutorily authorized to employ directly or contract for the services of officers who are charged with enforcing the provisions involving civil infractions.</p>

RCW 10.93.020(4) defines “limited authority Washington peace officer” as “any full-time, fully compensated officer of a limited authority Washington law enforcement agency empowered by that agency to detect or apprehend violators of the laws in some or all of the limited subject areas for which <a id="p752" href="#p752" data-label="752" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*752</a>that agency is responsible.” <em>See </em>RCW 10.93.080 (such officers shall have no additional powers by virtue of chapter 10.93 RCW).</p>
    <p id="b816-4" data-blocks='[["BL_816.5",816,[213,521,1250,695]]]'>¶35 I conclude that FEOs fall under several plain language statutory definitions of “officer” relating to their fare enforcement duties. Interpreting these provisions consistently with RCW 9A.04.110(23) and RCW 9A.04.110(13) vindicates the legislature’s intent to define FEOs as public servants, whether employed directly by the government or through private security firms. <em>See State v. Velasquez, </em><a href="/wash-2d/176/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="176 Wash. 2d 333" data-case-ids="4306731" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/176/0333-01">176 Wn.2d 333</a>, 336, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20P.3d%2092" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="292 P.3d 92">292 P.3d 92</a> (2013) (“related statutory provisions must be harmonized to effectuate a consistent statutory scheme that maintains the integrity of the respective statutes”). FEO Willet satisfies the definition of “officer” found in RCW 9A.04.110(13) and is, therefore, a public servant.</p>
    <p id="b816-5" data-blocks='[["BL_816.6",816,[215,1245,1248,415]]]'>¶36 Finally, it makes little sense for the legislature to create the fare enforcement system but fail to give its officers any workable enforcement mechanism. Because the majority holds that FEOs are not public servants, passengers can lie to them without legal repercussions, making it impossible to enforce the fare policy and issue infractions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_8" id="ref_footnote_3_8">14</a> Without a passenger’s name and address, it is impossible to issue an infraction for fare evasion.</p>

The nature of FEO Willet’s employment on August 6, 2010, satisfies the definition in two ways: (1) he was performing a governmental function and (2) he was an officer of government.

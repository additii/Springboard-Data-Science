A notice informed her that in order to gain access to her home, she must call defendant Nationstar Mortgage LLC to obtain the lockbox code and retrieve the new key inside. Although she eventually reentered her home, she removed her belongings the next day and has not returned since. Jordan’s home loan was secured by a deed of trust, a commonly used security instrument that was created as an alternative to traditional mortgages to provide for a simpler method of foreclosure. The deed of trust contained provisions that allowed Na-tionstar to enter her home upon default without providing any notice to the homeowner. Today, we are asked to decide whether those provisions conflict with Washington law.</p>

The first question asks whether the deed of trust provisions conflict with a Washington law that prohibits a lender from taking possession of property prior to foreclosure. We hold that it does because the provisions allow Nationstar to take possession of the property after default, which conflicts with the statute. The second question asks whether Washington’s statutory receivership scheme—providing for a third party to possess and manage property in lieu of either the <a id="p880" href="#p880" data-label="880" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*880</a>lender or homeowner—is the exclusive remedy by which a lender may gain access to the property. As explained below, we hold nothing in our law establishes the receivership statutes as an exclusive remedy.</p>

    <p id="b934-4" data-blocks='[["BL_934.5",934,[202,725,1245,420]]]'>¶3 In 2007, Jordan bought a home in Wenatchee, Washington, with a home loan of $172,000 from Homecomings Financial. She secured the loan by signing a deed of trust. The original lender assigned the loan to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), one of the nation’s largest mortgagees that primarily participates in the secondary mortgage market, which hired Nationstar to service the loan.</p>
    <p id="b934-5" data-blocks='[["BL_934.6",934,[201,1179,1248,908]]]'>¶4 Jordan went into default on her mortgage payments in January 2011. In March 2011, one of Nationstar’s vendors came to Jordan’s home and changed the locks on her front door. Jordan returned home to find a notice on the front door informing her that the property was found to be “unsecure or vacant” and that to protect her and the mortgagee’s interest in the property, it was “secured against entry by unauthorized persons to prevent possible damage.” Order Certifying Questions to Wash. Supreme Ct., <em>Jordan v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, </em>No. 2:14-CV-0175-TOR at 6 (E.D. Wash. Aug. 10, 2015). While the above-noted facts are undisputed, the parties dispute whether the home was vacant. Jordan contends she was living there, left for work that morning as usual, and returned to find the lockbox and notice. On the other hand, Nationstar contends that its vendor performed an inspection of the property and determined it was vacant.</p>
    <p id="b934-6" data-blocks='[["BL_934.7",934,[201,2120,1248,259]],["BL_935.1",935,[202,345,1246,539]]]'>¶5 Upon finding the notice when she returned home, Jordan called the phone number provided and got the key from the lockbox to reenter her home. She took all of her belongings and vacated the house the next day. Since then, Nationstar’s vendor has maintained the property’s exterior <a id="p881" href="#p881" data-label="881" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*881</a>and winterized the interior. Nationstar does not claim to have attempted to provide Jordan any notice of its intention to inspect the property and rekey it. Nationstar contends that its usual practice is to change the locks on only one door, such that it can access the home in the future, but also so that the owner can still enter the home through another door. Here, Jordan’s home had only a front door and a sliding glass door in the rear of the home. Therefore, when Nationstar’s vendor rekeyed the front door, she had no means of entry.</p>
    <p id="b935-4" data-blocks='[["BL_935.4",935,[201,910,1248,969]]]'>¶6 Jordan represents a certified class of 3,600 Washington homeowners who were locked out of their homes pursuant to similar provisions in their deeds of trust with Nationstar. This case presents an important issue for these homeowners and the thousands of others subject to similar provisions, as well as the many mortgage companies that have a concern with preserving and protecting the properties in which they have an interest. Three amicus briefs were filed in this case: Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the city of Spokane, supporting defendant Nationstar, and the Northwest Consumer Law Center, supporting plaintiff Jordan. Freddie Mac tells us that the provisions such as the ones at issue here are important to the foreclosure process because they allow lenders to enter the property to maintain and secure it. Freddie Mac contends that such provisions help meet its requirements that it imposes on companies like Nationstar to preserve properties.</p>

Nationstar removed the action to the United States District Court for the <a id="p882" href="#p882" data-label="882" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*882</a>Eastern District of Washington (District Court). The parties each filed motions for partial summary judgment. Nation-star asked the District Court to find the provisions at issue enforceable under Washington law. Jordan asked the District Court to find that before the lender can enter a borrower’s property, the lender must obtain either the borrower’s postdefault consent or permission from a court. Furthermore, Jordan contends that receivership is the only remedy by which a lender may gain access to the borrower’s property. Finding that the case raised unresolved questions of Washington state law, the District Court certified two questions to us. We accepted the following certified questions.</p>

We must determine whether these provisions contravene Washington law. As described below, the deed of trust provisions authorize a lender to enter the borrower’s property after default. The parties agree that a Washington statute prohibits a lender from taking possession of a borrower’s property prior to foreclosure. The controversial issue here is whether the deed of trust provisions allowing the lender to enter constitute taking possession prior to foreclosure, such that they conflict with state law. Based on Nationstar’s practices, we find that the provisions do allow the lender to take possession and thus they are in conflict with state law. As such, we answer the first certified question in the negative.</p>

Nationstar hinges its argument on the need to secure abandoned property, stating it does not enter occupied property. However, the provision plainly states that the lender may “secure” the property after the borrower defaults <em>or </em>abandons the property. The provision specifically lists changing the locks as a method of securing the property. Thus, the provisions authorize the lender to enter and rekey the property solely upon default, regardless of whether the borrower has abandoned the property.</p>

The foregoing possession definitions, as well as <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Aldrich, </em>are instructive. Nationstar’s vendor’s actions constituted possession because its actions are representative of control. The vendor drilled out Jordan’s existing locks and replaced the lock with its own. Nationstar stated in its brief that it rekeyed Jordan’s property to allow itself access to return to secure the property by winterizing it and to make repairs. Def.’s Answering Br. at 33-34. Perhaps that is true; however, rekeying the property also had the effect of communicating to Jordan that Nationstar now controlled the property. The action left Jordan with no method of entering her own property. Nationstar relies on the fact that it did not change the locks to exclude Jordan (because it provided her a lockbox and phone number to call) to provide proof that it did not possess the premises. However, although she was able to obtain a key by calling, the process made Nationstar the “middle man.” She could no longer access her home without going through Nationstar. This action of changing the locks and allowing her a key only after contacting Nationstar for the lockbox code is a clear expression of control. Although Nationstar did not exclude Jordan from the premises (as she was able to gain a key and enter), she left the next day and did not return. In its amicus brief, the Northwest Consumer Law Center advised us anecdotally that many similarly situated Washington homeowners felt that when the lender changed the locks to their homes, they no longer had a right to continue to possess the property. <em>See </em>Br. of Amicus Curiae Nw.

Although <a id="p889" href="#p889" data-label="889" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*889</a>the mortgagee-mortgagor context is different from the landlord-tenant context, <em>Aldrich </em>provides an apt analogy here because the court there found that changing the tenant’s locks was the most striking showing of a reas-sumption of possession. <a href="/wash-app/12/0665-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="12 Wash.

By changing the locks, Nationstar took possession of the property. Since these actions are authorized by the entry provisions, the entry provisions allow the lender to take possession of the property. Because Washington law prohibits lenders from taking possession of the borrower’s property before foreclosure, the provisions are in conflict with state law.

It is undisputed that the deed of <a id="p895" href="#p895" data-label="895" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*895</a>trust’s entry provisions were contractually agreed to and authorized Nationstar to change the locks on Jordan’s home after default.

The majority does so by describing the entry provisions as authorizing the lender to take “possession.” <em>Id. </em>at 884-85, 888. But the certified question asks not whether lenders can take “possession” of property before foreclosure. Instead, it asks whether the lender can “enter, maintain, and secure the encumbered property” before foreclosure. Order Certifying Questions to Wash. Supreme Court, <em>Jordan v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, </em>No. 2:14-CV-0175-TOR at 9 (E.D. Wash. Aug. 10, 2015).

At the outset, the majority’s reliance on the <em>Restatement </em>is misplaced. Restatement (Third) of Prop: Mortgages § 4.1 (Am. Law. Inst. 1997). The <em>Restatement </em>does not contemplate entry provisions, like those considered here, but rather a lender taking possession. The <em>Restatement </em>merely reiterates the general rule against accelerated preforeclosure possession of property. In illustrative applications of this rule, the <em>Restatement </em>examines instances where the mortgagee has “file [d] an action to obtain possession of [the property].” <em>Id. </em>cmt. b, illus. 1-3. Here, however, Nationstar has not filed an action to obtain possession of Jordan’s property. Instead, after Jordan defaulted on her loan, Nationstar took contractually authorized steps to secure the abandoned property—and it <a id="p896" href="#p896" data-label="896" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*896</a>posted instructions on how Jordan could access the property, consistent with her continued right of possession.</p>
    <p id="b950-3" data-blocks='[["BL_950.4",950,[201,471,1252,1035]]]'>¶49 Neither of the two Court of Appeals decisions cited by the majority support equating the entry provisions to possession. <em>Aldrich v. Olson </em>does not even interpret “possession” in RCW 7.28.230(1). <a href="/wash-app/12/0665-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="12 Wash. App. 665" data-case-ids="1855735" data-case-paths="/wash-app/12/0665-01">12 Wn.

Hoffman </em>merely clarifies the difference between the right to possession (applicable to foreclosure actions) and actual possession (applicable to premises liability matters): “Although RCW 7.28.230 effectively precludes a mortgagee from obtaining possession of property to the mortgagor’s exclusion, the statute does not bear on the question of whether a mortgagee actually possesses the property. Actual possession, not a right to possession, is the critical inquiry in premises liability cases.” <a href="/wash-app/115/0853-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="115 Wash. App. 853" data-case-ids="222286" data-case-paths="/wash-app/115/0853-01">115 Wn.

But unlike the landlords in <em>Aldrich </em>and <em>Coleman, </em>Nationstar never possessed the property to Jordan’s exclusion. Rather, Nationstar provided Jordan with instructions on how to enter her home if she returned. At no point did Nationstar ever object to Jordan’s continued right to possession before foreclosure.</p>

The <em>Restatement </em>recognizes three exceptions to the general rule that mortgagees cannot obtain possession of the mortgagor’s property before foreclosure: (1) mortgagor consent, (2) mortgagee’s possession as the result of peaceful entry in good faith after purchasing the property at a void or voidable foreclosure sale, and (3) mortgagor abandonment. Restatement § 4.1 cmt. c. Here, the evidence supported Nationstar securing Jordan’s home under the mortgagor abandonment exception. Months after Jordan defaulted on her loan, Nationstar inspected Jordan’s property and determined that it was vacant. Nationstar then changed the locks, which it was allowed to do under the <a id="p897" href="#p897" data-label="897" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*897</a>entry provisions in order to secure the property. <em>Cf.

Wis. 2014) (dismissing trespass claim against lender for changing a homeowner’s locks upon default because the mortgage agreement authorizing the lender to secure the premises upon default or abandonment created an implied consent to entry); <em>see also Tennant v.

Civ. App. 2015). Moreover, public policy considerations support Nationstar securing Jordan’s abandoned property: “Not only is it important to protect the [property] against the elements and vandalism, but society is benefited by [the property’s] productive use.” Restatement § 4.1 cmt. c.</p>

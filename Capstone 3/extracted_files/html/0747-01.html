It was after-wards diverted to Salt Lake City, and then diverted to Butte, Montana. The car was delivered to the railroad company in Van Burén, Arkansas, on October 23, 1924, and a bill of lading was issued to the plaintiffs. The car was consigned to the Myers Commission Company, which was the partnership name of plaintiffs, at Electra, Texas, with directions to advise the Texas Produce Com<a id="p748" href="#p748" data-label="748" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*748</a>pany and to allow inspection and deliver on tibe written order of the Myers Commission Company. The car was transported from Yan Burén to Electra on schedule time, and arrived at Electra in good condition on the 27th. day of October, 1924. The Texas Produce Company was promptly notified of its arrival. A draft had been forwarded to- Electra, Texas, with the written order of the plaintiffs attached to it, for the delivery of the car upon the presentation of bill of lading and the payment of the freight. The agent of the Port Worth &amp; Denver City Railway Company at Electra, Texas, permitted an inspection of the car, and the representative of the Texas Produce Company got into the car and removed a number of baskets of the potatoes, and, and after this was learned by the railroad company, the agent then called on the Texas Produce Company, and it refused to take the car, although a portion of tlie contents had been removed and the bill of lading had not been surrendered.</p>

The railroad company then asked for disposition of the car, but tried to prevail on the Texas Produce Company to take up the draft, but the produce company refused to do this. The produce company, however, did pay the amount of freight, but did not bring the order which was attached to the draft at the bank. The company held the money that the produce company paid for the freight until it had instructions to divert the car.</p>

Plaintiff alleged that the potatoes were in good condition when received by the railroad company, and the bill of lading provided that the defendants should deliver said shipment to the consignee only upon the written or telegraphed order of J. W. Myers, but that, without receiving any such order, the railroad company carelessly and negligently permitted the Texas Produce Company to unload and dispose of about 100 bushels of said pota-toes_ without having paid the draft, and, without any written or telegraphed order from Myers, permitted the Texas Produce Company to take charge of said shipment, and that, after the produce company had paid the freight and disposed of a part of the potatoes, the railroad company permitted the produce company to purchase about 100 bushels of potatoes at a local market at Electra, Texas, and place them back in the car, to take the place of the potatoes that defendant had unlawfully allowed the produce company to take out, and the company returned to the produce company the freight, and then notified plaintiff that the produce company had refused to accept the car; that, by this action on the part of the railroad company, the car was delayed for a period of about five days, and potatoes of inferior quality were loaded- in the car.</p>

No. 1 grade of potatoes, consigned to the Myers Commission Company at Electra, Texas, notify Texas Procluce Company, with permission to inspect, and directions to the railroad to deliver the potatoes upon surrender of the bill of lading and written order of the Myers Commission Company; that he got no returns on the car, but understood that it had not been delivered; and he testified that he put in a long distance call and talked over the telephone to the agent of the railroad company, and afterwards received a wire from the agent; that he asked the agent if he had delivered the car and if they had paid the freight, and he said they had not. Witness said he told the agent that he had information that the Texas Produce Company had hauled 100 bushels of the potatoes off to Wichita Palls, and that, after another car came in, they filled up with other potatoes, put them in their place. Witness said they had a customer- in Butte, Montana, and got in touch with them and sold them the car, but that, when it got to Butte, it was in such bad condition they had to let the customer handle it for what they could get out of it. He said that the order attached to the draft on the car was as follows: “On presentation of this order, and after all freight charges have been paid, deliver to Texas Produce Company, Electra, Texas, Car A. B. T. 12497-sweet potatoes.”</p>

    <p id="b769-3" data-blocks='[["BL_769.4",769,[252,545,1202,742]]]'>We think that it is unnecessary to decide whether the railroad company, in this case, was an insurer, or simply liable for negligence, because, under the view we take of the case, the railroad company was negligent in permitting the Texas Produce Company to remove a part of the potatoes without the order from the shipper and without the bill of lading, and it was also negligent in its failure to notify the shipper in a reasonable time, and this would be true whether there were any contract or not, but, under the contract in this case, the carrier was prohibited from delivering the car to the Texas Produce Company without the written or telegraphed order of the shipper and without the payment of the draft and freight charges.</p>

The car was received on October 27, and, according to the proof in the case; ‘the carrier itself used no diligence, and did not know, until three or four days later, anything about the produce company having gone into the car, and had made no efforts to find out whether it had inspected or whether it intended to take the car. The Texas Produce Company was not the consignee, but was merely to be notified, and the carrier then was, under its contract, bound to deliver the car to the Texas Produce Company when <a id="p754" href="#p754" data-label="754" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*754</a>the written’ order was presented and payment was made according to the contract.</p>
    <p id="b770-3" data-blocks='[["BL_770.4",770,[282,471,1206,1110]]]'>“Where a bill of lading or a shipping receipt contains a clause providing that a third person shall be notified of the arrival of the goods, or where it contains this clause and an additional clause reciting that the goods are shipped to the consignor’s order, the carrier is not authorized to treat the person to be notified as a consignee, and, if it delivers the goods to him without production and surrender of the receipt or the bill of lading, it will be liable to the true owner of the goods for any loss resulting from such delivery. Delivery of the goods, under these circumstances, without surrender of the receipt or the bill of lading, constitutes a conversion. A direction of this character in a shipping receipt or a bill of lading raises no presumption that the person to be notified is the consignee, but, on the contrary, indicates that the carrier is not entitled to deliver the goods except on production of the bill of lading. The fact that a carrier was instructed to notify a third party of the arrival of goods gives him no right to require a delivery without the production and the surrender of the bill of lading, .properly indorsed.” 10 C.

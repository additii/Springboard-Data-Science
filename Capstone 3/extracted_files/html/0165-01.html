In this case, we are asked whether our vested rights doctrine applies to permit applications filed under plans and regulations that were later found to be noncompliant with the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), chapter 43.21C RCW. We hold that it does. Local land use plans and development regulations enacted under the Growth Management Act (GMA), chapter 36.70A RCW, are presumed valid upon adoption. Should a valid plan or regulation later be found to violate SEPA, the exclusive remedies provided by the GMA affect only future applications for development — not development rights that have already vested.</p>

    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[231,662,1248,317]]]'>¶3 The parties do not dispute the facts of this case. BSRE owns a 61-acre strip of waterfront land in unincorporated Snohomish County known as “Point Wells.” For approximately 100 years, the property has been used for petroleum storage and other industrial purposes. Prior to 2009, Snohomish County designated the area “Urban Industrial.”</p>

BSRE wants to redevelop the property by adding over 3,000 housing units and over 100,000 square feet of commercial and retail space. The petitioners — Town of Woodway (Woodway) and Save Richmond Beach Inc. (Richmond Beach) — oppose the project. They fear that the area lacks the infrastructure needed to support an urban center, namely sufficient roads and public transit. These nearby communities do not want to “bear the burden of providing urban services to the site.” Pet. for Discr. Review (Richmond Beach) at 3.</p>

First, in 2009, the county adopted two ordinances amending its comprehensive plan to allow the redesignation of Point Wells from “Urban Industrial” to “Urban Center.” Second, in 2010, it adopted two ordinances amending its building regulations to accommodate Point Wells as an Urban Center. The county prepared a draft supplemental environmental impact statement (EIS), took comments, and finalized the EIS for the comprehensive plan amendments in 2009. It made a determination of <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>nonsignificance for the latter two ordinances (i.e., the development regulations) based on the 2009 EIS. Woodway and Richmond Beach petitioned the growth management hearings board (growth board) to review the four ordinances. A hearing took place before the growth board on March 2, 2011.</p>
    <p id="b235-3" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[97,703,1251,433]]]'>¶6 Before the growth board issued its final order, BSRE filed two permit applications to redevelop Point Wells. It filed the first permit application on February 14, 2011, two weeks before the hearing before the growth board. BSRE filed the second permit application on March 4, 2011, two days after the hearing before the growth board. The county published notices of both permits shortly after they were filed. The notices stated that the applications were complete.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[95,1161,1252,762]]]'>¶7 On April 25, 2011, the growth board issued its final order. It found that all four ordinances were noncompliant with SEPA. The growth board found that the county’s EIS was faulty because it did not consider multiple alternatives to the Urban Center designation — the only alternative it considered was no change at all. The growth board found that the development regulations were noncompliant because they relied on the same faulty EIS as the comprehensive plan amendments. The growth board remanded the four ordinances with instructions to cure them of their SEPA flaws. The growth board also invalidated the comprehensive plan amendments — but not the development regulations — finding that their continued validity would substantially interfere with the goals of the GMA.</p>

The petitioners also asked for an injunction against the county to stop it from processing BSRE’s permits. The parties moved for summary judgment, and the court found for the petitioners. The court ruled that BSRE’s rights did not vest to the ordi<a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>nances later found to be noncompliant with SEPA, and it enjoined the county from processing their permits until the county complied with the growth board’s order of remand.</p>

The doctrine operates to protect citizens and developers from the government changing the conditions and requirements that existed and were relied on when a completed building permit or development proposal was submitted. In other words, under the doctrine, except under limited circumstances, the government could not change the rules of the game after it had already been played. But no laws changed that affected the development in this case. It was illegal under the Growth Management Act (GMA), chapter 36.70A RCW, and the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), chapter 43.21C RCW, at all times. The majority’s decision erroneously creates a troubling erosion of the requirements under the GMA and, more disturbing, SEPA.</p>

The GMA controls the development of land and guides a county’s options in planning for growth, development, and expansion. Similarly, SEPA exists to condition development in order to protect our environment and minimize the envi<a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>ronmental impact caused by development. The majority embraces a radical departure from our cases and uses the vested rights doctrine as a sword to disregard the mandates of both the GMA and SEPA. The record in this case establishes that both the county and developer likely knew their plan would not survive a challenge unless the anticipated Growth Management Hearings Board’s (Board) decision to invalidate their proposal could be cleverly circumvented. No principle of fundamental fairness applies where the actions of the county and developer are designed to circumvent the existing requirements of the GMA and SEPA.

Despite the fact that adequate urban services including transit, water, sewer, police, fire, emergency, and trash collection for Point Wells were neither available nor clearly planned, as noted by the Board, BSRE had argued that its promise to fund the building of a transit center, on-site police and fire stations, and a commuter rail station was the equivalent of the actual governmental commitment required by the GMA. The Board also rejected this argument, noting that “ ‘Trust Us’ is not a GMA Plan.” CP at 137. As a result, the Board invalidated the County’s comprehensive plan amendments. CP at 166.</p>

The Board found the FSEIS inadequate because there were other land use designations the County could have considered that would have been less dense, generated fewer vehicle trips, and been less of a strain on public facilities and services. CP at 148. As a result, the Board held that all four ordinances did not comply with SEPA and remanded them back to the County to take legislative action to comply with SEPA. CP at 166-67.</p>

To the majority, BSRE would have a vested right regardless of whether it plans to build 3,000 or 30,000 new housing units in Point Wells. This is not the situation envisioned by the vested rights doctrine or what the statute provides.</p>

There was not even a threat of fluctuating legislation during this time, as Snohomish County was in fact defending to the Board the very legislation <em>requested </em>by BSRE and under which BSRE claims its development rights vested. No case exists in which this court has held that a developer has a vested right to build under invalid, site-specific legislation that it specifically requested and subsequently defended on appeal and of which it is the sole beneficiary.</p>

    <p id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[219,744,1250,646]]]'>This provision must be read consistent with the vested rights doctrine and not, as the majority reasons, as an independent, freestanding vesting provision. The statute is written in the past tense: invalidity does not apply to applications for a project <em>that vested. </em>It does not create rights. Rather, it protects only rights that already existed by way of vesting and assumes a separate mechanism by which those rights are created in the first place, namely our vested rights doctrine. Because BSRE should not have an illegal development right under our vested rights doctrine, it cannot use RCW 36.70A.302(2) as a shield to protect its illegal use.</p>

As noted by the Board, however, the area in fact lacks all of the necessary infrastructure to support an urban center. Point Wells lies on the County’s southern border and is not accessible from anywhere within its own boundaries. The task of providing transportation, utilities, and police and fire protection, to name a few, in fact fully burdens King County; the city of Shoreline; and a narrow, inadequate residential road. Such an absurd result cannot be what the vested rights doctrine was intended to protect.</p>

The GMA and SEPA <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>should be read in harmony and given effect, and not, as the majority holds, written out of existence.

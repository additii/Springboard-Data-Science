Before the evaluation period ended, Anderson voluntarily sought civil commitment. Anderson remained at WSH as a voluntary patient for approximately 10 years. In 1998, Anderson requested to <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>be transferred to a less restrictive area of WSH. This less restrictive area was intended for residents who “were managing their own lives and had the wherewithal to take care of themselves,” and residents who were transferred to the less restrictive area were often later released into the community. 9 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (May 9, 2013) at 690. However, the psychosexual evaluator determined that Anderson “was really not controlling his sexual impulses to the degree that he claimed he had been,” and recommended against transferring him to the less restrictive area. <em>Id. </em>at 699.</p>

RCW 71.09.025(1)(a)(ii), .030(1)(b).

For instance, RCW 71.09.030(2) lists the entities that are authorized to file SVP petitions. <em>Martin, </em>163 Wn.2d at 516. Authorized entities include the prosecuting attorney of any county where “[t]he person has been charged or convicted with a sexually violent offense” or “[a] recent overt act occurred.” RCW 71.09.030(2)(a)(i)-(ii). Conspicuously absent is any mention of the prosecuting attorney of a county where the person has been found to have committed a sexually violent offense as a juvenile. Similarly, RCW 71.09.020(18) defines an SVP in part as “any person who has been convicted of or charged with a crime of sexual violence.” Nowhere does this definition mention a person found to have committed a sexually violent offense as a juvenile. The argument that juvenile adjudications cannot be convictions for purposes of chapter 71.09 RCW is plainly inconsistent with both of these provisions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The dissent’s interpretation also leaves some baffling holes in the SVP statutory scheme. For example, if a juvenile adjudication is not a conviction for the purposes of chapter 71.09 RCW, then no one with a former juvenile adjudication for a sexually violent offense—whether in custody or not—could meet the definition of an SVP found in RCW 71.09.020(18). While that certainly could be a reasonable policy choice, it cannot have been what was actually intended. If it were, surely the legislature would not have explicitly authorized an SVP petition to be filed against a person “found to have committed a sexually violent offense as a juvenile.” RCW 71.09.030(1)(b). At the very least, reconciling this conflict would require precisely the type of judicial rewriting that the dissent purportedly so abhors. <em>See </em>dissent at 95.</p>

Before the age of 18, Anderson committed numerous sexual offenses. He manipulated a younger child into performing oral sex on him multiple times. He lured a five-year-old into a secluded area with the intention of raping her. He had a sexual encounter that clearly became nonconsensual when the other child told Anderson to stop and he refused. He did not realize that this was rape until told so years later, and as recently as 2011, he still described that encounter as “mutual.” CP at 475. Anderson also raped a two-year-old whom he was babysitting on about a dozen separate occasions. When Anderson was 17, he raped a different two-year-old, resulting in a juvenile adjudication for first degree statutory rape.</p>

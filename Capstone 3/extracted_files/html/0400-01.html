We did not set out the testimony in detail, as we found it unnecessary to do so. Upon the remand of the cause there was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff in the action, from which is this appeal.</p>

The witness did not remember what month’s dues the receipt covered, but she testified that she read it and knew the receipt covered dues to the order which her husband had paid.</p>
    <p id="b428-3" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[293,628,1201,351]]]'>Objection was made to the admission of secondary evidence in regard to this receipt and its contents, but plaintiff testified that it was not in her possession, but had been given by her to an attorney who offered to collect the certificate for her. This attorney denied that he had the receipt or that he had ever seen it, and this conflict made a question for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[291,997,1203,813]]]'>It might be said that the testimony of the plaintiff is of itself too indefinite and uncertain to support a finding that there was a second payment of dues. In other words, that she did not sufficiently prove the contents of this lost receipt to warrant the submission of the question whether there was a payment of dues which it covered. But we think the testimony does raise this issue when the testimony of plaintiff is considered in connection with that of her attorney. Her attorney testified that the plaintiff turned over to him certain papers belonging to her husband, one of these being a notice or postal card dated August 6, 1919,. which had been sent out by the collecting officer of the order designated as the financier, and that, after looking over these papers, the attorney went to the office of the financier to inquire if a payment had been made pursuant to this notice.</p>
    <p id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.6",428,[291,1825,1203,563]],["BL_429.1",429,[230,386,1202,203]]]'>Objection to the introduction of this testimony was made upon two grounds; first, that the card itself, was the best evidence, and second, for the reason that it made no difference whether the card .was sent or not, as it did not constitute a waiver of the forfeiture resulting from the nonpayment of dues, as, under the rules of the order, one failing to pay dues was automatically suspended. The court overruled the objection made, and in doing so said: “It might show whether he was suspended or not; that might be a circumstance, and I will let it go to the jury for that purpose; of course, on the question of <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>the card being the best evidence, yon -will have to show some reason why it is not produced.” This witness then proceeded to testify what he did after reading this notice, and his testimony will be set out.</p>
    <p id="b429-3" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[231,600,1202,450]]]'>The objection to the admission of testimony in regard to finding the card may be disposed of by saying that the card appears to have no substantial bearing on the case. It appears to have been a notice of delinquency, and it is not contended that any dues were paid after its receipt, and no contention was made that it operated to waive the forfeiture because of the nonpayment of dues if the insured was in fact delinquent in the payment of dues.</p>
    <p id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[233,1071,1204,1023]]]'>The delivery of this card to the attorney furnished the occasion for his visit to the financier of the order, and the attorney testified that he presented this notice and asked to be allowed to examine the records of the order in which the account was kept of dues which had been paid. This privilege was accorded the attorney, and he testified that the record at that time showed a payment of dues under date of May 30, and also under date of June 30. This is vigorously denied by the financier of the order, and the record was submitted to the jury and examined by the jurors with the aid of a microscope. This original record has been submitted to us, under stipulation of counsel, and, while we do not feel called upon to review the jury’s finding on this question of fact, we do announce our conclusion that the appearance of the record is not such as to afford no corroboration of the testimony of plaintiff’s attorney. The record does present a soiled appearance, but whether this is from an erasure having been made or from the frequent examination to which it has been subjected we do not decide.</p>

Lewellen was a member in good standing of the defendant society at the time that the certificate was issued, and that condition would be presumed to continue, unless the defendant has shown, by a preponderance of’the evidence, that he forfeited his membership by the nonpayment of dues.”</p>

Frederick Hardtke was charged with two counts of second <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>degree rape, one count of second degree assault, two counts of fourth degree assault, and malicious mischief. All were alleged to be acts of domestic violence that took place while Hardtke claimed he was blacked out from alcohol abuse. At arraignment, the trial court imposed conditions of release, including that Hardtke not consume alcohol. To ensure his compliance with this condition, in addition to a performance bond Hardtke was required to wear an electronic alcohol monitoring bracelet while awaiting trial. Hardtke objected multiple times to paying for the cost of the bracelet, but he wore the bracelet as a condition of his release. Hardtke eventually pleaded guilty to amended charges, and as part of his sentence, he was ordered to reimburse the county for the cost of the alcohol monitoring. He appealed, challenging only the imposition of this cost. The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>

Because he was unable to obtain a performance bond for that amount, Hardtke moved to modify the conditions of his release, asking that the bond amount be reduced. He acknowledged that his alcohol use was a safety concern and argued that wearing a transder-mal alcohol detection (TAD) bracelet would be a less restrictive alternative to the $15,000 bond. The court agreed to modify the release conditions if Hardtke wore a TAD <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>bracelet and posted a $3,000 bond.

In response to these violations, Hardtke forfeited the $3,000 bond and the court imposed a new, higher bond. Hardtke eventually pleaded guilty to amended charges. As part of the sentence, the State recommended that Hardtke reimburse San Juan County for the cost of the TAD monitoring. Hardtke renewed his objection to paying for the monitoring at his sentencing hearing, but he signed the plea agreement. The court imposed a sentence of 24 months and further imposed the cost of the TAD monitoring ($3,972) in the judgment and sentence as “restitution” to San Juan County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

What the Court of Appeals described are <em>conditions </em>of release that may — or may not— come with collateral financial obligations. In the case of a bond, for example, the court orders as a condition of release that the defendant post a bond. The defendant then arranges with a third party (e.g., a bail bond company) to purchase the bond. How the bond is paid for, and at what fee, is entirely between the defendant and the bonding company; the court itself is not involved. The important <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>distinction in the bond example is that the court imposes a condition and it is up to the defendant to fulfill any financial obligation to a third party that may come with that condition.</p>
    <p id="b535-4" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[101,570,1253,765]]]'>¶11 But those are not the facts of this case. Here, the record discloses that Hardtke obtained the TAD bracelet without being contemporaneously financially responsible for it (as he was with the performance bond he acquired). Rather, the record and briefs of the parties show that the county paid or was responsible for the costs of the TAD monitoring and is seeking repayment from Hardtke by way of court-ordered costs. Hardtke himself did not arrange for the TAD monitoring and did not agree to pay a third-party company for the service. On the record before us, the sentencing court imposed a <em>cost </em>on Hardtke for pretrial electronic alcohol monitoring in order to ensure compliance with the release condition that he not consume alcohol. We find no support for the State’s argument under CrR 3.2.</p>

The costs for administering “pretrial supervision” may be imposed on a nonconvicted defendant but may not exceed $150. RCW 10.01.160(2).

In a different context, the Court of Appeals has analyzed whether psychological evaluations to determine competency to stand trial were deemed to be “expenses specially incurred.” Relying on Oregon cases that interpreted a similar statute<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> on which RCW 10.01.160 was based, the court concluded that the term “expenses specially incurred” refers to costs that “are not a public expenditure made ‘irrespective of specific violations of law.’ ” <em>Utter v.

TAD monitoring operates like other monitoring devices, such as GPS (global positioning system) monitoring.

This monitoring is functionally analogous to requiring a defendant awaiting trial to physically check in with the court or county probation officer to demonstrate that pretrial release conditions have been complied with.

The college received 152 applications meeting the minimum qualifications, which were a master’s degree in English, rhetoric and composition, or professional-technical writing, and teaching experience. From these applicants, the screening committee interviewed 13 candidates who gave teaching demonstrations. The screening committee then chose four candidates to refer to the president and vice president of instruction.</p>

The college also directs the court’s attention to the steering committee’s observation that Scrivener lost her place at one point during her teaching demonstration, which could have caused some confusion in a class. Other weaknesses were that she could have turned to face her audience more when she was writing on the board and that “[w]hile [her] exuberance and passion were seen by the committee as positive, there could be an off-putting reaction by some passive students because of such an up-front style.” Interim Vice President Thornburg attests that age was not discussed during the consideration of the candidates and that she and President Branch agreed that Scrivener was ranked last among the finalists.</p>

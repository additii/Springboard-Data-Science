The indictment was returned under § 7437. of Crawford <em>&amp; </em>Moses’ Digest, which reads as follows: “It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to have in its.possession an automobile, automobile tires or gasoline engine, the motor and serial number of.-which- .have been mutilated to the extent that same cannot be read.. Where any automobile, automobile tires, or gasoline engine has been stolen and recovered, and serial numbers found mutilated, the court where such case may be tried shall have power ta authorize the rightful owner of such automobile tires or* accessories to continue the use of same. The court shall also direct that the owner of such car have the <a id="p788" href="#p788" data-label="788" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*788</a>original serial numbers restenciled on the engine or motor car. ’ ’</p>
    <p id="b804-5" data-blocks='[["BL_804.5",804,[284,466,1201,1119]]]'>The section of the statute in question was passed in exercise of the police power of the State for the protection of the public. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Fernow, </em><a href="/ill/286/0627-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="286 Ill. 627" data-case-ids="4935051" data-case-paths="/ill/286/0627-01">286 Ill. 627</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20N.E.%20155" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="122 N.E. 155">122 N. E. 155</a>, the Supreme Court of Illinois, in giving the reason for the passage of acts of this sort, said“The purpose of the act is to prevent the defacing, covering, or destruction of the manufacturer’s serial number or distinguishing mark, so as to preserve the identity of motor vehicles and thereby protect the public against violations of law. The motor vehicle has become the most common and efficient agency f.or the commission of crime and the chief instrumentality employed by criminals to avoid detection and escape punishment, and one of the methods employed is to destroy the evidence of identity. Motor vehicles have also become very frequent subjects of larceny, and the removal or change of the serial number is a convenient method for preventing identification and recovery. One committing a crime, even the most serious, and escaping in an automobile, would be more difficult of apprehension if the serial number or identification mark should be removed. The section is a legitimate and proper exercise of the police power. ’ ’</p>

In discussing this phase of the case, the court said: “In the exercise of the police power for the protection of the public, the performance of a specific act may constitute the crime, regardless of either knowledge or intent, both of which are immaterial on the question of guilt. For the effective protection of the public, the burden is placed upon the individual of ascertaining at his peril whether his act is prohibited by criminal statute. The law in that regard has most frequently arisen in police regulations of the liquor traffic, but it has been applied in precisely the same way in other cases coming within the same rule and reason, such as a sale of imitation' butter, a sale of <a id="p789" href="#p789" data-label="789" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*789</a>milk below a prescribed quality, tbe obstruction of a public highway by a railroad corporation for longer than a specified time, the admission of a minor to a pool-room, driving an unregistered automobile, killing for sale an animal under a designated age, carriage by an express company for transportation beyond the State line of fish or game, and in prosecutions for bigamy. ’ ’ Several decisions are cited, and the case has been followed in this court in <em>Ogburn </em>v. State, <a href="/ark/168/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="168 Ark. 396" data-case-ids="8722295" data-case-paths="/ark/168/0396-01">168 Ark. 396</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=270%20S.W.%20945" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="270 S.W. 945">270 S.

    <p id="b805-3" data-blocks='[["BL_805.4",805,[212,937,1209,758]]]'>The next assignment of error relates to the admission of evidence. The defendant testified as a witness in his own behalf, and said that he bought the.casings in question from a young man who was not known to Mm, and that he paid ten dollars for them. A note was found in a bottle upon a house-roof, fifteen or sixteen feet from the cell in the jail where the defendant was confined after being arrested. The note was not signed, .and reads as follows: “'Say Gordon if King or any of them ask you about them casings tell them you don’t no who the man was and tell Red to do the same, for they said they aimed to make him make a sworn statement about it. Tell Mm to stay away from them if he man. If you all don’t do that it will sure mess me up, for we have done, told the court that we didn’t no who the other man was.”</p>

The defendant was a witness in his own behalf, and, over the objection of his counsel, the prosecuting attomey was allowed to ask the defendant, on cross-examination, if he had not signed, as’ his testimony before the grand jury, the following: “I bought these casings from a man claiming to live near New Boston. Red Henderson, Verme Norton, J. T. Hall.” The defendant admitted that he had signed the writing, and the court allowed it to be introduced in evidence for the purpose of comparing it with the unsigned letter copied above, which the prosecuting attorney claimed was in the defendant’s handwriting. It is claimed by counsel for the defendant that the signature to his testimony before the grand jury was <a id="p790" href="#p790" data-label="790" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*790</a>not a paper in the case, and that a comparison with a writing- not already in the case, bnt which is proved for the purpose of such comparison is not admissible, under <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Jones, </em><a href="/ark/32/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="32 Ark. 337" data-case-ids="1877185" data-case-paths="/ark/32/0337-01">32 Ark. 337</a>.</p>

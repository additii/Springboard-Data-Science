Johnson, deceased, and quashing the judgment of the probate court of said county, entered on January 12, 1925, of record in book N, at page 432, wherein appellee was contestant and appellant was contestee.</p>

I told Arby to watch the mail <a id="p923" href="#p923" data-label="923" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*923</a>box and send it to me, for I wanted you to have it.

    <p id="b941-6" data-blocks='[["BL_941.6",941,[149,608,1201,651]]]'>There is nothing in the writing evidencing an intent on the part of the writer to bequeath by, through or under the instrument his war risk insurance policy to his wife, the appellant herein. The writing must itself evidence a present purpose of declaring a bequest before it can be characterized as a will. If it merely evidences an intention to make such a provision in the future, then such instrument cannot be interpreted as a will. <em>Cartwright </em>v.

    <p id="b941-8" data-blocks='[["BL_941.8",941,[148,1427,1202,403]]]'>The language in the present case does not pretend to declare a present bequest of the writer’s war risk insurance policy, but is merely a message to the effect that the writer intends at a future date to change the beneficiary in his policy from appellee, his sister, to appellant, his wife, because it was his will and wish for her to have it. He did not attempt to give it to her in the letter or to use the letter as a means of bequeathing it to her.</p>

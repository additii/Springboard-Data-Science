    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[207,479,1201,558]]]'>Evidence was taken on this motion. The clerk of the Hot Spring Circuit Court was called as a witness, and testified that he had a list of the petit jurors who served at the present term of court, and that Tom Belote had been serving as a special petit juror; had served for three days; that he had only served as juror at the present term of court in one case; that Belote was summoned as a special juror, and is not on the regular panel. He was summoned late Wednesday afternoon. The court overruled appellant’s motion to quash the panel, and exceptions were saved. .</p>
    <p id="b109-6" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[206,1045,1203,1169]]]'>The evidence introduced by appellees tended to show that the parties were hauling dirt from the Mal-vern Brick &amp; Tile Company, and it was necessary to cross the railroad tracks of appellant at the main street crossing. They were in a Chevrolet truck and were going north at about 4:30 p. m., and were running between 10 and 15 miles per hour; that they shut off for the crossing, and put on the brakes, and brought the truck to almost a complete stop, and saw the southbound passenger train taking water, and the engine was 12 or 15 feet from the crossing. They saw the engine standing and saw the fireman on the back of the tender; noticed him reaching over to get the water nozzle. The bell was not ringing, but the flagman was standing about in line with the right sidewalk; was on the opposite side of the track from the truck, and was hacking on the telephone post with his flagstick and not looking in the direction of the truck. No signals were given by the operators of the train before starting up, and when the truck was about 30 feet from the track the occupants noticed the train beginning to move. The driver of the truck put on his brakes, and swerved to the right to keep from striking the train. The truck hit the curb and turned over.</p>

    <p id="b110-3" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[303,586,1203,660]]]'>Witnesses then described the injuries received, and physicians were introduced who testified as to the injuries. The truck was going down a pretty steep grade, and the driver was using his brakes coming down the street. The driver was looking ahead and saw the signal <em>lights at </em>the crossing’, and knew there was danger. He knew that the crossing was dangerous, but he saw the engine standing and saw the flagman there, and he did not give them any signal. The truck was stopped some distance from the track, but they saw the engine was not moving, saw the fireman on top of the tender, and, as no warning was given, either by the trainmen or flagman, they thought it was safe to cross the track.</p>
    <p id="b110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[302,1251,1205,712]]]'>The evidence on the part of the appellant tended to show that the engineer stopped the engine even with the water spout, and that the front of the engine was about the edge of the sidewalk; that there was an automatic bell ringing when they came into the station. The employees in charge of the train saw the truck coming down the street, and thought nothing of it until it got within about 20 feet of the train; that the engine was at that time moving, the engineer having received a signal from the fireman. The bell was ringing, and the flagman was in the middle of the crossing, and when the train came in, the flagman was in the middle of the street with his stop sign up. There was nothing to prevent the driver of the truck from seeing the train.</p>

      <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>Appellant’s first contention is that the court erred in overruling its motion to quash the panel of petit jurors, and it says that Belote had served and sat as a juror in other cases with the jury that tried his case; that he had associated daily with the jurors, and that this influenced other jurors may be seen because in the Belote caso, the verdict was unanimous, and in the Kelly and Watt cases it was not unanimous. The Belote case, however, was for damages to his car, and the other cases were for personal injuries. The jury might very well agree unanimously as to the value of the car, and they might not all agree as to the amount appellees were entitled to recover for personal injuries.</p>
    <p id="b111-5" data-blocks='[["BL_111.4",111,[209,1050,1200,241]]]'>Appellant quotes from 35 C. J. 333 as follows: ‘‘Where a litigant serves on a jury at a term at which he has a case to be tried by a jury, all of the other jurors with whom he has been serving are incompetent to sit in the trial of his case.”</p>
    <p id="b111-6" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[207,1306,1202,658]]]'>Appellant’s attorney doubtless thought, when he filed his motion to quash, that Belote was a member of the regular panel. The evidence, however, shows that he was summoned as a special juror and served in one ease. The record is silent as to whether he was summoned for the purpose of serving in that case alone. It does show however that he was not on the regular panel, and that he served in but one case, and it fails to show any association at all with the other members of the panel, and there is no evidence in the record tending to show that any juror who tried this case had associated with Belote at all, or even knew that he had been subpoenaed as a special juror and served in one case.</p>
    <p id="b111-7" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[207,1971,1201,401]]]'>Appellant also calls attention to note one in volume 35 of C. J. 333, but there is nothing in the evidence in this case tending to show any association or unfair advantage or that any of the jurors who served in this case had at any time served with Belote. It would certainly not disqualify the panel because 'Belote served in one case, when there is not any evidence tending to show that he served with any of the jurors in his case.</p>

      <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>Appellant next contends that the court erred in sending the instructions into the jury room after the jury had deliberated some time, with the word “pltf.” in pencil at the left hand top corner of plaintiff’s instruction No. 2, and the word “This” on plaintiff’s instructions Nos. 4, 6, 8 and 12.</p>
    <p id="b112-5" data-blocks='[["BL_112.4",112,[318,703,1205,451]]]'>It appears that the penciled notations on the margin of the instructions were put there during the argument of counsel with no intention or expectation that the jury would see them. The notations were put there for the convenience of the attorney in making his argument, and no one seemed to think about it, and the attention of the court was not called to it. If the court’s attention had been called to it, or there had been any request to do so, he would doubtless have erased the marks.</p>
    <p id="b112-6" data-blocks='[["BL_112.5",112,[317,1177,1203,302]]]'>Whether appellant’s attorney knew about the marks being there before the instructions were given to the jury is not shown by the evidence. He probably did not know of it, but there is no evidence in the record tending’ to show that they were noticed by the jury or influenced the jurors in any way.</p>
    <p id="b112-7" data-blocks='[["BL_112.6",112,[318,1493,1201,146]]]'>It is next contended that there is no liability under the law and evidence in this case, and that the trial court should have directed a verdict in favor of appellant.</p>

If the appellant was guilty of negligence in the operation of the train at the time, and that negligence injured the appellees, while they were in the exercise of ordinary care, this would be damage done and caused by the running of trains.

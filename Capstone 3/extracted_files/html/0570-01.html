The complaint upon which the order sought to be quashed was made alleges the existence of the district and states the termini of the road to be improved. Its route is alleged to be across the lands of petitioner, and it is further alleged that its construction will require an acre of his land. We must therefore presume, in a proceSding of this character, that, by appropriate and necessary orders, the county court has established the road which the improvement district is proposing to improve.

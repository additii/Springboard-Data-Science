The case was tried in the circuit court upon the following agreed statement of facts:</p>
    <p id="b868-5" data-blocks='[["BL_868.5",868,[317,815,1199,808]]]'>“Whereas, Dan Kincannon, a resident of the Osceola District of Mississippi County, Arkansas, has heretofore been arrested upon a charge of violating the game and fish law of the State of Arkansas; and whereas the isaid Dan Kincannon has been fishing for the market with a hoop-net upon the waters of the Mississippi River without license; and whereas he was convicted of this crime in the justice of the peace court before Gr. L. Waddell, a .justice of the peace for Monroe Township, Mississippi County, Arkansas; and whereas this case is before this court upon appeal; it is therefore agreed between the parties hereto that the defendant, Dan Kin-cannon, has been fishing upon the waters of the Mississippi River for market purposes, and has been using a hoop-net, and has not procured a license as set out in § 4775 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest.”</p>
    <p id="b868-6" data-blocks='[["BL_868.6",868,[316,1649,1199,706]]]'>The trial court took the view that § 4775 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest was repealed by act No. 423 of the Acts of the General Assembly of 1923, and that, after the repeal, it was not necessary for a person fishing upon the waters of the State for market with a hoop-net or nets to have a license. The interpretation of the later act by the trial court was incorrect. Section 1 of the later act, standing alone, would have the effect of repealing § 4775 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, but, when read in connection with the other sections of the act, it is manifest that the Legislature only intended to repeal § 4775 of Crawford <em>&amp; </em>Moses’ Digest so far as it related to Marion County. Section 4 of the act limits all other provisions of the act to Marion County only.</p>

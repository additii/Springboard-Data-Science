Upon an examination of the cases cited, we find those most nearly sustaining the contention <a id="p912" href="#p912" data-label="912" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*912</a>are <em>Bew </em>v. <em>Travelers’ Ins. Co.; Travelers’ Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Peek, </em>and <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Bus. Men’s Acc. Co., supra. </em>In the first mentioned case the applicable clause is as follows: “The insurance hereunder shall not cover * * * injuries, fatal or non-fatal, sustained by the insured while participating in, or in consequence of having participated in, aeronautics.” The insured was killed while a passenger in an airplane. After quoting the definition of the word “aeronautics” given by the Ency. Britt, “aeronautics is the art or practice of sailing in, or navigating, the air,” the court held that there was nothing in the definition to confine it to- those active in piloting air vessels and to exclude those who are inactive users thereof. The court also quoted from the Standard Dictionary the definition of the word “participate” as meaning, “to receive or have a part or share of; to partake of; experience in common with others; to have or enjoy a part or share in common with others; partake; as to participate in a discussion; to take a part in; as to participate in joys or sorrows.” Prom these definitions it was the conclusion of the court that one who is a passenger in an aeroplane partakes of the pleasure and benefits of the art or practice of sailing in the air and thereby participates in aeronautics. In reaching* this conclusion, the court, however, appears to have given no effect to one of the definitions, <em>supra, vis, </em>“to take part in.”</p>

Words and phrases used in insurance policies should be construed by their meaning as used in the ordinary speech of the people and not as understood by scholars.</p>

He likely would not think that by the question was meant to learn if he had, or intended merely “to have, enjoy, or share in common with others ’ ’ the privilege of being transported as a passenger on the lines of railway companies.</p>

      <a id="p914" href="#p914" data-label="914" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*914</a>It is interesting, however, to note that in these cases and others which discover a distinction between “engaged in” and “participate in,” the courts, when they abandon the role of the “precisian” and discuss the case in the language of the ordinary person, they sometimes use the words “engaged” and “participate” or “participation” as conveying a similar idea. In the case of <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., supra, </em>in discussing the word “engaged” the court said: “It gives the impression of participation as an occupation.” In <em>Benefit Ass’n </em>v. <em>Hayden, supra, </em>the court found for the beneficiary, saying: “The proper construction of those words (engaged in) is that actual employment or participation was contemplated and not merely riding as a passenger.” This case followed the case of <em>Benham </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em><a href="/ark/140/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="140 Ark. 612" data-case-ids="1594393" data-case-paths="/ark/140/0612-01">140 Ark. 612</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=217%20S.W.%20462" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="217 S.W. 462">217 S.

    <p id="b932-5" data-blocks='[["BL_932.4",932,[306,1536,1202,898]]]'>As defined by the leading lexicographers, “aviation” is a more exact and specific term than “aeronautics” and means “the art or science of locomotion by means of aeroplanes.” Webster. It might appear that if aviation is the science of locomotion by aeroplane and the word “participate” means “to take part in,” the phrase “participate in aviation” would connote an active share in its management; as, where a person of <em>First Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Phoenix, supra, </em>where he owned the plane and had authority to, and did, direct the pilot as to when he should make the flight. It would seem that this interpretation of the phrase “participate in aviation” is not wholly unjustified. We pass this question, however, without deciding it because it is unnecessary to do so under the language of the exemption clause in the contract before us which is dissimilar to that of any of the cases denying the right to recover relied on by learned counsel.</p>

He owned the plane, employed a pilot to operate it, determined whether weather conditions would permit of the flight and when it should be made.

While the operation of gliders was not his regular business, it was an avocation in which he frequently indulged. He was killed on October 23, 1931, and had flown a glider during the two preceding years approximately 203 times.

It is used indiscriminately as a noun and as an adjective, just as the word “submarine.” The use of the word “either” after “or” is frequently implied (see Webster’s Dict.) and it is not an unreasonable construction to say that “operations” is limited by both aviation and submarine participation. At least, this is an interpretation which the ordinary person, not skilled in the niceties of grammatical construction, might give to it.

It was the contention of the plaintiff that the exception intended to apply only to an accidental death occurring while engaged in aviation in time of war. The court found this construction a reasonable one when the punctuation employed was considered.

Pashniak, the purchaser of two condominiums at a foreclosure sale, now wants to withdraw his bids. The judgment creditor, Sixty-01 Association of Apartment Owners, wants to confirm the sales. RCW 6.21.110 governs the confirmation of sales of real estate. RCW 6.21.110(2) states, “The judgment creditor or successful purchaser at the sheriff’s sale is entitled to an order confirming the sale.” The issue is whether a successful purchaser has a right to withdraw his or her bid prior to confirmation or if a judgment creditor is entitled to confirmation of the sale absent substantial irregularities, even if the purchaser no longer wishes to purchase the property. We hold that a third party purchaser does not have a unilateral right to withdraw a successful bid before confirmation. Either the purchaser or the judgment creditor can move for confirmation, and the sale should be confirmed by the court unless a debtor or a nondefaulting party who received notice proves there were substantial irregularities in the proceedings. Further, while a court may invalidate a sale based on equitable considerations, this situation does not merit such a remedy. We affirm the Court of Appeals and confirm both sales.</p>

Each property was encumbered by a mortgage from Bank of America, evidenced by deeds of trust recorded in King County. Sixty-01 operates the complex under a declaration of condominium that was filed and recorded in King County. Under RCW 64.32.200(2) and section 19.1 of the declaration, Sixty-01 has a continuing statutory lien against the units that may be foreclosed on to secure payment of assessments levied by the Sixty-01 board of directors. The declaration provides that Sixty-Ol’s lien is subordinate to any recorded deeds of trust, whenever recorded.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The complaints did not name Bank of America or any deed of trust holder as defendants, nor did the complaints seek to extinguish any deeds of trust encumbering the units. In November 2011, the trial court entered default judgments and decrees of foreclosure against both Parsons and Mallarino. The judgments stated that Sixty-Ol’s lien was superior to any other lien or interest described in the complaint “arising subsequent to the recording of [SixtyOl’s] Lis Pendens in this action on May 19th, 2010.” Mallarino Clerk’s Papers (M-CP) at 125.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It further stated that all “right, title, claim, lien, estate or interest of the <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>Foreclosed Defendants, each and all of them, and of all persons claiming by, through, or under them, in and to the Property or any part thereof is inferior and subordinate to [Sixty-0 l’s] lien and is hereby foreclosed.” <em>Id. </em>at 126.</p>

After receiving the notice, Bank of America sought extra assurances that its interest would not be affected by the foreclosure sale, so Bank of America and Sixty-01 entered into stipulations regarding Bank of America’s rights in each of the properties for sale.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The stipulations provided that Bank of America was not a defendant in the foreclosure action and did not have any judgment against it, that the properties were encumbered by Bank of America’s deeds of trust recorded in 2006 and 2007 and the liens were superior and senior to Sixty-0 l’s interests, and that the purchasers at the sheriff’s sales would take any interest in the properties subject to any valid interest of Bank of America. None of these stipulations changed or altered the rights of the parties; they simply reiterated Bank of America’s lienholder status in light of the condominium association’s foreclosure. The stipulations were filed with the court on March 7, 2012 (Parsons) and the afternoon of March 8, 2012 (Mallarino).</p>

Pashniak bought the units at the sheriff’s sales, submitting high bids of about $16,200 for the Parsons property and $35,400 for the Mallarino property. Pashniak did not examine the court files or county records before he submitted his bids. On March 16, 2012, the King County Superior Court judgment clerk mailed the notices of return of the sheriff’s sale on real property. On March 19, <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>2012, after Pashniak learned that the properties were encumbered by Bank of America’s interests, he asked Sixty-01 to allow him to withdraw his bid, stating that if he had known the properties were encumbered, he would not have bid on them.</p>
    <p id="b363-3" data-blocks='[["BL_363.4",363,[114,660,1254,586]]]'>¶6 On March 22, 2012, Pashniak, acting pro se, sent a notice of appearance and an objection to the confirmation of the sale of the Parsons property, stating that he found the order of sale and complaint for foreclosure confusing as to whether the sheriff’s sale was free and clear of other indebtedness. On June 6, 2012, Sixty-01 moved to confirm the Parsons sale. On June 20, 2012, the King County Superior Court confirmed the sale, noting Pashniak’s objection to confirmation but finding that he failed to allege any substantial irregularities in the proceedings concerning the sale, which was in all respects legally and fairly conducted.</p>

On July 12, 2012, Pashniak, then represented by counsel, filed a second objection to this confirmation and moved to vacate the sale. The court noted that while the stipulations that Bank of America and Sixty-01 had filed would have been available to any citizen to review at the clerk’s office when it was open, they would not have been viewable in the electronic court record for 24 to 48 hours after filing. Exercising its equitable authority, the court found that a reasonable <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>citizen who bought property at sheriff’s sales would not have had inquiry notice of Bank of America’s lien.

    <p id="b364-3" data-blocks='[["BL_364.4",364,[205,597,1254,800]]]'>¶8 Sixty-01 appealed in the Mallarino sale, and Pashniak appealed in the Parsons sale.

The Court of Appeals held that unless there are irregularities in the proceedings, the trial court is required to confirm the sale, regardless of any equitable considerations. Bank of America’s deed of trust, filed long before the foreclosures, provided notice of Bank of America’s priority interest, and thus the late-filed stipulations did not create an irregularity or an inequity.

A plain reading of RCW 6.21.110(2) refutes this argument. RCW 6.21.110(2) reads, “The judgment creditor or successful purchaser at the sheriff’s sale is entitled to an order confirming the sale.” The plain language of this statute entitles a creditor or a purchaser to confirmation unless there is a timely objection by an appropriate individual and proof of substantial irregularities. Nowhere does RCW <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>6.21.110 give a purchaser the right to withdraw.

As both the judgment creditor and the successful purchaser, he moved to confirm. <em>Id. </em>Before confirmation was complete, he discovered the judgment debtor (his ex-wife) was planning to redeem the property and discharge the remaining debt in bankruptcy. <em>Id. </em>The judgment creditor/purchaser sought to withdraw his bid or to increase it to prevent redemption. <em>Id. </em>The court allowed the withdrawal and ordered a resale of the property. <em>Id. </em>The judgment debtor objected. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that “only the judgment creditor or purchaser has standing to move for confirmation of a bid at a sheriff’s sale, and that before confirmation, the highest bidder may be permitted to withdraw.” <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>

The court noted that per the statute, only the judgment creditor or the successful purchaser could move to confirm. <em>Id. </em>The judgment debtor could not move to confirm, and the court could not confirm a sale sua sponte. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32. Since the purchaser/judgment creditor withdrew his motion to confirm before confirmation, there was no other individual that could move the court to confirm the sale and a resale of the property was the only way to resolve the situation. <em>Id. </em>at 32.

A plain reading of the statute indicates that a land sale should be confirmed after there is a successful purchaser, barring timely objection by a proper individual and substantial irregularities. Either a purchaser or a judgment creditor can move to confirm, but a purchaser has no right to unilaterally withdraw his or her bid.

The plain reading of the statute clearly articulates the powers of each of the parties. Only the judgment creditor or purchaser can move to confirm.

The notices were sent on March 16,2012, but the date Pashniak filed his objection to the Mallarino sale is unclear. The document in the clerk’s papers indicates the objection was filed on April 9, 2012. But Pashniak has filed a motion to supplement the record with a copy of the objection that bears a stamp indicating the document was received on March 22, 2012, the same day as his objection in the Parsons case. This copy was not submitted to the trial court because the timeliness of the objection was not raised until the Court of Appeals. But, we do not need to decide the timeliness issue since we decide this case on the substantive question of statutory interpretation, not on whether Pashniak missed the mandatory 20 day deadline. Accordingly, we deny Pashniak’s motion to supplement the record.</p>

This <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>case arose through OneWest Bank FSB’s attempted foreclosure of Washington property based on a reverse mortgage that an Idaho court ordered through Bill McKee’s conservatorship proceedings. McKee’s daughter, Maureen M. Erickson, challenges the foreclosure, claiming the reverse mortgage is void because she was the actual owner of the property and the Idaho court had no jurisdiction to affect Washington property, among other claims. The trial court granted summary judgment for OneWest, allowing it to proceed with foreclosure, but the Court of Appeals, Division Three, reversed and granted summary judgment for Erickson. We must primarily decide whether the courts below were required to give full faith and credit to the Idaho court orders. We hold that full faith and credit is due and OneWest is entitled to foreclose its reverse mortgage on the Spokane property. We reverse the Court of Appeals.</p>

Erickson did not record the deed for over four years.

OneWest moved for summary judgment, asserting that Erickson took title to the Spokane property subject to the recorded reverse mortgage that OneWest now possessed. OneWest claimed that it was a bona fide mortgagee protected by Washington’s recording act, chapter 65.08 ROW, because neither OneWest nor its predecessor had notice of Erickson’s interest in the property when the deed of trust was recorded on October 30, 2007.</p>
    <p id="b104-7" data-blocks='[["BL_104.7",104,[202,1295,1252,638]]]'>¶9 In response, Erickson disputed OneWest’s bona fide mortgagee status, claiming OneWest’s predecessor should have had inquiry notice that Erickson claimed ownership to the Spokane property because she lived there and possessed a quitclaim deed at the time Bruna executed the deed of trust. Erickson also challenged the conservator’s authority, claiming an Idaho court could not direct a conservator to affect Washington property when McKee was not an Idaho resident. Finally, she asserted that OneWest did not hold the promissory note and claimed the deed of trust was not properly acknowledged. Erickson requested summary judgment in her favor.</p>
    <p id="b104-8" data-blocks='[["BL_104.8",104,[202,1957,1247,422]],["BL_105.1",105,[202,345,1252,260]]]'>¶10 In its reply, OneWest disputed the claim of inquiry notice, asserting there was no reason to inquire about Erickson’s potential property interests when all records showed McKee as the property owner and current resident of the Spokane property at the time his conservator entered into the deed of trust on his behalf. OneWest also responded to Erickson’s argument that an Idaho conservator lacks authority over nonresidents’ out-of-state property, citing <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>provisions of Idaho’s Uniform Probate Code to argue that conservators have broad statutory authority to manage property in all states. Finally, OneWest claimed that it legally possessed the promissory note and that the deed of trust was sufficiently acknowledged.</p>
    <p id="b105-4" data-blocks='[["BL_105.4",105,[202,628,1246,367]]]'>¶11 OneWest then filed a surreply, which included a copy of the Idaho court order directing Bruna to enter into a reverse mortgage on McKee’s Washington property. One-West was initially unable to produce the official order because it was sealed. The order includes Erickson’s signature stating that she “read and approved” the order directing the reverse mortgage. CP at 111 (capitalization omitted).</p>

Erickson attached a declaration providing “background” in order to “understand the events that have led to the current situation affecting [her] property.” CP at 124. She explained that she obtained title to the property because she had helped her father with the initial down payment, she remained his primary caregiver for years, and he ultimately transferred title to her when she discovered he had concealed her mother’s will from her. She attached letters from her father to the Idaho court, expressing his displeasure with the conservatorship proceedings and claiming he was a Washington resident. Erickson also claimed she “[does] not recall seeing or signing any court order” from the con-<a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>servatorship proceedings, including the order directing the mortgage that purportedly bore her signature.

    <p id="b106-4" data-blocks='[["BL_106.4",106,[202,471,1247,917]]]'>¶14 OneWest responded with an affidavit including faxes from Erickson stating her intention to pay off the reverse mortgage and requesting extensions of time to pay. OneWest also reasserted that it was a bona fide mortgagee because it had no reason to know of or inquire about the unrecorded quitclaim deed, especially when Erickson appeared to have signed the order directing the reverse mortgage and allegedly provided funds to facilitate the closing of the reverse mortgage. In response to Erickson’s challenge to the court order, OneWest reemphasized the conservator’s statutory authority to enter the reverse mortgage without a court order,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> but also pointed to the order as additional support. Finally, OneWest claimed that Erickson could not collaterally attack the Idaho court’s conserva-torship proceedings because “[a] 11 such claims were already adjudicated by the Idaho Court in front of the proper parties to the matter.” CP at 175.</p>

First, it found the Idaho court order directing Bruna to enter into the reverse mortgage was admissible as a business record but stated that even if it were not, the “Order is not critical to this Court’s determination of this matter, and this Court would have reached the same conclusion without consideration of the Idaho Order.” CP at 188-89. Second, the trial court accepted OneWest’s exhibits relating to the closing and repayment of the loan, but again noted that the trial <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>court would have reached the same conclusion even if these exhibits were inadmissible. Finally, the trial court recognized that Erickson’s supplemental declaration was “predominately unsupported hearsay,” but the court decided not to strike the exhibit because it was helpful to understanding Erickson’s “ ‘side of the story,’ ” although the court “assign [ed] it little weight.” CP at 189. The trial court held that OneWest was a bona fide purchaser for value and that Erickson took the Spokane property subject to OneWest’s deed of trust.</p>

For support, the court relied on “ancient principles” and cases suggesting that “the courts of one state cannot directly affect the legal title to land situated in another state.” <em>Id. </em>at 479-80. The court gave three reasons for rejecting OneWest’s claim that Erickson could not collaterally attack the conservator’s authority. First, the record did not demonstrate that the Idaho court ruled on McKee’s domicile or its jurisdiction to encumber Washington property. Second, the court questioned whether Erickson was a party to the Idaho proceeding (and therefore whether the Idaho court could bind her).

Erickson seems to argue that Washington courts have similar authority to determine the validity of the Idaho court orders at issue. However, we explicitly noted in a footnote in <em>Kowalewski </em>that the full faith and credit clause requires <em>states </em>to recognize the judgments of other states. <em><a href="/citations/?q=285%20P.3d%2034" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="285 P.3d 34">Id.</a> </em>at 552 n.1.

Full faith and credit requires us to accept those determinations by the Idaho court because it had personal jurisdiction over McKee’s conservatorship proceedings and jurisdiction to enter the reverse mortgage order as a judgment affecting personal interests in out-of-state property.</p>

      <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>¶76 I disagree, however, with the majority’s decision to go on to hold that these orders are binding on our courts because of the full faith and credit clause. Majority at 64. Article IV, section 1 of the United States Constitution guarantees full faith and credit to a state court’s “final judgment.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">16</a> It does not, however, extend that guarantee to orders that are interlocutory or subject to modification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">17</a> The problem in this case is that we can’t tell whether the Idaho orders are final judgments or interlocutory orders subject to modification. Neither party ever presented the trial court with any “judgment” from the Idaho case. And, according to the Idaho District Court of Shoshone County docket sheet filed as part of the record in this case,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">18</a> both of the orders relevant here (the “Letters of Conserva-torship” appointing Bruna as conservator, Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 18, and the “Order Directing [Bruna] to Facilitate a Reverse Mortgage of Property,” CP at 108) issued in the middle of litigation. CP at 99. It is possible that these orders are “final judgments”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">19</a> for purposes of full faith and credit analysis. But it is possible that they are not. No record was ever developed on this question, no argument was made on this “final judgment” question, and no ruling was entered by the trial court on this question. The parties simply did <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>not raise the issue of full faith and credit in the trial court. And because the Court of Appeals based its opinion entirely on what it called “ancient principles” prohibiting courts from affecting property interests in another state, <em>OneWest, </em><a href="/wash-app/184/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="184 Wash. App. 462" data-case-ids="4364350" data-case-paths="/wash-app/184/0462-01">184 Wn. App. at 479-80</a>, the parties understandably limited their briefing on the full faith and credit issue, in this court, to those ostensibly ancient principles.</p>
    <p id="b131-4" data-blocks='[["BL_131.4",131,[201,747,1248,475]]]'>¶77 I would keep this court’s holding within similar limits. I would reject, as the majority does, the Court of Appeals’ assertion that foreign judgments can never “affect[ ]” property interests in our state. <em><a href="/wash-app/184/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="184 Wash. App. 462" data-case-ids="4364350" data-case-paths="/wash-app/184/0462-01">Id.</a> </em>But I would clarify that this conclusion is based on an analysis of the scope of the foreign court’s jurisdiction or power to act, not on the full faith and credit clause—which concerns our own court’s duty (or lack thereof) to honor such foreign court orders under the full faith and credit clause.</p>
    <p id="b131-5" data-blocks='[["BL_131.5",131,[202,1258,1246,476]]]'>¶78 Indeed, I would make clear that the full faith and credit clause is not even relevant to the question presented here, i.e., whether OneWest was entitled to rely on those orders. I would therefore go straight to the issue of whether OneWest is a bona fide purchaser. No decision on whether the orders are <em>actually </em>entitled to full faith and credit is needed to answer that question. Instead, we need analyze only what constitutes a bona fide purchaser under Idaho law.</p>
    <p id="b131-6" data-blocks='[["BL_131.6",131,[202,1769,1247,594]],["BL_132.1",132,[202,345,1246,539]]]'>¶79 That analysis shows that Idaho statutory law protects OneWest as a bona fide mortgagee. The reason is that, as the majority notes, in the trial court the parties disputed an Idaho conservator’s <em>statutory </em>authority to affect a nonresident’s out-of-state property. Majority at 50-53. The trial court ruled in favor of OneWest on this issue, rejecting Erickson’s arguments that the reverse mortgage exceeded the jurisdictional limits of Idaho’s probate code. <em>See </em>CP at 60 (Mem. in Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J.) (arguing that OneWest’s predecessor should have known that Idaho statutes do not confer “authority [on] a conservator appointed <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>in Idaho to transfer real property interests in Washington purportedly belonging to a Washington resident”)- The trial court was correct. Even if we accepted Erickson’s argument that the conservator lacked actual statutory authority to encumber McKee’s out-of-state property because he was not an Idaho resident, Idaho conservatorship law would protect OneWest’s interests as a bona fide mortgagee anyway. That law specifically protects third parties who deal with conservators, even in situations when the court may have lacked jurisdiction:</p>
    <blockquote id="b132-4" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[247,924,1206,594]]]'>A person who in good faith either assists a conservator or deals with him for value in any transaction other than those requiring a court order as provided in section 15-5-408 of this Part, is protected as if the conservator properly exercised this power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, except that restrictions on powers of conservators which are endorsed on letters [of conservatorship] are effective as to third persons ....

    <p id="b132-7" data-blocks='[["BL_132.7",132,[201,1790,1253,475]]]'>¶80 I would reverse the Court of Appeals’ decision and affirm the trial court’s decision to grant summary judgment to OneWest on the basis that it is a bona fide mortgagee under Idaho statutory law. I would not reach the question of whether the orders at issue in this case are final judgments entitled to full faith and credit. In this way, I would avoid reaching a constitutional question that was neither argued in the trial court nor thoroughly briefed on appeal. I therefore respectfully concur.</p>

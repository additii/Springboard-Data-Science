The inmate can calculate it, the Department can calculate it, it’s two-thirds of the potential earned release time—that’s the way it works. So let’s suppose it’s a thousand chips. The inmate walks into the prison. At the end of the road down there, at the end of his sentence somewhere, is a thousand chips waiting for him. Each one of those chips represents a day less time that he is going to have to serve if he behaves throughout the course of his sentence. Now, he is told . . . we’re using those chips to calculate when your actual release date will be, and between now and then, if you misbehave, you’re going to lose some of those chips. They’re there waiting for you, but you’re going to lose some of them. And as you go through, you might be able to get some of those back. But we’re going to use those chips as a tool to decide when your earned release date is. So he has no present right to those chips—he can’t say I want all my chips now. He has—he doesn’t earn those chips as he goes through month by month, day by day. In other states, he might, but not in Washington.</blockquote>

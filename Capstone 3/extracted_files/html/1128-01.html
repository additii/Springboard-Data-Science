It was contended in that ease that the proceeding was a taking of appellant’s property without due process of law, and the court said: “The sufficiency of notice and of opportunity of the property owner to be heard, to constitute due process of law, is a question that has had the attention of every court of the country, and, if any one thing concerning the law of taxation can be said, to be settled beyond doubt, it is that: “If provision is made ‘for notice to and hearing of each proprietor, at some stage of the proceedings, upon the question, what proportion of the tax shall be assessed upon his land, there is no taking of his property without due process of law.’ ”</p>

The court further said, on page 765: “We think it the clear and reasonable duty of appellants to stop' their trains at the depot, or else build umbrella sheds for the protection of the passengers, who are 'compelled to come and <em>go </em>one hundred and fifty yards in order to ¡board the trains or reach the depot.” And, because of this statement in the opinion of the court, it is contended that it modified the order of the Railroad Commission. But just below this statement is the following: “The requirement of the construction of necessary facilities in the operation of the business of a public carrier is in no sense taking its property without due process of law. The contention that the order to build the sheds will unnecessarily burden interstate commerce is without foundation in fact. * <em>* * </em>We cannot agree that there is no necessity for the sheds.

E. 891</a>, relied on by counsel for appellee, are not applicable, as the statutes of Missouri and Illinois expressly provided that the Commission shall make and file its findings of fact in writing. In the Barker case the opinion quotes that section of the Missouri statutes. There is no such provision found in the Kansas statute. The only act in writing required by the statute is found in § 16 of the act (Laws 1911, c. 238), which provides: ‘All orders and decisions of the Public Utilities Commission whereby any rates * * * are altered, changed, modified, fixed or established, shall be reduced to writing, and a copy thereof, duly certified, shall be served on the public utility or common carrier affected thereby, by registered mail.’ ”</p>

The power is expressly made to depend on the condition that after full hearing and investigation the Commission shall find existing rates to he unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential. We conclude that a valid order of the Commission under the act must contain a finding of fact after hearing and investigation, upon which the order is founded, and that, for lack of such a finding, the order in this case was void.</blockquote>

The maxim that a Legislature may not delegate legislative power has some qualifications, as in the creation of municipalities, and also in the creation of administrative hoards to apply to the myriad details of rate schedules the regulatory police power of the State. The latter qualification is made necessary in order that the legislative power may be effectively exercised. In creating such an administrative agency the Legislature, to- prevent its being a pure delegation of legislative power, must enjoin upon it a certain course of procedure and certain rules of decision in the performance of its function. It is a wholesome and necessary principle that such an agency must pursue the procedure and rules enjoined and show a substantial compliance therewith to <a id="p1148" href="#p1148" data-label="1148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1148</a>give validity to its action. When, therefore, such an administrative agency is required as a condition precedent to an order, to make a finding of facts, the validity of the order must rest upon the needed finding. If it is lacking, the order is ineffective.</blockquote>

We cannot agree to this. It is doubtful whether the facts averred in the petition were sufficient to justify a finding that the contract rates were unreasonably low; but we do not find it necessary to answer this question. We rest our decision on the principle that an express finding of unreasonableness by the Commission was indispensable under the statutes of the State.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b1166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1166.5",1166,[318,1139,1202,1013]]]'>It will be observed that the holding, that an express finding to give the order of the Utilities Commission effect was made in the construction of a statute which did not provide that the finding should be a condition precedent, nor did the Kansas statute provide, as does ours, that the finding should be promulgated by filing it in any particular place. The principle involved and applied by the Supreme Court of the United States was that an agency discharging a delegated power could bind persons affected by its order only when it had exercised its power in the manner provided by the statute delegating the power. If that principle were applied here, as we think it should be, it would result in holding that, as the Eailroad Commission had not complied with the law in promulgating its finding by filing it as required by law, a violation of its finding was not an offense, and, as it was admitted at the trial from which this appeal comes that the finding had not been filed as required by law, it is our opinion that the judgments imposing fines should be reversed.</p>

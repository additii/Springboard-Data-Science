On appeal, Reyes requested a new SVP commitment hearing, arguing that the trial court committed structural error by closing a pretrial hearing in violation of article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution. The Court of Appeals rejected Reyes’ argument and affirmed his commitment.

    <p id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[201,483,1247,849]]]'>¶2 The legislature has established a civil involuntary commitment system for individuals who are found to be an SVP. <em>See generally </em>ch. 71.09 RCW. The statute defines a “sexually violent predator” as a “person who has been convicted of or charged with a crime of sexual violence and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility.” RCW 71.09.020(18). Under the statutory framework, when an offender’s sentence is about to expire, the State may file a petition alleging that the offender is an SVP. RCW 71.09.025, .030. If a court or jury finds that the individual is an SVP beyond a reasonable doubt, then he or she is committed to the custody of the DSHS until the offender is rehabilitated and safe to enter the community. RCW 71.09.060(1).</p>
    <p id="b385-6" data-blocks='[["BL_385.6",385,[202,1359,1246,637]]]'>¶3 While Reyes was incarcerated for a residential burglary, the State petitioned to civilly commit Reyes as an SVP. The petition relied on the residential burglary, which involved a sexual attack, and a prior conviction for child rape as qualifying sexually violent offenses. The petition also alleged that Reyes suffered from several personality disorders, including pedophilia, frotteurism, exhibitionism, and antisocial personality disorder. The State withdrew the petition after Reyes was convicted of committing two additional sexual assaults on custodial staff. Shortly before the end of Reyes’ sentence for the new assault convictions, the State refiled its petition.</p>

The court heard oral argument on <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>the motion in chambers. The record does not reflect why the motion was held in chambers or that the court conducted the required procedures for closing the hearing. At the hearing, the assistant attorney general appeared by telephone from her office in Seattle. It does not seem she was aware that the hearing was held in chambers. The judge, the court reporter, and two attorneys representing Reyes were present for the hearing.</p>

Johnson, J., concurring, joined by Chambers, J.), 53 (Madsen, C.J., dissenting, joined by C. Johnson and Fairhurst, JJ.).

I disagree, however, with the majority’s description of what <em>this context </em>is. First, the majority treats the context of this case as akin to the context presented in <em>In re Detention of D.F.F., </em><a href="/wash-2d/172/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="172 Wash. 2d 37" data-case-ids="4018239" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/172/0037-01">172 Wn.2d 37</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=256%20P.3d%20357" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="256 P.3d 357">256 P.3d 357</a> (2011) (plurality opinion), but claims that <em>D.F.F. </em>rejected reversal as the remedy for an error of this sort; in contrast, I would hold that the context of this case (closure of a single pretrial motion on which no testimony or evidence is taken) is totally different from the context of <em>D.F.F. </em>(closure of a completed trial), and that <em>D.F.F. </em>adopted reversal as the remedy for the latter but not for the former. Second, the majority treats the context of this case as akin to the context presented in criminal cases by relying on a federal criminal case, rather than a state civil case, to hold that reversal is not the appropriate remedy here; in contrast, I would hold that the state civil and federal criminal contexts are different and we cannot use one set of cases to determine the appropriate remedy in the other set of cases. The first point is important because <em>D.F.F., </em>a civil commitment case, clearly held that reversal is the remedy for complete closure of a civil commitment trial, and we should not overrule that holding. The second point is important because our prior state criminal cases have clearly held that the remedy for closure of a pretrial motion hearing is reversal, and we should not overrule those holdings. Unfortunately, I think the majority overrules both.</p>

They did so for one very specific reason: because civil commitment itself, a significant deprivation of liberty, constituted “sufficient prejudice” that requires the remedy of a new trial. Specifically, Justices J.M. Johnson and Chambers wrote in the pivotal concurrence: “I agree with the dissent that ‘structural error’ analysis does not apply to the civil context. However, D.F.F., as a respondent committed after a closed hearing, demonstrates sufficient prejudice to warrant relief. Further, I agree with the lead opinion that the release of a transcript to D.F.F. is clearly not a sufficient remedy.

Four of those justices called the problem of closure throughout the trial “structural error” and therefore voted to reverse. Two other justices called the problem of courtroom closure throughout the trial nonstructural error but “prejudicial]” enough to vote for reversal. Those two additional votes were necessary for decision in D.F.F.; those two votes narrowed the ground of decision from automatic structural error warranting reversal to error warranting reversal due to the consequence of complete commitment as a result of a completely closed trial. Only three members of the court applied a far more forgiving type of harmless error review, found no harm, and would have affirmed.</p>

But <em>Waller </em>is a federal criminal case, and it imposes a remedy that we explicitly rejected as early as 1995. The <em>Waller </em>Court held that the appropriate remedy for unconstitutional courtroom closure of a suppression hearing in a criminal case was remand for a new suppression hearing. In <em>State v.

We recognized that that was the remedy that the State sought and that the United States Supreme Court had adopted. But we took a different path when faced with the exact same situation, that is, a closed suppression hearing that would require new testimony that might differ at a new hearing. We chose the remedy of complete reversal of the conviction instead.</p>

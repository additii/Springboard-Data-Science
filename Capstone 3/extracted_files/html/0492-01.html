Exit 299 provides access to roads on both sides of the border, including North Idaho Road, which proceeds south, straddling the Washington-Idaho border. Pruczinski turned south on North Idaho Road, heading back toward Idaho. Following Pruczinski south along North Idaho Road, Ashby observed her drifting over the fog line and the double yellow lines. After the car exceeded the posted speed limit by nine miles per hour, Ashby activated his lights and initiated a traffic stop.

If the State denies the claim, the claimant may file suit in the district court, which has jurisdiction over tort claims against government actors. I.C. §§ 6-910, 6-914. The statute of limitations for such actions is two years. I.C. § 6-911. Significantly, Idaho government agencies and employees are exempt from claims arising from certain intentional torts absent a showing of malice or criminal intent. I.C. § 6-904(3).

She did not file a claim under I.C. § 6-905, which would prevent her from suing a government official in Idaho, and the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury suits has run, which would prevent her from suing Ashby in his individual capacity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> If Washington declines jurisdiction, it is likely that Pruczinski will not be able to bring this suit in Idaho.

Its importance should be carefully weighed in consideration of the circumstances. The circumstances are that Pruczinski did not meet the prerequisite of filing a claim with the Idaho state patrol within 180 days of the incident, and instead chose to file suit in Washington prior to the two-year statute of limitations running in Idaho.

The Court of Appeals majority concluded that assuming jurisdiction did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. <em>Pruczinski, </em><a href="/wash-app/185/0876-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="185 Wash.

This was a traffic stop by an Idaho state trooper of an Idaho resident driving a car with Idaho plates. The pursuit began in Idaho, allegedly on suspicion of drunk driving, with an intent to protect Idaho citizens from drunk drivers. Although the pursuit crossed into Washington, it quickly headed back toward Idaho on to a road that straddles the border. Ashby did not know he was in Washington, Pruczinski did not claim she was in Washington at the time of the arrest, and no signs indicated that they were in Washington. Idaho and Washington law may both need to be applied to determine if Ashby was acting within the scope of his duties and, if so, whether he was acting with malice or criminal intent. As the dissent at the Court of Appeals pointed out, “Idaho State will inevitably be drawn into this dispute as Trooper Ashby’s employer.” <em><a href="/wash-app/185/0876-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="185 Wash.

      <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>¶19 Washington State’s connection to this case is the fact that when Pruczinski pulled her car to the side of the road, she did so inside the Washington border. Ashby’s concession that he was in Washington cannot be ignored; it is undisputed for purposes of his motion to dismiss that he was on Washington soil when the alleged tortious conduct took place. Were this a criminal case, Washington State would undoubtedly have jurisdiction over the defendant. <em>See State v. Norman, </em><a href="/wash-2d/145/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="145 Wash. 2d 578" data-case-ids="314628" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/145/0578-01">145 Wn.2d 578</a>, 598-99, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20P.3d%201161" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="40 P.3d 1161">40 P.3d 1161</a> (2002) (holding that defendants apprehended north of the 49th parallel, yet south of the Canadian border, were subject to criminal jurisdiction in Washington); RCW 9A.04.030(1).

In a case such as this one, Ashby’s arguments are insufficient to overcome the fact that the alleged act and injury both took place on Washington soil. We cannot say that it offends traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice to exercise jurisdiction over an alleged tortfeasor when the tort and the injury occur in this state. Accordingly, we hold that either state has an interest in exercising jurisdiction.</p>

RCW 10.89.010 provides that a peace officer of another state who enters Washington in fresh pursuit of a person believed to be driving under the influence will have the same authority to arrest and hold the person in custody as a peace officer of Washington. Here, it is undisputed that Ashby was an Idaho state trooper and therefore a “member of a duly organized state, county or municipal peace unit of another state.” RCW 10.89.010. As such, he had authority to pursue Pruczinski into Washington upon suspicion that she was driving under the influence and to arrest her. However, a development of the record would be helpful to determine when, exactly, he suspected her of drunk driving and whether this suspicion was reasonable. Furthermore, under RCW 10.89.020, when an arrest is made under RCW 10.89.010, the arresting officer must take the suspect before a magistrate in the county of the arrest—here, <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>Spokane County—so that the magistrate may determine the lawfulness of the arrest. Ashby did not do this. On remand, the trial court will need to consider whether this speaks more to the fact that he believed he was in Idaho or that he made an unlawful arrest. Additionally, because evidence surrounding the pursuit and arrest—such as Ashby’s police report—were struck by the trial court, the record should be developed in order to determine whether Ashby had authority to arrest Pruczinski under RCW 10.31.100.</p>

If Officer Ashby was improperly exercising extrajurisdictional authority, or behaving in a manner so unbecoming an Idaho state trooper that it cannot be said he was acting within the scope of his employment, then there are no comity concerns. This is a determination typically made by the trial court. We therefore remand to the trial court to determine—in light of these and other relevant considerations—whether this case should be dismissed on comity grounds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

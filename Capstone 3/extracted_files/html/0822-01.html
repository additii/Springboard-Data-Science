That, to our mind, is the clear meaning of the words used. Certainly, in this case, District No. 19 would be affected, for, by the change of the territory, its revenue would be diminished; District No. 2 would be affected, because it would be burdened with an additional number of children to be educated, which might be entirely out of proportion with the additional revenue accruing to it. It was the intention of the Legislature that no change of this hind should be made, except with the consent of all parties concerned.</p>

That section was construed and special reference made to that part of it providing for a majority of the electors in the district to be divided in the case of <em>School District No. 45 </em>v. <em>School District No. 8, </em><a href="/ark/119/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="119 Ark. 149" data-case-ids="8718240" data-case-paths="/ark/119/0149-01">119 Ark. 149</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=177%20S.W.%20892" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="177 S.W. 892">177 S. W. 892</a>. In that case a part of the territory of District No. 45 was sought to be added to District No. 8. There was no change in the boundaries of District No. 8 except by the addition of territory, while District No. 45 was divided, a part of its territory being detached and added to District No. 8. The court below, in that case, ordered the change on a petition which contained a majority of the aggregate number of electors of both districts, but all of the petitioners save one resided in District No. 8. This court reversed the order of the court below, holding that, inasmuch as District No. 45 was the one divided, it was necessary for a majority of the qualified electors residing in that district to have signed the petition. <a id="p828" href="#p828" data-label="828" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*828</a>Counsel for the appellee, School District No. 8, contended that the meaning of the language of the statute was that a petition of the majority of each of the districts to be affected was required, but this court held that such an interpretation called for the substitution of the word “affected” for the word used in the statute, which had an altogether different meaning, and was broader than the words used in the statute, and that, although the electors of District No. 8 might be affected by the change, they could not be counted on the petition, and that there^fore the petition in that case did not comply with the requirements of the statute.</p>

We are o'f the opinion also that the position of counsel for the appellant, that § 8821, <em>supra, </em>was repealed by act No. 156 of the Acts of 1927, is untenable,, and that that section remains unchanged, because there is no conflict between its terms and the act of 1927. It follows that District No. 19, being affected by the judgment of the court, it was a party in interest, and entitled to prosecute an appeal from the ruling of the county board of education.</p>

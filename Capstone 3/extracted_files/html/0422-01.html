She was 14, and he was 18. Both were students in the Bethel School District. Neither N.L. nor any responsible adult on the field knew that Clark was a registered sex offender who had previously sexually as<a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>saulted a younger girl who had been about N.L.’s age at the time. The Pierce County Sheriff’s Department had informed Clark’s school principal of his sex offender status, but the principal took no action in response. Clark persuaded N.L. to leave campus with him and raped her. N.L. sued the district, alleging negligence. We must decide whether Bethel School District’s duty to N.L. ended when she left campus and whether its alleged negligence, as a matter of law, was not a proximate cause of her injury. The answer to both questions is no. We affirm.</p>

The two schools share the track field between them, and on April 24, 2007, the junior and senior high schools were both using the field for practice. N.L. alleges that Clark acted as a coach and mentor to the younger students on both schools’ teams. During practice, a mutual friend introduced N.L. to Clark. The two exchanged phone numbers and started exchanging text messages. Clark told N.L. he was 16 years old. He invited her to lunch after school the next day. Unbeknown to either the junior or senior high school track coach or apparently any other district employee on the field that day, Clark was a registered sex offender.</p>

They left campus in Clark’s car. Clark drove past the Burger King, ostensibly to fetch something he had forgotten at home.

The friend told her mother, who informed both the school and N.L.’s mother. The school called the police, and the next month, Clark was charged with third degree rape. Clark ultimately pleaded guilty to second degree assault.</p>

By the seventh grade, he had started making racial slurs and inappropriate sexual comments in class. This behavior escalated to physical assaults and sexual misconduct against younger female students. In June 2004, when Clark was 16, he sexually assaulted another student at Bethel Junior High School. Based on that assault, Clark was charged with indecent liberties and suspended for the rest of the school year. That October, Clark pleaded guilty to attempted indecent liberties, was sentenced to 12 months of community custody, and was required to register as a level one sex offender. Among other things, he was ordered to have no contact with people two or more years younger than himself. N.L. is four years younger than Clark.</p>
    <p id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.6",465,[202,1470,1246,692]]]'>¶6 That December, the Pierce County sheriff notified Bethel High School’s principal that Clark was a registered sex offender. There is considerable evidence in the record that suggests the principal did not inform Clark’s teachers, coaches, or relevant staff of Clark’s status. The evidence also suggests that the principal did not develop a safety plan, let alone one that would have helped Clark avoid students two or more years younger than him. The record also suggests there was a district policy in place at the time that required the principal to inform Clark’s teachers of his status.

Superintendent Billings observed that “RCW and Bethel District policy require that the principal ‘must inform any teacher of the student and any other personnel who should be aware of the information’ of a student’s sex offender status.” CP at 300. She also noted that “[m]odel policies for Washington State, the standard of care recognized and implemented by most school districts - but not by Bethel - provide! ] that ‘other personnel’ includes coaches and counselors, neither of whom were informed” of Clark’s sex offender status. <em>Id. </em>She concluded, among other things, that “[t]he haphazard nature of Bethel’s approach to keeping its students safe from registered sex predators frankly boggles the imagination,” and that the district “fell unconscionably below the accepted standard of care ‘to protect students from dangers that are known or should have been known.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 302, 304.</p>

The district moved for summary judgment, arguing that it had no duty to N.L. because she was not actually in its custody at the time she was raped and that N.L’s “decision to skip track practice and leave campus with Clark were ‘independent act[s]’ that ‘brfoke] the chain of causation.’ ” CP at 20, 21 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Riojas v.

First, almost nothing in tort law is taken to its logical conclusion because there is almost always a countervailing principle. Second, in this case, taking the facts alleged as true (as we must at this stage), the district gave a registered sex offender the imprimatur of coach and mentor to younger students, knowing that he had previously preyed on young girls. The district put these children in danger without informing any responsible staff member of the sex offender’s status, in apparent violation of its own policy. This is a far cry from simply knowing about a student’s violent tendencies. Third, the alleged breach happened on campus, while the student was in the school district’s custody.

The relationship took place entirely off school grounds, outside of school hours, not during any school-sponsored activity, and without the knowledge or consent of the school. <em>Id. </em>at 41-42. Plaintiffs argued that the breach— failure to take adequate precautions, failure to monitor teachers, and failure to have a written policy in place forbidding student-teacher relationships—occurred while the student was in school custody and therefore “locate the tort within the scope of [the school’s] authority.” <em>Id. </em>at 45. The court rejected this argument and held the school did not owe the student a duty, finding that “the responsibility for supervision at the time of the alleged activities had shifted away from the school” and, further, that “the proximity between the breach of duty complained of and the alleged injury is so remote that it raises the possibility of finding proximate cause absent as a matter of law.” <em>Id. </em>The court went on to identify the danger of expanding a school district’s liability—which the majority does here—stating that “[b]y [plaintiffs’ logic, a school which failed to monitor student relationships and provide adequate sex education would also be liable for teen pregnancies, regardless of the circumstances, because teen pregnancies are ‘within a general field of danger which should have been anticipated.’ ” <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McLeod, </em>42 Wn.2d at 321).</p>

The breach alleged is that Bethel School District did not have a sex offender policy in place, and if it had, N.L. and Clark would never have met. Had Clark never met N.L., then they would not have texted and planned to leave campus and have lunch and Clark would not have taken N.L. to his home and would not have raped her. This is very similar to the argument rejected by the Court of Appeals in <em>Scott. </em>The majority attempts to answer petitioner’s argument—that the harm was not foreseeable because N.L.’s injury was the result of Clark’s criminal conduct after N.L. skipped track practice—by isolating each element and concluding that each, on its own, is not dispositive.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">7</a>

If N.L. were Clark’s classmate, the school could not prevent her from being introduced to Clark by a mutual friend, from exchanging text messages and phone calls with Clark, or from skipping practice and going to his house, but could still be held liable for a sexual assault. Taken to its logical conclusion, if a school has notice of a student’s violent tendencies, under the majority’s view, it could be found liable for an off-campus, non-school-related assault. If a school district is aware of a student’s emotional or behavioral disorder,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">8</a> it would be potentially liable for a student’s harmful actions off campus, even at a student’s own home.

Here, Clark and N.L. were introduced by a mutual friend. The meeting took “just took a couple seconds.” Clerk’s Papers at 52. The alleged breach is that if Bethel School District had had a better policy in place for Clark, or if more teachers and coaches had known about his status as a sex offender, this meeting would have been prevented. But the school did not introduce them; a mutual friend did. This same mutual friend gave Clark’s phone number to N.L., and N.L. and Clark subsequently exchanged phone calls and text messages. In these communications, Clark asked N.L. if she wanted to go to lunch with him. They both skipped track practice the next day and left <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>school together. It was at this point that Clark took N.L. to his home and sexually assaulted her. The breach alleged, therefore, is not that the district did not have a policy in place, but rather that the school allowed a registered sex offender to meet another student. Even if the school district had a policy, and even if it implemented a plan that directed Clark to stay away from younger female students, and we had the same facts presented here, it could not have prevented Clark and N.L. being introduced by a mutual friend. The alleged breach—allowing a registered sex offender to meet and interact with classmates—cannot be prevented short of isolating registered sex offenders from their classmates because of their status or notifying students and their parents of its students’ sex offender statuses.

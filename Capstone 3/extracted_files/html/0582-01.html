With the intention of committing an easy robbery, they drove together to the rural home of Mike and Dorothy Nickoloff, who were 82 and 74 years old, respectively. They knocked on the Nickoloffs’ door, and Mrs. Nickoloff let them inside. Rice made a phone call while McNeil had a drink of water. Mrs. Nickoloff returned to the kitchen to eat dinner while Mr. Nickoloff watched television in the living room. McNeil and Rice then each stabbed one of the Nickoloffs, both of whom died. McNeil and Rice stole two television sets from the Nickoloff home.</p>
    <p id="b628-6" data-blocks='[["BL_628.6",628,[202,1681,1251,583]]]'>f 5 McNeil and Rice were each charged with one count of aggravated first degree murder and one count of accomplice to aggravated first degree murder. After holding declination hearings, the juvenile court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and orders permanently declining jurisdiction over both cases and transferring them to Yakima County Superior Court. The State sought the death penalty against both petitioners. McNeil and Rice each filed a motion for dismissal of the State’s notice of intent to seek the death penalty. The trial court denied their motions, and discretionary review was denied.</p>

McNeil was sentenced to two life sentences without the possibility of early release, the mandatory minimum sentence for aggravated first degree murder. As an exceptional sentence, the trial court ordered the two life sentences be served consecutively, rather than concurrently, based on findings of fact and conclusions of law determining that the Nickoloffs were targeted because they were particularly vulnerable.</p>

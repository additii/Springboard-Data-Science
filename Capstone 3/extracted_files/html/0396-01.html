The appellant seeks to collect fees against certain delinquent lands of the district embraced in this suit and have them, taxed against each particular tract described therein as costs for his compensation for the collection of the delinquent taxes for 1929 and 1930 as provided in said act 121 of 1921.</p>
    <p id="b416-6" data-blocks='[["BL_416.10",416,[260,1441,1204,984]]]'>He alleged that said act making provision for the collection of delinquent taxes ivas enacted long prior to the adoption of amendment No. 12 to the Constitution, prohibiting the passage of local acts by the Legislature, and that by its terms he was entitled to have the court fix a reasonable sum to be taxed as attorney’s fees against each tract of land set out in the complaint; and that said act of the Legislature, No. 274 of 1933, entitled: “An Act to Amend § 1 of act 121 of the Special Acts of the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas, approved February 1, 1921,” left out of the provisions of said act all reference to the collection fees for the service, and instead provided: “And it shall be the duty of said attorney to do and perform all and singular the duties incumbent on the attorney for the Jefferson County Bridge District, and said service shall be performed by the prosecuting attorney of said county without additional salary to that now provided by law for the prosecuting attorney of Jefferson County.”</p>

    <p id="b417-3" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[216,655,1201,890]]]'>The court made the following declaration of law: “The intervention in this case as presented by E. W. Brockman, as prosecuting attorney of Jefferson County and made attorney for the Jefferson County Bridge District under act No. 121 of the General Assembly for the year 1921, presents the issue as to whether act .No. 274 of the Acts of the General Assembly for the year 1933, amended or repealed said act No. 121 for the year 1921. This court is not passing on any phase of the case as to the justness of the act, the amount of work to be done, or fees fixed therefor, but solely on the question of the constitutionality of act No. 274 of the Acts of 1933. Since the adoption of the constitutional amendment which prohibits the Legislature from passing a local or special act, the Legislature cannot amend a local act, but it can repeal a local act, either entirely or only some particular part of it.”</p>

The prohibition, however, is to the salary only, and does not affect one whose compensation is not definite and fixed, but is uncertain in amount and consists in fees or percentages. 46 C. J. 1024, and cases cited in footnote 55. See also, <em>State </em>v.

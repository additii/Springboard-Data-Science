Const, art. I, § 22. Courtrooms may be closed only in certain limited circumstances. Today, we evaluate whether a potential obstacle to public access constituted a courtroom closure. The potential obstacle in this case was a sign that listed the courthouse hours. <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>Defendant Joey Andy argues that because the sign listed a specific closing time and his criminal trial proceedings continued after the listed closing time, the sign constituted a courtroom closure. However, the evidence shows that at all times during Andy’s trial proceedings, the door to the courthouse was unlocked and no member of the public was deterred from attending the proceedings by the sign. Therefore, we conclude that the sign did not constitute a courtroom closure and Andy’s public trial right was not violated.</p>

He appealed, claiming that his public trial right was violated when proceedings on some days continued after 4:00 p.m. despite the new 4:00 p.m. closing time for the courthouse. Pursuant to RAP 9.11, Andy moved to remand the case to the superior court to take “additional evidence to determine whether the courthouse doors were locked at 4 p.m. on the dates of the trial . . . and if so, whether that closure barred entry to the ongoing courtroom proceedings.” Mot. To Remand, No. 31018-3-III, at 1 (Wash. Ct. App. Mar. 5, 2013). The Court of Appeals commissioner granted the motion. As described below, the superior court entered findings of fact that the answer to both questions was no.</p>

Courthouse security personnel testified that the courthouse entrances and hours were restructured in October 2011 to address security and staffing issues. At that time, two entrances were closed and a permanent security station and metal detector were added to the remaining entrance. In addition, the board of county commissioners changed the courthouse hours to 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. for staffing reasons. The previous hours were 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.</p>

Second, at the end of each day, security would check every courtroom to make sure all trial proceedings had ended prior to locking the courthouse doors. If any courtroom was in session, the courthouse doors would remain open. Other mechanisms that courthouse security used to track whether court was in session were calling the court clerks to find out the estimated duration of ongoing proceedings and using security cameras to monitor whether a Department of Corrections transport vehicle was still on the premises.</p>

The officer testified that he was able to see anyone coming up to the entrance and had never seen a person read the sign and walk away without trying the door. The officer testified that “[t]here have been numerous times that somebody has walked up to the door, read the sign and walked right in regardless of what it said.” Id. at 126.

The transcript also shows that proceedings ended at 5:41 p.m. on one date (June 11, 2012). The time sheets for the on-duty security officer are consistent with those times. On the dates where proceedings ended between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., he worked until 5:00 p.m. He testified that per standard operating procedure, he kept the courthouse doors open until trial proceedings concluded on those days. On the date where proceedings ended at 5:41 p.m., his time sheet indicates that he worked overtime until 6:00 p.m. due to a trial in the courtroom of Judge Gibson (the trial judge in Andy’s trial). His time sheet also indicates that he locked the courthouse doors and checked out <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>of his station at 5:46 p.m., which is again consistent with Andy’s proceedings ending at 5:41 p.m. The officer testified that he did not have a specific recollection of that particular day, but based on routine procedures, the doors would not have been locked on that day until after Andy’s trial proceedings had ended at 5:41 p.m.</p>

In this case, eyewitnesses, including the victim, testified that Andy angrily entered a hotel room while carrying a knife and looking for his girlfriend, and cut the victim’s<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> face from her chin to her eye. This evidence is sufficient to support his convictions for assault and burglary.</p>

    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.6",340,[198,617,1250,692]]]'>¶23 First, Andy points to a statement in the transcript where his defense attorney acknowledged that he and the prosecutor had a conversation with a police officer outside in the hall regarding a teletype that the officer had received listing the charges for which Andy was being sought. Andy claims that this conversation violated his confrontation clause rights, his due process rights, and his right to be present at all important stages of the proceedings. Andy provides no authority for his contention that a defendant has the right to be present any time that his defense attorney interacts with a witness outside of the courtroom. He has not shown that the conversation violated any legal standard.</p>
    <p id="b340-6" data-blocks='[["BL_340.7",340,[197,1331,1247,736]]]'>¶24 Second, Andy argues that he should have been allowed to raise issues regarding the background of the witnesses to assist the jury in its credibility determination. He points to a portion of the transcript where he was not allowed to present evidence that many of the witnesses to the crime were arrested at the scene on various misdemeanor warrants. In that same transcript, his defense attorney agreed that such information is inadmissible because none of the crimes were felonies or crimes of dishonesty. This is a fairly straightforward application of ER 609, which allows evidence of criminal convictions only when the convictions are for crimes punishable by more than one year or that involve dishonesty. No error appears on this record.</p>

However, the trial judge specifically stated that if a witness had made prior inconsistent statements, it <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>would be admissible. Andy does not present any evidence to support his claim that he was not allowed to challenge witnesses that had made prior inconsistent statements.</p>

      <em>4. Abuse of Authority Claim</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b341-6" data-blocks='[["BL_341.6",341,[122,625,1251,254]]]'>¶26 Andy argues that the trial court abused its authority by allowing his conviction for burglary when — he claims— none of the witnesses were credible. This is simply a reformulation of his insufficiency of the evidence claim, and it fails for the same reasons discussed above.</p>
    <p id="b341-7" data-blocks='[["BL_341.7",341,[119,910,1259,855]]]'>¶27 Andy next argues that the trial court abused its authority when it asked the defense and prosecuting attorneys about the proper wording for the second degree assault jury instruction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The trial judge asked the two attorneys if they knew of any case law addressing whether the word “intentionally” needed to be included in the instruction, and then he asked that they “[g]ive it some thought” so they could discuss it later. 1 CDP at 29-30. Andy claims that by asking this question, the trial court abused its power and the judge should have sought the advice of the legislature, the attorney general, or the Supreme Court regarding the issue. Andy is incorrect. The trial judge appropriately handled a concern about the proper wording of jury instructions by asking the attorneys to look into the issue, with a final decision to be made later. There was no abuse of authority.</p>

In this case, the trial judge made findings of fact that the courthouse was open at all times during Andy’s trial and that the sign regarding courthouse hours <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>did not deter the public from attending Andy’s trial. Those findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence, including testimony by security officers. On this record, Andy has not shown that a closure occurred. We affirm his conviction.</p>

It is not and cannot be a fraud upon creditors for an insolvent debtor, who is a resident of this State and a head of a family, to purchase a home, within the constitutional area and value, out of his assets, upon which there is no existing lien.

C. Starr to his wife conveying his interest in their homestead to her. We think it practically imdisputed, and quite clear, after a careful reading of the testimony, that appellants acquired, occupied, and used the lots as their homestead. According to the undisputed evidence the lots are urban property, exceeding in value $2,500 and in area one-quarter of an acre; that the conveyances sought to be canceled were voluntary. Under these facts the creditors had no interest in or right to that part of said property constituting the homestead of appellants. There are no creditors, as far as a homestead is concerned, save those entitled to liens thereon under the Constitution. For this reason creditors cannot attack, as fraudulent, the conveyance of a homestead made without consideration and in bad faith as to them. <em>Fluke </em>v. <em>Sharum, </em><a href="/ark/118/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="118 Ark. 229" data-case-ids="1562536" data-case-paths="/ark/118/0229-01">118 Ark. 229</a>, and cases cited therein.

C. Starr to his wife and subjecting the excess over one-quarter of an acre contained in lots 7 and 8 to the payment of said debts. We cannot agree with learned counsel for appellants in this contention. It is true that F. C. Starr and Edith N. Starr testified that both lots were purchased with her individual money, and that none of his money was used in the purchase or improvement of them. We are convinced that this was the case in the purchase of lot 7, but are exceedingly doubtful whether lot 8 was purchased with her money. Mrs. Starr had an individual checking account in the First National Bank from the time they came to Fort Smith, some eight or nine years before she testified. It was her practice to pa}T her debts with checks on that bank. She made the two initial payments on lot 7 and a number of the payments to the Building &amp; Loan Association with checks, as was her custom. Not so when she came to buy lot 8. According to the evidence of herself and husband, she called in her neighbor, Mrs. W. S. Cochran, to count her money (or “boodle,” as she denominated it), and, not having enough to make the first payment, borrowed the deficiency from her friend, Mrs. W. S. Cochran. She was unable to say whether she had $200 or $250, and' could not tell how much she borrowed from Mrs. Cochran. She testified that she gave Mr. Starr the money to go down and buy the lot for her. When pressed, she was unable to make a satisfactory explanation as to why he had the deed made to the two of them instead of to her. She could not satisfactorily explain why he deeded Ms interest in lot 8 to her on May 10, 1921, only a few months before he failed, and in attempting to do so made several contradictory statements. Her attempted <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>explanation that lie deeded the lot to lier because it was paid for with her money was not plausible. He was not moved by an impulse of that kind at the time he bought the lot, else, when he paid her individual money for it, he would have taken the deed in her name. At the time he conveyed lot 8 to his wife his business was not prospering1, and, if not then insolvent, he was on the eve of bankruptcy. He conveyed lot 8 to her without consideration when indebted to the bank in the sum of $3,500. We are convinced that he made this conveyance with the purpose and intent of placing his property beyond the reach of his creditors. The chancellor found that said lot purchased by F. C. Starr was purchased with his own money, and, after a careful reading and consideration of the testimony, we are unable to say the finding was against a clear preponderance of evidence.</p>
    <p id="b442-3" data-blocks='[["BL_442.4",442,[311,1240,1196,253]]]'>The decree is therefore affirmed as to the excess over one-quarter of an acre, but reversed and remanded as to that portion of the lots claimed as a homestead, with directions to allow appellant to select one-quarter of an acre as exempt from the claims of appellees.</p>

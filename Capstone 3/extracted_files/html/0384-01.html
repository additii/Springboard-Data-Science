The record in that case also showed that 36 votes were casi in the manner provided by § 3777, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, of which number the contestant had received 26. Upon this state of the record, the contestant contended that he was entitled to be certified as the nominee, but, in overruling that contention, it was there said: “These returns may be impeached by any competent evidence showing that they are not true. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Nisler, </em><a href="/ark/179/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="179 Ark. 178" data-case-ids="8719700" data-case-paths="/ark/179/0178-01">179 Ark. 178</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20S.W.2d%20314" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="15 S.W.2d 314">15 S. W. (2d) 314</a>, it was held that the requirement of § 3777 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest that no person offering to vote-in a primary election shall be allowed to vote unless his name appears in the printed list of poll tax payers, required by § 3740, or unless he exhibits a poll tax receipt, or establishes that he has attained his majority since the last assessing time, is mandatory, and that its provisions must be substantially complied with. Bearing in mind that the official returns are <em>quasi </em>records and stand with all the force of presumptive regularity as held in the cases cited above until overcome by competent evidence, it will be readily seen that the contestant has not made out his case. All the ballots cast by the voters and returned by the proper officers are presumptively legal, and their verity is not impeached by showing that contestant received a majority of the votes cast by persons who had become of age since the last <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>assessing time. In order to succeed, lie must prove that he received a majority of all the legal ballots cast at the election. ’ ’</p>

Electors may have been eligible whose names were not included in the list provided for by § 3740, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest.</p>
    <p id="b413-6" data-blocks='[["BL_413.5",413,[191,887,1200,187]]]'>We therefore conclude that the complaint did not state a cause of action, and the demurrer was therefore properly sustained, and the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>

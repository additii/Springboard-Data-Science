The order was made in his character as a judge, and was in its nature judicial. Hence it did not make any difference whether Oslin declared himself in words to be acting as a court or not.</p>

And where a judge is authoifized to appoint a receiver, or perform other like judicial acts, it is held that his acts, orders, and proceedings, although had in vacation, are the judicial proceedings of the court whereof he is judge.

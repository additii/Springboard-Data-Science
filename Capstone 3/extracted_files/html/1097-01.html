On that date appellee Browning negligently ran into the car of Laird, damaging it to the extent of $2,800, which amount appellant paid to Laird, taking from him at the time (Oct. 6, 1927) a release, assignment, and agreement for subrogation.. It thereafter instituted this action to recover from both appellees the amount paid Laird, with interest. The recovery sought against appellee Standard Accident Insurance Company of Detroit, hereafter called the appellee, since Browning has no interest in the appeal, a default having been taken against him, is based on the ground that it and certain associate companies had issued a policy of automobile insurance to Browning, indemnifying him against loss imposed by law upon him for property damage resulting from accident for an amount not to exceed $1,000.</p>

The home office made the calculation, and sent the general agent its check for the amount which should thus be refunded. The general agent received the letter and check about July 10, and wrote the local representative at Jonesboro, inclosing the cheek in the sum of $73.25, and directing that the refund of unearned premium be made on the basis of charging at the pro rata rate as if the policy had been canceled under its terms on a pro rata basis, and that letter and check were received by the local agent, Latourette, at Jones-boro, on July 18, 1927.

The court entered a default judgment against Browning for $2,800, but as to appéllee found that its policy had been canceled prior to the accident, and dismissed the complaint for want of equity. This latter action of the court is challenged by this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b1120-2" data-blocks='[["BL_1120.3",1120,[304,373,1203,1900]]]'>
      <a id="p1102" href="#p1102" data-label="1102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1102</a>As appellant says, the sole question to he determined is whether the policy issued by appellee to Browning had been effectually canceled prior to the accident on July 18, 1927, so as to determine its liability thereunder. We agree with the trial court that it had, and that the cancellation became effective June 29,1927, nineteen days before the accident. Appellant’s counsel says that this cancellation-was conditioned upon Latourette’s securing Browning another policy in the New Amsterdam Company, and that therefore the cancellation did not become effective until such a policy was secured. We- do not so understand the agreed statement of facts. The Railroad Commission demanded that this policy be taken down and another be substituted complying with act 99 of 1927,-and, at Browning’s request, Latourette wrote the commission for the policy, which was sent to him, and on June 29 they agreed that it should toe canceled, so indorsed it, and sent it to the general agent in Little Rock, requesting to be advised as to basis of refund, whether short term or pro rata. The home office, on request, advised the settlement would toe made on a pro rata basis, which, was the more favorable to Browning. Now, Browning desired other insurance, and an application was made to the New Amsterdam Company through Latourette, not as agent for said company (which he was not), but as agent for Browning, who directed him to collect the unearned premium from appellee and apply it, so far as it would go, on the premium in the other company. There was no provision making the. cancellation of the policy issued by appellee dependent on securing other insurance. There was no agreement by Latourette binding him to obtain other insurance, but only to try to place the liability with another company. Under such conditions it cannot be said that the cancellation was conditional, and the case of <em>Ætna Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Rosenberg, </em><a href="/ark/62/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="62 Ark. 507" data-case-ids="1905685" data-case-paths="/ark/62/0507-01">62 Ark. 507</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20S.W.%20908" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="36 S.W. 908">36 S.

Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em><a href="/ark/62/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="62 Ark. 382" data-case-ids="1905713" data-case-paths="/ark/62/0382-01">62 Ark. 382</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20S.W.%201101" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="35 S.W. 1101">35 S. W. 1101</a>. But it is also the general rule that the parties may agree to a cancellation at any time, with or without an actual refund of unearned premium. Payment or tender of the unearned premium may be waived by the insured by agreement to cancel and voluntary surrender of the policy for cancellation. 'Cooley’s Briefs on Insurance, 2 ed., vol. 5, pp. 4604, 4615. In 14 R. C. L., page 1012, it is said: ‘ ‘ The right of the insured to the return of the premium as a condition precedent to a cancellation may be waived, and is waived when the validity of the cancellation is acquiesced in by the insured, as by his voluntary and unconditional surrender of the policy upon receiving the notice of cancellation.” See also cases cited in note to above text, and <a href="/citations/?q=13%20L.R.A.N.S.%20889" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="13 L.R.A.N.S. 889">13 L. R. A. (N. S.), 889</a>, and note, But here appellee did not request cancellation nor give notice, and canceled only at request of insured because, he desired to continue operating cars for hire in compliance with law.</p>
    <p id="b1121-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1121.4",1121,[163,1466,1200,658]]]'>Neither is any public interest involved, as the Railroad Commission, the agency established by law representing the public interest, demanded that this policy be taken down and another complying with the statute substituted. It may be that the commission could have prevented Browning from operating his cars for hire during the interim between the surrender of the policy in question and the receipt of another in due form, a question not decided, but it could not compel appellee to change the conditions of its policy in compliance with an act passed subsequent to the date of issue, nor to assume other or different obligations. So it requested the policy to be withdrawn.</p>
    <p id="b1121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1121.5",1121,[163,2140,1199,146]]]'>Other questions are argued by appellant, but we find it unnecessary to discuss them. The decree of the court was correct, and is affirmed.</p>

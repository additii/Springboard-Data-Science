The son then went into the house and gave the summons to the defendant. The court held that the plaintiff failed to comply strictly with New York’s personal service statute requiring “delivering the summons within the state to the person to be served.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=505%20N.Y.S.2d%20591" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="505 N.Y.S.2d 591">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=505%20N.Y.S.2d%20591" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="505 N.Y.S.2d 591">at 594</a>. The language of the New York statute is materially indistinguishable from the language of Washington’s service of process statute, ROW 4.28.080(15); the secondhand, hand-to-hand delivery in this New York case is also materially indistinguishable from the secondhand, hand-to-hand delivery in our case. The New York court held that “delivery of a summons to the wrong person does not confer jurisdiction over defendant, even though the summons shortly thereafter comes into the possession of the <a id="p855" href="#p855" data-label="855" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*855</a>party to be served.” <em>Macchia, </em><a href="/ny-2d/67/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="67 N.Y.2d 592" data-case-ids="4403305" data-case-paths="/ny-2d/67/0592-01">67 N.Y.2d at 594</a>.

    <p id="b897-4" data-blocks='[["BL_897.4",897,[113,491,1251,754]]]'>¶39 An earlier New York case also supports Townsend’s argument. <em>McDonald v.

In <em>McDonald, </em>the court held that delivery of the summons to a receptionist in the building where the defendant foreign corporation’s salesman had an office, and where the receptionist was not the corporation’s employee, did not confer jurisdiction over the defendant, even though the receptionist delivered the summons to the proper person. <em>Id. </em>at 114-15. The court in <em>McDonald </em>distinguished between whether “the [original] process server has acted reasonably in placing the summons within reach of the defendant,” <em>id. </em>at 115, and cases where the process server left the summons with someone at a distance farther from the defendant.</p>

      <em>Brown-Edwards, </em>no authority requires the process server’s consent. And a process server need not reside with the defendant to serve her personally.

    <p id="b898-4" data-blocks='[["BL_898.4",898,[197,754,1252,845]]]'>¶42 Based on the language of both RCW 4.28.080(15) and CR 4, Townsend fails to rebut by clear and convincing evidence Scanlan’s contention that Townsend’s father served her personally. Townsend’s father was competent to serve Townsend. He delivered a copy of the summons and complaint personally to Townsend within the statute of limitations. Townsend’s deposition testimony and her attorney’s stipulation demonstrated proof of service in compliance with CR 4(g)(5) and (7). <em>See Hamill v.

The Department of Labor and Industries (Department) denied Rowley’s claim because it determined that Rowley was in<a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>jured while committing a felony: possession of a controlled substance. The Industrial Insurance Act (IIA), Title 51 RCW, bars payment of workers’ compensation under that circumstance. RCW 51.32.020. Rowley filed a notice of appeal to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (Board). After considering testimony from several witnesses, an industrial appeals judge (IAJ) found that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the Department’s decision and ordered the Department to approve Rowley’s claim.</p>

Rowley was severely injured<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> when his truck-trailer veered off a highway overpass and landed on the roadway below. The accident occurred midday on a clear and dry day. Suspecting that drug use might have been a contributing factor, law enforcement sent Officer Donevan Dexheimer, a trained drug recognition officer, to Harborview hospital, where Rowley was treated after the accident. At Harborview, an emergency room (ER) nurse provided Officer Dexheimer with a “baggie” that she said had come from Rowley’s pocket. The baggie contained residue that Officer Dexheimer believed to be methamphetamine. Officer Dexheimer also had Rowley’s blood drawn and submitted to the Washington State Toxicology Laboratory (Lab) for testing.</p>

He called only two witnesses: himself and the office manager for his employer. Consistent with WAC 263-12-115(2)(c), the Department then presented its case in chief. It called six witnesses: Officer Dexheimer; Brian Capron, a forensic specialist from the Lab; Washington State Trooper David Roberts, the first responder to Rowley’s accident; Washington State Trooper Nicholas King; Mary Comstock, a nurse who treated Rowley in the ER; and Jennifer Compton, another ER nurse who treated Rowley.</p>
    <p id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.4",246,[202,953,1251,576]]]'>¶8 The office manager for Rowley’s employer testified that Rowley was working when the accident occurred. She thus provided evidence of injury during the course of employment. Rowley testified that he was in a coma for 40 days after the accident and could not remember anything about the events leading up to it. But he also testified that he had taken random drug tests many times over the course of his employment and was not aware of ever testing positive. He thus presented some evidence from which an inference could be drawn that he did not possess drugs at the time of his accident.</p>
    <p id="b246-5" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[201,1561,1253,638]],["BL_247.1",247,[201,345,1248,949]]]'>¶9 The Department then called Officer Dexheimer; he testified that he was trained to identify both signs of impairment and types of drugs. He also testified about his interactions with nurses treating Rowley. He stated that a nurse (either Nurse Comstock or Nurse Compton) told him that Rowley “had a quote/unquote ‘surprise’ in his pocket when he arrived.” CP at 737. Officer Dexheimer explained that he could not perform a field sobriety test on Rowley because Rowley was unconscious, but that he measured Rowley’s pulse, listened to the conversations occurring between the treating nurses, and got Nurse Comstock to help him find Rowley’s clothes and a baggie with some <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>suspected methamphetamine residue in it. Rowley’s pulse was normal, but Officer Dexheimer testified that he believed this was unusual because hospital staff had given Rowley morphine and Valium. Under those circumstances, Officer Dexheimer considered Rowley’s pulse high, possibly indicating use of a central nervous system stimulant prior to the accident. On one hand, Officer Dexheimer testified that he could not form an opinion about whether Rowley was impaired by drug use because he could not perform a proper field sobriety test. On the other hand, he testified that “coming down” from stimulants could cause a person to fall asleep at the wheel and that this might explain Rowley’s accident. CP at 751. He also stated that he arrested Rowley for driving under the influence of an intoxicant (DUI) (while Rowley was unconscious in the hospital), and he opined that the accident “more likely than not” occurred because Rowley was affected by methamphetamine. CP at 754.</p>
    <p id="b247-4" data-blocks='[["BL_247.4",247,[202,1324,1246,206]]]'>¶10 Officer Dexheimer also testified that he asked Nurse Comstock where the baggie was and that she told him Rowley’s clothes and the baggie were both in the trash. He related the following exchange with Nurse Comstock:</p>
    <blockquote id="b247-5" data-blocks='[["BL_247.5",247,[247,1564,1202,340]]]'>So she pointed out - We looked through the garbage bag that was actually still in the room, and it was nearly empty.

I can’t remember whether she actually physically handed it to me or just said, “That’s the one. That’s it.”</blockquote>

    <p id="b248-4" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[201,526,1248,594]]]'>¶12 On cross-examination, Officer Dexheimer explained that, according to his police report, hospital staff had washed the contents of the baggie down the sink before he arrived at Harborview. He stated that although Nurse Comstock found the baggie in the trash for him, he believed that a different staff member originally discovered the baggie. He also testified that he might have written the wrong date in his accident report and the wrong name on the blood vials (“Rawley” instead of Rowley), CP at 765, that he did not test the baggie or take a sample from the hospital sink, and that coffee can raise a person’s heart rate. CP at 766-67.</p>

He explained that the Lab’s analysts noted that discrepancy and then tested the blood. Capron testified that the blood tested positive for high levels of methamphetamine. He also testified that he believed it was more probable than not that Rowley was impaired by methamphetamine when his truck went off the road.</p>

She explained that when a trauma patient like Rowley comes into the ER, his or her clothing is cut off either before or upon arrival. She also stated that when ER staff cut clothing from a patient, they search it for valuables, lock up any valuables that are found, and dispose of any other items.

    <p id="b252-4" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[201,633,1253,854]]]'>¶23 Second, the opinion held that the Department must prove the commission or attempt of a felony by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. It acknowledged that the normal standard in IIA appeals is the preponderance of the evidence standard, but it concluded that felony payment bar appeals were different for two reasons: (1) the felony payment bar “deprive [s] the worker of benefits to which he or she would otherwise be entitled but for the allegation of wicked conduct” and (2) an adverse determination exposes the worker to significant financial and reputational consequences and possibly even criminal prosecution. CP at 14.

It explained that while the evidence showed that Rowley likely used methamphetamine, this was not dispositive because driving under the influence is only a gross misdemeanor. It further explained that while possession is a felony, the evidence that Rowley actually possessed methamphetamine in the truck was not clear, cogent, and convincing. It cited Officer Dexheimer’s failure to explain why he believed the residue in the baggie was methamphetamine, the chain of custody problems involving the baggie, and Officer King’s failure to explain why his field test was reliable or how that test could reveal both ecstasy and methamphetamine.</p>

RCW 51.52.115 provides that the Board’s decision is presumed correct on appeal; RCW 51.52.050(2)(a) contains no such provision. And while RCW 51.52.050(2)(a) provides that the appellant bears only the burden to come forward with a “prima facie case for the relief sought” on appeal, RCW 51.52.115 places the “burden of proof” squarely on the appellant. Nevertheless, this court has held that an appellant can meet the burden imposed under RCW 51.52.115 just by showing that the Department’s order is not supported by sufficient evidence—that is, without necessarily presenting any new <em>affirmative </em>evidence that the Department’s order is incorrect. <em>Olympia Brewing, </em>34 Wn.2d at 506.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Given the difference in lan<a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>guage summarized above, RCW 51.52.050(2)(a) cannot possibly impose a greater evidentiary burden on an aggrieved party.</p>

But we have previously interpreted the intentional injury portion of RCW 51.32.020 to place just such a burden on the claimant. In <em>Mercer v. Department of Labor &amp; Industries, </em>we explained:</p>
    <blockquote id="b269-5" data-blocks='[["BL_269.5",269,[247,992,1201,294]]]'>[I]n view of the statutory language [in RCW 51.32.020] precluding recovery if the workman’s death results from his own deliberate intention to take his life, we have allowed recovery <em>only </em>where [the claimant presents] competent medical evidence establish [ing] that the decedent acted under an incontrollable impulse or while in a delirium.</blockquote>

In other words, in <em>Mercer, </em>applying RCW 51.32.020, we imposed the requirement that the claimant must prove a negative—that the deceased’s taking his own life was <em>not </em>the result of his deliberate intentional act. I see no reason why we should retreat from imposing the same requirement when applying another portion of the same statute in the present case. While the majority maintains that requiring the claimant here to “prove a negative” is unfair, majority at 205, we have already imposed that burden in the even more difficult context of a person who is deceased. <em>See Mercer, </em>74 Wn.2d at 101.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">13</a> Indeed, placing the burden on the claimant here would promote uniformity and predictability in application of the IIA.</p>

Majority at 205. But again, the approach that comports with our case law “dictates” that the burden here, which concerns the claimant’s establishing his right to benefits, should be borne by the claimant. <em>See, e.g., Knight v.

    <p id="b657-4" data-blocks='[["BL_657.4",657,[184,563,1202,396]]]'>An insured engaged in the commission of a felony who, when discovered in .the act, becomes the aggressor in an effort to shoot his way out, necessarily takes chances on being killed, and, if killed in an effort to escape, his death cannot be regarded as accidental within the terms of such policy. He oug’ht to have anticipated or expected death from his own culpability, and hence, if killed, his death is not accidental.</p>
    <p id="b657-5" data-blocks='[["BL_657.5",657,[185,983,1201,1274]]]'>Appellant contends, however, for a reversal of the judgment because Huston made a statement within 48 hours after the killing to the effect that he accidentally killed Price while he was trying to shoot the .45 caliber automatic pistol out of his hand. H. O. Davis testified that Huston made such a statement to him-. Huston denied making the statement. Appellant argues that, on account of the conflict in the testimony between Huston and Davis, the court should have allowed the jury to determine the issue of whether the killing was intentional or accidental. Even if it be conceded that Huston was impeached so that the jury would have disregarded his testimony, yet the facts detailed above, were supported by other undisputed evidence, especially by the testimony of Pate; or, to state it differently, if the-testimony of Huston were entirely eliminated from this record, the remaining undisputed evidence showed that, while Price was engaged in the commission of a felony; he was discovered, and, in order to escape arrest, he opened fire upon the officers and continued to fire upon them until he was killed by them in necessary self-defense. The court, therefore, correctly told the jury that it was shown by the undisputed evidence that Price deliberately brought on his own death; hence that his death was not accidental within the meaning of the policy.</p>

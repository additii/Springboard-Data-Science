According to his testimony, he had lived in Arkadelphia and practiced law there for the past thirty years. The lot in controversy is on one of the principal streets of the town, and has been vacant for the past ten or fifteen years. W. G. Pannell formerly owned the lot and had a blacksmith’s shop on it. He left Arkadelphia about thirty years ago, but has made a good many visits back there, and always claimed the lot in controversy. A son of W. G. Pannell operated the blacksmith shop for a number o.f years after his father left Arkadelphia. In September, 1920, Wilson obtained a quitclaim deed from W. G. Pannell to the lot and paid him $500 for it. Wilson considered this a fair value for the lot. He knew that the defendant had not been divorced from her husband and had not relinquished her dower in the lot at the time he purchased it. Wilson did not know, however, that Mrs. Pannell claimed title to the. lot at the time he purchased it. Pannell told Wilson that his wife would not join him in the deed.</p>

When her husband left, she took possession of the blacksmith shop on the lot in controversy, and two of her children worked in the shop. At the time her husband left, her children were respectively 19, 17, and 12 years of age. Mrs. Pannell also kept boarders and paid the debts of her husband, amounting to between $800. and $1,000. She paid these debts to keep her husband’s creditors from attaching the lot in controversy. After doing so, she had the <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>lot assessed in her own name and paid the taxes on it for twenty-four years.

The judgment of the circuit court sustaining Mrs. Pannell’s plea of <em>res judicata </em>was correct. A comparison of the statement of facts made by the court in the suit brought in equity by Wilson against Mrs. Pannell to quiet his title to the lot with t.lie statement of facts in the present case will show that they are in all essential respects the same.</p>

    <p id="b48-6" data-blocks='[["BL_48.7",48,[302,1132,1198,667]]]'>“Appellant insists that the court erred in dismissing his bill for want of equity. This must depend upon whether his grantor, W. G. Pannell, was in position to assert his legal title as against the equitable rights of Mrs. S. A. Pannell in a court of equity, for appellant cannot be regarded as an innocent purchaser, as the record reflects that he had a personal acquaintance with his grantor, W. G. Pannell, and-the appellee, Mrs. S. A. Pannell, and understood that they had lived apart for twenty-three years; that said appellee had been in the actual possession of the lot during that period, paying taxes thereon and claiming ownership thereto.” <em>Wilson </em>v.

This was not done, however, because the court was of the opinion that the equitable title was not in her, but relief was denied her on the specific ground that her husband had not been made a party to the suit, and that therefore it was a technical error for the court below to quiet the title in her.</p>
    <p id="b48-8" data-blocks='[["BL_48.9",48,[309,2249,1192,98]],["BL_49.1",49,[104,408,1197,203]]]'>As above stated, however, the court held in the equity case that Mrs. Pannell had the equitable title to <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>the lot, and for that reason denied the prayer of Wilson to have his title quieted, holding that he was not an innocent purchaser and had no greater right in .the lot than his grantor, the husband of Mrs. Pannell.</p>

In short, it would do no.good to hold that the equitable title to the lot was in Mrs. Pannell, if she could not interpose it to a legal as well as equitable suit for the property against one who had purchased the lot from her husband with full knowledge of her rights.</p>

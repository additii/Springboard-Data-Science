R. C. S. Beqwn, one of the circuit judges. Rogers sued Mayers on three bonds, each dated 7th May, 1840, each for $1,666 86, due respectively at one, two, and three years, each expressed to be in part payment of lot 6, in block 1, in Fort Smith, Mayers pleaded four pleas: The two first set up as a defence, that when the bonds were given, Rogers executed his bond to Mayers in the sum of $10,000 of same date, conditioned that he would execute a deed for the lot, provided Mayers should first pay off and satisfy the bonds given for the purchase money, and'that Rogers had not made or tendered such deed. The third plea was of payment of interest, to which there was issue. The fourth plea was a plea of set-off, to which was replication and issue. Demurrer to first and second pleas sustained, and trial on the others by the court; which found the interest paid up to- the day alleged, and not set-off, and rendered judgment accordingly. Mayers brought error.</p>

Indeed, by the express terms of the agreement, Rogers is not bound to convey 'the lot sold until the purchase money is first paid by Mayers. The payment of the money is a condition precedent, and must be performed before a conveyance can be demanded. The law binds every man to perform his contract according to its true intent and meaning. Here Mayers agreed to pay the full amount of the purchase money, although due at different times, before Rogers ■was to eonvey the premises, and consequently he cannot avoid his contract by resisting the payment, upon the ground that Rogers had not conveyed. Judgment affirmed.</p>

W. (2d) 753</a>, is cited as conferring authority to sue the State. But such is not its effect. The facts in that case were that the Highway Commission, in constructing a bridge across the White River in Jackson County, had damaged Campbell’s property adjacent thereto. The Highway Commission brought no suit to condemn the property, but was sued by Campbell, the property owner, for the damage caused by building the bridge. We construed this damage as a taking <a id="p1064" href="#p1064" data-label="1064" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1064</a>of the property to the extent of the damage, and we held that, while the Statevcould take or damage property in the construction of its road system, pursuant to the right of eminent domain, this, right could be exercised only upon compensation made to the property owner.</p>
    <p id="b1084-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1084.4",1084,[297,613,1202,1012]]]'>We treated the bridge as a part of the State’s highway system and the damage to the plaintiff’s property resulting from its construction as a part of the construction cost, which might be paid out of money borrowed and appropriated by the State for that purpose.

W. (2d) 879</a>), under which contractors were allowed to sue the Commission to enforce their express contracts, was held applicable to the implied contract to pay damages resulting from building the bridge and thereby damaging the plaintiff’s private property. In other words, 'the damage to the plaintiff’s property in the Campbell case, <em>supra, </em>was a construction cost, for which the owner had the right to sue the Highway Commission. It was there pointed out that § 22 of the bill of rights provides that private property shall not be taken, appropriated or damaged for public use without just compensation therefor, and it was held, in effect, as we have just said, that damaging the property was a taking of it for a public use to the extent of the damage.</p>

The State was without power to condemn and take possession of the bridge without compensating the owners therefor, and the judgment of condemnation could not have been enforced until the compensation to which it adjudged the owner to be entitled had been paid. In the condemnation proceedings the owners made no demand for cash paid down, but expressly consented and agreed to accept the solemn pledge of the State to assume and pay the outstanding bonds as they matured. It is not to be doubted that the sovereign State will ultimately discharge the obligation. Conditions not at all peculiar to this State, and of which all persons have knowledge, render the discharge of the obligation impossible in the time and manner contemplated when the property was condemned. But, <a id="p1065" href="#p1065" data-label="1065" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1065</a>even so, the State acquired, and now has, title to the'property, and the former owners have the obligation of the State to pay, and we must therefore hold, notwithstanding the equities of the case, that these former owners have no right to have a receiver appointed to take possession of property owned by the State.</p>

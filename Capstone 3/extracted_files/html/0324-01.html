U.S. Const, amend. VI. This confrontation right is often implicated when statements made outside of court are later presented at trial by someone other than the original speaker because the defendant cannot cross-examine the original speaker about the statements. However, the United States Supreme Court has held that not all out-of-court statements give rise to the protections of the confrontation right because not all speakers are acting as a “witness” against the accused as described in the Sixth Amendment. <em>Crawford v.

Today, petitioner Troy Wilcoxon asks us to find that his confrontation right was violated when his codefendant’s out-of-court statement was admitted at trial and Wilcoxon did not have the opportunity to cross-examine his codefendant.

Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Jan. 7, 2014) at 118 (Vol. A). The State’s theory of the case was that the purpose of inviting Glasson and the other casino employees to the Candy Store was to get them out of Lancer Lanes so the burglary could occur without any interference. The group arrived around midnight, but Wilcoxon left by himself less than an hour later after talking privately with Nollette. Shortly after 2:00 a.m., the Candy Store’s surveillance footage showed Nollette talking on his cell phone with someone—the conversation lasted roughly 15 minutes. Cell phone records showed several calls between Nollette and Wilcoxon around 2:00 a.m. Wilcoxon’s phone’s signal relied on a cell tower near Lancer Lanes. Soon after Nollette’s <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>conversation ended, Nollette, Glasson, and the two casino employees left the Candy Store.</p>

Wilcoxon and Nollette both appeared “excited.” VRP (Jan. 9, 2014) at 503 (Vol. C). Bomar testified that Wilcoxon discussed going to Lancer Lanes and “getting away with it,” referring to the Lancer Lanes burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 504-05. Bomar testified that Wil-coxon described to him how he had burglarized Lancer Lanes, including that he had entered through the back door, disabled the security cameras, and used keys to access the money drawer.

In contrast, <em>Roberts </em>declared that certain hearsay—admissible under a hearsay exception—nonetheless violates the confrontation clause because it is unreliable. Therefore, the interlocking nature of the codefendants’ confessions—much like the interlocking nature of Nollette’s and Wilcoxon’s alleged confessions—was relevant to whether a codefendant’s statement could be admitted against the defendant, but not relevant to the prejudice of putting an inadmissible statement before the jury in a joint trial.

If Nollette and Wilcoxon had been tried separately, it would have been error for the trial judge to allow the prosecutor to introduce Nollette’s inadmissible confession at Wilcoxon’s trial. Evidence that would be inadmissible in a severed trial should not be put before the jury in a joint trial solely because the confrontation clause would not bar its admission against the defendant under a hearsay exception.

B Verbatim Report of Proceeding (VRP) at 303-07, 312 (Jan. 8, 2014). In closing argument, the State relied heavily on Solem’s testimony regarding the “friend.” <em>See, </em>e.g., D VRP at 687 (Jan. 10, 2014) (“When his friend asked him, what— what place would you hit? He not only recommended a casino, he recommended [Lancer Lanes].”), 690 (“[I]sn’t it interesting that [Eric Bomar] comes into nearly $15,000, and isn’t that the number that Mr. Nollette specifically mentioned to Mr. Solem when he was saying that his friend owed a guy money and he stated it was $15,000?”), 689 (“Remember, he told Mr. Solem, my friend committed the burglary, he called me while the burglary was being committed.”). In the State’s rebuttal closing argument, when referring to Solem’s testimony, the prosecutor argued, “And the big thing: only <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>one person called Mr. Nollette. Mr. Nollette said he got a call from the burglar during the commission of the crime. There’s only one person that called Mr. Nollette during the time of the burglary.” <em>Id. </em>at 734. The State repeatedly hammered home the point that Solem testified that Nollette said he received a phone call from his friend. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>id. </em>at 744 (“he gets a call from his friend saying, hey, dude, I’m in [Lancer Lanes] and I’m doing it”; “[h]e tells [Solem] I got a call from my friend while he was committing the burglary”); <em>see also id. </em>at 732, 736, 742. It is clear that Solem’s testimony greatly strengthened the State’s case.</p>

However, I cannot say that the inconsistent testimony of an initial suspect, given under threat of being prosecuted himself, and guided by the State’s leading questions, would lead any jury to necessarily find Wilcoxon guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the defense elicited testimony regarding evidence of three other suspects who may have been the burglar captured on the surveillance footage. It is Nollette’s confession implicating Wilcoxon that gives strength to Bomar’s testimony.</p>

The lead opinion says that Nollette’s statements to Solem “merely corroborated the cell phone calls that Wilcoxon made to Nollette during the time of the burglary.” Lead opinion at 336. “[T]hese calls were already circumstantially corroborated by the surveillance video and the cell phone records.” <em>Id. </em>This too is not supported by the record. Sergeant Muszynski testified that three phone calls between Wilcoxon and Nollette took place during the burglary: one at 1:59 a.m. lasting 84 seconds, one at 2:07 a.m. lasting 69 seconds, and one at 2:08 a.m. lasting 74 seconds. That is almost four minutes of call time, one-third of the <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>total time the suspect was in the casino. Sergeant Mus-zynski also testified to the three surveillance cameras that recorded the burglary. At no point during the burglary is the suspect seen holding or speaking on a cell phone. Only Nollette’s improperly admitted statements combined with the cell phone records allow the jury to conclude that the man behind the garbage bag—who the surveillance video never shows talking on a phone—was Wilcoxon.</p>
    <p id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[197,780,1257,997]]]'>¶79 Unlike the remaining untainted evidence in <em>Guloy, Hieb, Watt, Anderson, Lui, </em>and <em>Harrington, </em>we do not have such “overwhelming untainted evidence” here. Without Nollette’s confession, the State’s case against Wilcoxon is “woven from circumstantial <em>evidence.” Harrington, </em><a href="/us/395/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="202" data-cite="395 U.S. 250" data-case-ids="1771609" data-case-paths="/us/395/0250-01">395 U.S. at 254</a>. Nollette’s confession adds credibility to Bomar’s testimony and strengthens the fabric of the remaining circumstantial evidence. As the lead opinion points out, “[B]efore a constitutional error can be harmless, the State must show ‘beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.’ ” Lead opinion at 335 (quoting <em>Chapman, </em><a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="203" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">386 U.S. at 24</a>). Admittedly, there is some evidence remaining against Wilcoxon. However, the test is not that of “some” evidence of guilt, or even “a lot” of evidence of guilt; it must be “overwhelming.” Anything less than overwhelming evidence of guilt runs the risk of invading the province of the jury, a concern we articulated in <em>State v.

Because of these distinctly different concerns and the protections that evolved in the case law to guard against them, I would hold that <em>Bruton </em>and its progeny remain good law, applicable even to nontestimonial statements.</p>

        <em> </em>Circuit courts, on the other hand, have interpreted <em>Gray </em>such that the use of a neutral pronoun in lieu of a redaction satisfies <em>Bruton. </em>For example, the Sixth Circuit, in <em>United States v. Winston, </em>acknowledged that “several of our sister circuits have noted that a <em>Bruton </em>violation can be avoided by replacing the co-defendant’s name with a neutral pronoun or other generalized phrase." <a href="/f-appx/55/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="219" data-cite="55 F. App'x 289" data-case-ids="1051233" data-case-paths="/f-appx/55/0289-01">55 F. App’x 289</a>, 294 (6th Cir. 2003). I would decline to adopt the bright line rule of some circuit courts that a neutral pronoun always satisfies <em>Bruton, </em>and hold that whatever the form of the redaction, it must be clear that the redaction does not obviously refer to the defendant.</p>

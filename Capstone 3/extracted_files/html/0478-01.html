V. Accordingly, voluntary statements made by a criminal defendant can be admitted at trial but compelled statements cannot. In this case, defendants were forced to choose between making incriminating statements and facing physical violence. Those incriminating statements were then used <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>against the defendants at trial.

They saw a silver Ford Taurus drive by. Thinking that the car belonged to a friend, Cardenas’s cousin flashed a sign associated with their gang at the car. The car did not belong to a friend, and after driving by, it made a U-turn and drove by the house again. Several shots were then fired from the car, hitting Cardenas. He survived, but lost one of his kidneys.</p>

He lost sight of the car, but then caught sight of a car that he believed to be the same silver Taurus. He continued following the car and notified the police that he was following the car that had been involved in the shooting. The police caught up and began chasing the Taurus as well. At one point, an officer following the Taurus saw an object fly past his car window that he thought might be a gun; another officer indicated that he saw it fly from the window of the silver Taurus. The police eventually put out spike strips and were able to stop the Taurus. Some officers then returned to search the area where the officers observed the object being thrown from the Taurus, but they did not find anything.</p>

His brother, Ricardo DeLeon, was in the back seat, and their friend Octavio Robledo was in the front passenger seat. In the car, police found two red bandanas, cans of beer, and marijuana paraphernalia, but no guns or shell casings. The three were arrested and each charged with three counts <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>of first degree assault while armed with a firearm with an intent to benefit a criminal street gang.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[201,463,1248,470]]]'>¶5 The three were tried together as codefendants. The State’s theory of the case was that the shooting was gang related. The victim, Cardenas, is a member of the Little Valley Locos/Locotes gang, which is affiliated with the larger Sureño gang. Sureño-affiliated gangs generally wear blue, and they are rivals of the Norteño-affiliated gangs, who generally wear red. The State argued that the three defendants were affiliated with a Norteño-affiliated gang, and that the shooting was a gang-related act of retaliation.</p>
    <p id="b536-5" data-blocks='[["BL_536.5",536,[202,955,1252,530]]]'>¶6 Prior to trial, the judge ruled that he would allow a gang expert to testify regarding gangs and how they operate in general (as opposed to evidence specific to this case) because it was relevant to motive, but repeatedly indicated that it should be narrow and focused. At trial, Officer Jose Ortiz (who also testified as a fact witness regarding his investigation into this particular shooting) gave extensive testimony as a gang expert. Defendants argue that much of his gang expert testimony was irrelevant and prejudicial. Therefore, we review his testimony in considerable detail.</p>

He described their hand signs as “basically a form of American Sign Language.” <em>Id. </em>at 1922. He explained that gang members must “put[ ] in work,” which can include “burglaries, vehicle prowls, go [ing] out there mobbing, cruising around, flying your colors, throwing out gang signs, intimidating, causing assaults.” <em>Id. </em>at 1922-23. He testified that if a gang member did not “put[ ] in work,” the gang hierarchy will “order[ ] a hit on [them]” and “beat [them] down.” <em>Id. </em>at 1927. He explained that in order to join a gang, one must be <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>“jumped in,” which is essentially a “beat down.” 7c/. at 1923. Officer Ortiz testified that the leader of the gang “califs] the shots” from prison and that had “always been the structure.” <em>Id. </em>at 1927, 1929. He also explained that gang members get “certain credibility” and “certain influence” from serving time in prison. <em>Id. </em>at 1929. He went on to say that “ft]hey do some really, really bad crimes out there, whether they get caught or not.” <em>Id. </em>at 1930. But he also said that gang members did not necessarily have to serve prison time to get credibility, and that one could “establish your reputation by your actions out here on the street.” <em>Id. </em>He went on to say that the top priority for gang members is to “gain respect,” which is accomplished by “going out there doing the assaults, the burglaries, the robberies, the intimi-dations, the threats, the harassments.” <em>Id. </em>at 1931-32. He testified that “for them, they equate fear with respect.” <em>Id. </em>at 1932. He explained that a response to disrespect would include anything from “immediately posturing” and “fighting right on the spot” to “shootings and homicides.” <em>Id. </em>at 1933. He also stated that gangs now use the Internet to recruit new members and to intimidate and harass rivals. <em>Id. </em>at 1939-40.</p>

In particular, they noted that nothing in this case had anything to do with joining a gang or any imprisoned leader ordering a shooting. The trial judge denied the motion, opining that any prejudice was “created by them” (referring to the defendants) and that the evidence was “appropriate to the case.” 13 CDP (Oct. 20, 2010) at 1998.</p>

Corrections Corporal Gabino Saenz of the Sunnyside jail testified that he is tasked with determining where to safely house new inmates. Many factors go <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>into this determination, including whether someone might be targeted for violence because of age, gang involvement, or mental illness. As part of the booking process, a corrections officer fills out a “Gang Documentation Form” if an inmate indicates that there is someone that they cannot be safely housed with. 7 CDP (Oct. 8, 2010) at 1139, 1167. Importantly, the form is filled out <em>only </em>if the individual cannot be safely housed with someone else.</p>
    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[202,795,1246,530]]]'>¶10 In the Sunnyside jail, the primary groups that have to be housed separately are Norteños and Sureños. When going through the intake process, Ricardo DeLeon indicated that he was affiliated with a Norteños gang but that he was not active. Anthony DeLeon and Octavio Robledo both indicated affiliation with a Norteño gang. All three indicated they could not be safely housed with Sureños. The defense attorneys objected to admission of these defendants’ statements regarding gang affiliation gathered through this process, but the trial judge allowed it.</p>

The Court of Appeals largely rejected their claims, but found that the trial court had erred in two ways. First, the Court of Appeals found that some of the generalized gang evidence that the trial judge allowed was irrelevant, “had little or no probative value,” and was not appropriately limited. <em>Id. </em>at 196. The Court of Appeals expressed concern with the court’s admission of generalized gang evidence and “remind [ed] trial courts that ER 403 has particular impor<a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>tance in assessing the admissibility of generalized evidence regarding the behavior of gangs and gang members.” <em>Id. </em>at 197. However, the Court of Appeals ultimately concluded that the additional generalized gang evidence was unlikely to have materially affected the outcome of the trial, and upheld all three convictions. <em>Id.</em>

    <p id="b539-4" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[201,677,1248,1070]]]'>¶13 Second, the Court of Appeals found that the trial court erred when it ruled that the defendants’ statements regarding gang affiliation on the jail intake forms were voluntary for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 204-05. The Court of Appeals explained that “the State’s own trial evidence demonstrated that there was a real and ongoing danger of violence and retaliation between rival gangs that presented these defendants with a credible threat of harm if housed with rival gang members in the Sunnyside jail.” <em>Id. </em>at 204. As a result, the statements were made by the defendants to avoid a very real risk of danger, and thus were not made voluntarily. <em>Id. </em>at 204-05. However, the Court of Appeals found that the error was harmless as to two of the defendants (Anthony DeLeon and Robledo) because of other admissible evidence of their gang affiliation, and upheld their gang aggravators. <em>Id. </em>at 205. Because of the scant evidence of Ricardo DeLeon’s gang involvement, the Court of Appeals reversed his gang aggravator and remanded for a new trial on the aggravator and resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 206, 219.</p>

The State contends that admitting the booking forms was harmless error because of other, untainted evidence of gang involvement that was also presented at trial. The other evidence included the clothes the defendants were wearing (some of which included the color red, which is associated with Norteño gangs), certain tattoos that included gang symbols, a photo on Anthony DeLeon’s cell phone that derogatorily referenced the Sureño gang, and certain songs and music groups that were on Anthony DeLeon’s phone. 10 CDP (Oct. 14, 2010) at 1667-71, 1676-81. The State also presented evidence from a witness who indicated that she had known two of the defendants to be gang members when they were in high school (although notably, Anthony DeLeon was 29 and Octavio Robledo was 23 at the time of the shooting). 8 CDP (Oct. 11, 2010) at 1421, 1423. The strongest untainted evidence was testimony by Officer Ortiz, who interviewed the three defendants after their arrest. He indicated that Ricardo DeLeon denied any gang affiliation, and that Anthony DeLeon mentioned two gangs, although the exact nature of the question and answer was not clear. 12 CDP (Oct. 18, 2010) at 1904-05.</p>

The strongest evidence that a person is a gang member is his or her own clear admission. <em>See, e.g., Fulminante, </em><a href="/us/499/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="499 U.S. 279" data-case-ids="11318776" data-case-paths="/us/499/0279-01">499 U.S. at 296</a> (“A confession is like no other evidence.

The heavy weight of that evidence does not compare to the untainted evidence presented by the State, which was largely indirect and outdated. Therefore, we cannot say <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that <em>any reasonable jury </em>would have reached the same result if given only the untainted evidence. In light of the harmful unconstitutional evidence presented at trial, we must reverse these convictions and gang aggravators. Defendants are entitled to a new trial untainted by such evidence.</p>
    <p id="b543-4" data-blocks='[["BL_543.4",543,[200,910,1254,1077]]]'>¶24 Lastly, we are concerned by some of the questionable musical evidence presented by the State as evidence of gang involvement. This evidence was cited by the Court of Appeals as “untainted” evidence of gang membership. <em>DeLeon, </em><a href="/wash-app/185/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="185 Wash. App. 171" data-case-ids="4359258" data-case-paths="/wash-app/185/0171-01">185 Wn. App. at 205</a>. For example, the Court of Appeals noted that a song by Los Tigres Del Norte was stored on Anthony DeLeon’s cell phone, and indicated that this was evidence of gang involvement. <em><a href="/wash-app/185/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="185 Wash. App. 171" data-case-ids="4359258" data-case-paths="/wash-app/185/0171-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/wash-app/185/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="185 Wash.

Los Tigres Del Norte has been one of the more prominent bands in Latin music for decades. Since forming in 1968, Los Tigres Del Norte have sold 32 million albums. They have won five Latin Grammy awards, and they have performed in front of United States troops serving abroad. There is no support in the record for the contention that enjoying their music is evidence of gang involvement. While this may not be the primary issue in this case, we felt that it was nonetheless important to take this opportunity to remind courts to exercise far more caution when drawing conclusions from a defendant’s musical preferences.</p>

Additionally, defendants challenge some of the testimony given by a gang expert regarding the general nature of gangs.

We agree that large portions of Officer Ortiz’s testimony should not have been admitted because the information at issue related to certain aspects of gang operations (such as gangs “jumping in” new members, leaders “ordering hits” from prison, and members threatening others via the Internet) that had absolutely no relevance to this case. We note that the improperly admitted evidence did not consist of simply one or two offhand comments. Officer Ortiz gave extensive testimony on how gangs generally operate, which frequently crossed the line into inflammatory statements regarding gang members. For instance, he testified that “[t]hey do some really, really bad crimes out there, whether they get caught or not.” 12 CDP (Oct. 18, 2010) at 1930. We do not see any probative value in such a statement, but there is certainly prejudice.

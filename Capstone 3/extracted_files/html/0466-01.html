CP at 106, 123. The hospital staff also had concerns that the parents were misusing prescription opiates. <em>Id. </em>at 58. The parents’ substance abuse problems created a neglectful home environment. <em>Id. </em>at 106. K.M.M. testified that she had to “take care of [her] sister and pretty much change her diaper.” 2 VRP at 283. Although ultimately no allegations of abuse were confirmed, D.C. and J.M. agreed to dependency for their daughters on the grounds that neither of them was able to care for the children due to their substance abuse problems.

The foster parents arranged for individual therapy, and K.M.M. began seeing Cory Staton in September 2009. K.M.M. presented “significant social, emotional and developmental delays” when she entered dependency. CP at 107. K.M.M. had not learned to form secure attachments to adults, meaning that she did not know how to rely on adult caregivers. 1 VRP at 64. These <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>attachment problems were exacerbated by the inappropriate corporal punishment that K.M.M. experienced in her first foster home.

Based on this definition, a service cannot be futile when the Department has never even offered it. Similarly, in <em>B.P. </em>we noted that the futility rule “derives from cases in which the State made repeated offers of services but eventually gave up after the parent refused to accept any of those offers.” <em>In re Parental Rights to B.P., </em><a href="/wash-2d/186/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="186 Wash. 2d 292" data-case-ids="12462731" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/186/0292-01">186 Wn.2d 292</a>, 316 n.5, <a href="/citations/?q=376%20P.3d%20350" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="376 P.3d 350">376 P.3d 350</a> (2016). In that case, we reversed a termination order under RCW 13.34.180(1)(d) for failing to provide necessary attachment and bonding services.

However, the examples cited by the majority point more to J.M.’s lack of <em>understanding </em>of K.M.M.’s unique needs and how he should respond to them. This is exactly why additional services are necessary, not a reason to claim that they would be futile. <em>See </em>1 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Oct. 29, 2013) at 112 (explaining that family therapy can help a parent to meet the child’s emotional needs). From the record, it appears that understanding K.M.M.’s specialized needs was a prerequisite for any adult hoping to establish a parental bond with her. <em>See </em>1 VRP at 67. As we stated in <em>C.S., </em>“When a ‘condition’ precludes reunion of parent and child, as here, regardless of whether it can be labeled a ‘parental deficiency,’ the State must provide any necessary services to address that condition as set forth in RCW 13.34.180(1)(d).” 168 Wn.2d at 56 n.3; <em>accord B.P., </em>186 Wn.2d at 316 n.6.</p>

I agree with the majority that the Department is not necessarily obligated to provide bio<a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>logical parents with services that are “identical” to those provided to foster parents. Majority at 488. However, in <em>C.S., </em>a case that is in many ways analogous to the one at issue, we reasoned that when the Department recognizes that certain available services are necessary and capable of remedying the very deficiency that is preventing reunification and the Department fails to offer those services to the biological parent when the same services have been offered to the foster parent, termination is improper. 168 Wn.2d at 55-56.</p>

The foster mother faced various difficulties in controlling C.S. until the Department placed C.S. on medication and provided the foster mother with training on how to effectively manage C.S. <em>Id. </em>at 55-56. The combination of medication and proper training proved successful. <em>Id. </em>at 56. Although C.S.’s biological mother had remedied the underlying parental deficiencies that justified the dependency, the Department did not offer her the same services because it believed the services would be futile. <em>Id. </em>at 56 n.2. The trial court acknowledged that the biological mother had remedied her parental deficiencies but nevertheless terminated the biological mother’s parental rights, finding that she “lacked ‘the patience, presence of mind, skills, experience, time in a day, and availability to care for [C.S.] - given his special needs,’ and these conditions showed there was little likelihood C.S. could be returned to [his biological mother] in the near future.” <em>Id. </em>at 55 (first alteration in original). We reversed, holding that because medication and training were necessary to address C.S.’s behavioral problems regardless of who was caring for him, and because the training was not offered to his biological mother, RCW 13.34.180(1)(d) had not been met and termination was im<a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>proper. <em>Id. </em>at 56. The fact that the Department provided training for his foster parent and medication for C.S. in order to control C.S.’s behavior indicated that proper services were not only available, but that they were necessary in order to permit <em>any </em>adult to care for C.S. and his special needs.</p>
    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[201,689,1247,1244]]]'>¶81 Like the mother in <em>C.S., </em>J.M. completed every offered service and remedied each parental deficiency underlying the initial dependency and termination. CP at 109. Importantly, according to K.M.M.’s therapist’s testimony, the attachment and bonding services that K.M.M. received and her foster parents were able to participate in were essential for K.M.M. to form healthy attachments to adults and for her foster parents to be able to understand and address K.M.M.’s behavior. 1 VRP at 67-68, 106; <em>see also </em>CP at 107. In other words, attachment and bonding services were required in order to address K.M.M.’s unique issues, and therefore should have been deemed “necessary” under RCW 13.34.180(1)(d). As in <em>C.S., </em>the fact that certain services (here, attachment and bonding services) were available to K.M.M.’s foster parents and proved successful in addressing K.M.M.’s behavioral and attachment issues indicates that such services were not only available to J.M., but that the services may have been successful had they been timely provided to J.M. Unlike the majority, I do not blame J.M.’s misunderstanding of his daughter’s needs on his lack of empathy, but rather on the Department’s failure to provide training and services for J.M. to understand and address her unique needs.</p>

However, this conclusion is directly contradicted by the trial court’s findings. Although the trial court acknowledged J.M. may have had some mental health issues, the court <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>found that his mental health needs and treatment were wholly distinct from his parenting capabilities. CP at 107, 121-24, 132. In addition, the trial court repeatedly emphasized that J.M. completed <em>all </em>services offered that were relevant to his parental deficiencies. CP at 109, 120. Substantial evidence in the record supports these findings. Given the unrelatedness of J.M.’s mental health and his successful track record in all relevant services, I would not find the provision of additional services futile. <em>See C.S., </em>168 Wn.2d at 56 (disavowing the Department’s argument that additional services would be futile when biological mother had complied with all offered services, remedied underlying parental deficiencies, and was not offered services that could have permitted reunification).</p>

    <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[201,1239,1247,532]]]'>¶83 I cannot agree that the Department fulfilled its burden of providing necessary services under RCW 13.34.180(1)(d) by showing that additional services would be futile due to J.M.’s empathy or mental health issues. Despite all efforts on J.M.’s part, the court has terminated parental rights because the severed parent-child relationship between K.M.M and J.M. is now beyond repair. I am very concerned that K.M.M.’s detachment from her father was exacerbated by the Department’s failure to provide necessary services in a timely manner.</p>
    <p id="b542-6" data-blocks='[["BL_542.6",542,[198,1795,1256,584]],["BL_543.1",543,[202,345,1246,1170]]]'>¶84 However, I recognize that under the express terms of RCW 13.34.180(1)(d), necessary services must be “capable of correcting parental deficiencies <em>within the foreseeable </em>future.” (Emphasis added.) At the termination proceeding, testimony from the mental health experts and other witnesses consistently agreed that the lack of attachment between J.M. and K.M.M. was so severe that there were no longer any services available that could promote reunification. <em>See </em>CP at 108 (noting the “severed” parent-child attachment bond and stating, “Everyone has agreed and testified that there is no reasonable probability that reuni<a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>fication therapy, or any other kind of therapy, can remedy this situation within the foreseeable future”). Based on the language of RCW 13.34.180(1)(d), which requires “necessary services” to be capable of remedying deficiencies “within the foreseeable future,” coupled with the consistent agreement that no services could repair the attachment bond once it was severed, I must reluctantly affirm the termination order. Despite the Department’s failure to provide essential services at a time when they could have helped promote reunification, I cannot ignore the legislature’s choice to include the term “within the foreseeable future” with its definition of “necessary services” and the reality that there are no longer any services that could correct the severed parent-child bond. Therefore, I must ultimately concur in the majority’s decision to affirm the termination order, but not without emphasizing J.M.’s commendable efforts in attempting reunification and expressing my frustration and disappointment with the Department’s failure to provide essential reunification and attachment services at a time when they may have preserved and strengthened the now failed bond between K.M.M. and J.M.</p>

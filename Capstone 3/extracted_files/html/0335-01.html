It provides a comparatively inexpensive mechanism for lenders to foreclose on real property pledged to <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>secure a debt through nonjudicial foreclosure,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> making certain types of loans easier for borrowers to obtain because lenders have faster recourse if the loan is not repaid. In exchange, generally, the act limits the recovery of those benefiting from a nonjudicial foreclosure to whatever is recouped from that foreclosure. It does not, generally, also allow the lender to pursue a deficiency judgment against the borrower; once the lender chooses nonjudicial foreclosure, it must be satisfied with what it gets. Today, in the consolidated cases before us, we must decide whether guarantors of commercial loans whose own property has not been foreclosed are protected from deficiency judgments under the DTA after the borrower’s property has been foreclosed. We find they are not.</p>

The DTA, however, contains certain exceptions to that general rule in connection with commercial loans such as the loans at issue in these consolidated cases. Relevant to the cases at hand, RCW 61.24.100(3)(c) allows for a deficiency judgment against a guarantor of a commercial loan “[s]ubject to this section ... if the guarantor is timely given . . . notices.” “Subject to this section” in subsection (3)(c) refers to the entirety of RCW 61.24.100 because “section” is not equivalent to “subsection,” and “[w]here the language of a statute is clear, legislative intent is derived from the language of the statute alone.” <em>City of Spokane v.

Within RCW 61.24-.100, subsection (6) states that “[a] guarantor granting a deed of trust to secure its guaranty of a commercial loan shall be subject to a deficiency judgment following a trustee’s sale under that deed of trust only to the extent stated in subsection (3)(a)(i) of this section.” Reading these provisions together, the DTA extends protection from deficiency judgments — with some exceptions — to a guarantor who grants a deed of trust to secure its guaranty of a commercial loan when the property burdened by the guarantor’s deed of <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>trust is nonjudicially foreclosed. The DTA provides a tradeoff in relation to nonjudicial foreclosure of secured property; a guarantor of a commercial loan must secure its guaranty by granting a deed of trust in order to be protected from deficiency judgments when the property burdened by its deed of trust is nonjudicially foreclosed. Here the guarantors did not secure their guaranties by granting deeds of trust, and, even if they had, the foreclosed properties were not the properties of the guarantors. Therefore, the guarantors are not protected from deficiency judgments under the DTA. Accordingly, Washington Federal may seek deficiency judgments against the guarantors.</p>

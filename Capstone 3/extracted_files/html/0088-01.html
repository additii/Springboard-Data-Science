Various purchasers made default in their payments, and the dealer was required — that event happening — to repossess the cars and pay the unpaid purchase money to GMAC as the holder of the sales contracts evidencing* ownership. This <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>contract or plan was modified to permit the dealer to pay, not upon repossessing the car, but upon the resale thereof, a receipt for the repossessed car being signed by the dealer and delivered to GMAC.</p>

    <p id="b108-8" data-blocks='[["BL_108.9",108,[289,1908,1196,503]]]'>In March, 1930, the dealer had accumulated many repossessed cars on which balances of purchase money were due, and D. S. Donovan, a representative of the GMAC, was sent to Osceola to dispose of this accumulation. Donovan remained in Osceola about six weeks, during which time twenty-five of the repossessed cars were disposed of, and the controlling question in the case is the one of fact whether these cars were sold for the account and credit of the dealer, or were taken charge of by the GMAC’s representative and sold for its accounts.</p>
    <p id="b109-2" data-blocks='[["BL_109.3",109,[176,337,1196,499]]]'>
      <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>The balance of purchase money due on the twenty-five repossessed cars and sold by Donovan is the subject of this litigation. There was a separate contract for each ear executed at the time of its sale by the dealer and transferred to the GMAC. These contracts were filed with and as parts of the demand of the GMAC against the estate of Mrs. Driver as guarantor under the instrument above copied. The probate court disallowed the claim, and so also did the circuit court on the appeal from this probate order.</p>
    <p id="b109-3" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[172,852,1201,253]]]'>The circuit court, on the hearing of the appeal from the probate court, made no special finding of fact, and it does not appear that request was made for special findings of fact. There was a general finding for defendant, and judgment accordingly, from which is this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b109-4" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[175,1119,1197,354]]]'>It appears to be conceded that, under the contract under which the GMAC bought purchase money notes and contracts from the Dealer, the latter was required to repay any unpaid purchase money which could not be collected on any such contract. Usually the repossessed cars were sold and the proceeds of such sale paid to the GMAC, and the deficiency was paid by the Dealer.</p>
    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.6",109,[171,1488,1202,710]]]'>The testimony is sharply conflicting as to how the twenty-five cars in question were disposed of, that is, whether Donovan disposed of the cars for the Dealer or for the GMAC; and the testimony is legally sufficient to support a finding either way. There is a presumption that this issue of fact was found in the defendant’s favor, and, as the testimony is sufficient to sustain that finding, this appeal is concluded thereby. It was said, in the case of <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>Layton, </em><a href="/ark/148/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="148 Ark. 156" data-case-ids="8718457" data-case-paths="/ark/148/0156-01">148 Ark. 156</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=229%20S.W.%2022" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="229 S.W. 22">229 S. W. 22</a>, (to quote a headnote in that case), that: “A general finding of the trial court, sitting as a jury, in favor of the defendant, will be sustained if there is any substantial evidence to sustain any of the grounds of defense set up in the answer. ’ ’</p>
    <p id="b109-6" data-blocks='[["BL_109.7",109,[171,2212,1198,192]]]'>It is therefore unnecessary to consider or decide the interesting questions of law which opposing counsel have discussed, as the court’s finding upon this question of fact is' decisive of the case.</p>
    <p id="b110-2" data-blocks='[["BL_110.3",110,[297,354,1195,662]]]'>
      <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>It is not questioned by either party that under the law the vendor in a conditional sales contract has the option to retake the property sold upon failure of the purchaser to pay the purchase price, in which event the debt is canceled. The vendor may, if he prefers, treat the sale as absolute and sue for the unpaid purchase money. It is not questioned that the twenty-five oars involved in this litigation were taken over from the defaulting purchasers, and this action cancels those debts; These cars were all sold for less than the amount of purchase money then due, and the purpose of this suit is to collect the difference between thé balance due on each car when it was repossessed and the price for which it was sold.</p>
    <p id="b110-3" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[295,1022,1196,404]]]'>But if the GMAC took possession of these cars as owner, and sold them to whom they pleased and for such price as they saw proper to ask, as the defendant contends and as the court, no doubt, found, such action operated to cancel the debt as to each car so disposed of. <em>Baer </em>v. <em>General Motors Acceptance </em>Corporation, <a href="/fla/101/0913-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="101 Fla. 913" data-case-ids="1293985" data-case-paths="/fla/101/0913-01">101 Fla. 913</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=132%20So.%20817" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="132 So. 817">132 So. 817</a>; <em>Singer </em>v. <em>Millard, </em><a href="/wis/171/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="171 Wis. 637" data-case-ids="8697805" data-case-paths="/wis/171/0637-01">171 Wis. 637</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=177%20N.W.%20893" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="177 N.W. 893">177 N.

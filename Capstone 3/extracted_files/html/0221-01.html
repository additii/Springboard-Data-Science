Harding, is the father, administrator and next of kin of Willard Harding, deceased. On November 25, 1931, Willard Harding, deceased, a boy about 17 years of age, was riding upon one of appellant’s freight trains, which he had boarded at Hoxie in this State. On the train with the deceased was one Oliver Jobe. The freight train was going from Hoxie to North Little Rock and passed through Austin, a station on appellant’s line of railroad, about 9. p. m. When the train begun pulling out of Austin, a brakeman approached deceased and Oliver Jobe and demanded that they get off the train. At this time the train was running about 15 miles per hour. Oliver Jobe, instead of obeying the demand of the brakeman, proceeded down the moving train of cars toward the engine, but the deceased, when last <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>seen by Jobe, remained at the place where he was when first approached by the brakeman. Oliver Jobe testified that Willard Harding stated to the brakeman that he did not want to get off the train because it was running too fast. Just before 11 p. m. of the same night, appellant operated a passenger train over and upon its tracks upon Avhich deceased was found a few minutes later. Deceased Avas found immediately after 11 p. mv having attracted the attention of people who resided in the vicinity by his cries, lying upon the south track of appellant’s railroad; both his legs and one arm were severed. In response to questions asked by attendants, deceased stated that he was knocked off the train. This declaration of deceased Avas elicited by attorneys for appellant on cross-examination of witnesses. One witness testified, upon examination, he found imprints, made by one’s feet, knees or his head, at or near the ends of the cross ties and near the point where deceased was found.</p>

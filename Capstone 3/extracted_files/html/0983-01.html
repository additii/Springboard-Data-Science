It is a matter of common knowledge that the present is a period of great depression, and that land values have decreased until there is practically no market for such property. A home that was worth $2,500' when mortgaged to secure a debt some years ago would not bring at foreclosure sale more than one-fourth of this amount, and in many cases much less. There is not only no <a id="p985" href="#p985" data-label="985" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*985</a>market for land, but practically all tbe banks in tbe country have failed, and it is impossible to borrow-money secured by mortgage or pledge of property, to pay debts, and thousands of people in Arkansas who were making a living prior to the depression have lost their jobs, are without work, and without means of support. Governments are created for the purpose of securing the rights of the citizens, and, if a government, during a period of such depression as we now have, could not protect its citizens, there would be no reason for its existence.</p>

That it existed, promised not to be presently self-curative, and called for action, appeared from, public documents and from common knowledge and observation. If the law-making power on such evidence has determined the existence of the emergency and has, in the main, dealt with it in a manner permitted by the constitutional limitations upon legislative power, so far as the same affect the class of landlords now challenging the statutes, the legislation should be upheld. * * * The proposition is equally fundamental that the State may establish regulations reasonably necessary to secure the general welfare of the community by the exercise of its police power, although the rights of private property are thereby curtailed and freedom of contract is abridged. * * * Emergency laws in time of peace are uncommon but not unknown. Wholesale disaster, financial panic, the aftermath of war, earthquake, pestilence, famine, and fire, a combination of men or the force of circumstances may, as the alternative of confusion or chaos, demand the enactment of laws that would be thought arbitrary under normal conditions.”</p>

Every contract is made in subordination to them, and must yield to their control, as conditions inherent and paramount, wherever a necessity for their execution shall occur.” * * * “It is the settled law of this court that the interdiction of statutes impairing the obligation of contracts does not prevent the State from exercising such powers as are vested in it for the pro<a id="p987" href="#p987" data-label="987" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*987</a>motion of the. common weal, or are necessary. for the general good of the public, though contracts previously entered into between individuals may thereby be affected. * * * The reservation of State power appropriate to such extraordinary conditions may be deemed to be as much a part of all contracts,, as is the reservation of State power to protect the public interest in the other situations to which we have referred. * * * The reserved power cannot be construed so as to destroy the limitations, nor is the limitation to be construed to destroy the reserved power in its essential aspects.

The court in that case said: “If the laws of the- State passed after-wards had done nothing more than change the remedy upon contracts of this description, they would be liable to no constitutional objection. For, undoubtedly, a State may regulate at pleasure the modes of proceeding in the courts in relation to past contracts as well as future. It may, for example, shorten the period of time within which claims shall be barred by the statute of limitations.” * * * “Regulations of this description have always been considered, in every civilized community, as properly belonging to the remedy, to be exercised or not by every sovereignty, according to its own views of policy and humanity. It must reside in every State to enable it to secure its citizens from unjust and harassing <a id="p988" href="#p988" data-label="988" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*988</a>litigation, and to protect them in those pursuits which are necessary to the existence and well-being of every community.

If the Legislature should change the law in any district in the State, so that the term of court would begin 60 days later than at the time the law was passed, no one would contend that this impaired the obligations of a contract, although it would postpone the time to answer 60 days. And the Legislature may, without violating any constitutional provision, ehange the time to file answer, as provided in § 1 above referred to. There is nothing in this section violating any provision of the Constitution.</p>

In my opinion § 2 of act 21 is unconstitutional as imposing a condition not previously existing, which, in many cases arising out of mortgages and deeds of trust executed before the passage of the act, will postpone and greatly delay foreclosure proceedings. "While it was no doubt contemplated that foreclosure suits must be prepared for submission before the term of court convened, it must also have been contemplated that a hearing would be had before foreclosure decrees are rendered. It is easily conceivable that, even though the first three days of the term were wholly devoted to hearing such cases — and the act does not require that this be done — all such cases, although ready for submission, might not be reached within the time limited. Not much ingenuity would be required to protract the hearing of a few cases to an extent that many other similar cases could not be heard at all, with the consequent result of a delay which might prove to be indefinite.</p>

It is well settled that the unconstitutional portion of a statute may be stricken out without impairing the effect of the remainder where the provisions are wholly indepéndent and it can be seen that the lawmakers would have enacted the remaining part of the statute, even though the act does not contain an express declaration of the intention to enact so much of the legislation as may prove to be constitutional. <em>Heinemann </em>v. <em>Sweatt, </em><a href="/citations/?q=130%20Ark.%2074" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="130 Ark. 74">130 Ark. 74</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20S.W.%20931" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="196 S.W. 931">196 S.

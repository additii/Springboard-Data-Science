It is not stated in the agreed statement of facts that he owned any other real estate, and' the reference to the real estate in the valid codicil is sufficiently definite to determine its location. The former will, which was not properly attested, is sufficiently referred to as to identify it as a part of his whole will. It is not shown that he made any other will <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>at any time, and it is not questioned that he signed this former document, believing it to be his will. The whole thought of 'Carl Bogers seemed to be to take care of his totally helpless, crippled brother.</p>
    <p id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[295,579,1195,341]]]'>We are of the opinion therefore that the two instruments constituted the will of Carl Bogers, and that the circuit court erred in setting aside' the judgment of the probate court admitting same to probate. The judgment is therefore reversed, land remanded with directions to enter a judgment sustaining the probate of said will. It is so ordered.</p>

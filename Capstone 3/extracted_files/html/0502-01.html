The court applied the rule, <em>Moioilia sequunter personam, </em>and treated the bonds and certificates of indebtedness as localized at the creditor’s domicile for taxation purposes. Consequently, it was held that their situs for taxation being in another. State, they were taxable there, and not in the State of Minnesota where they were issued. The court proceeded upon the theory that the" bonds and certificates of indebtedness were only evidence of the debts; and, when carried by the owner to another State, their situs as debts took the domicile of the owner, and that their testamentary transfer might be taxed only in the State where they were found. The reason was that their legal situs as debts was at the creditor’s domicile, and they were taxable as property there. The logical result was that the taxation upon the right of succession to the property must be laid in the State where the owner of the property resided at the time of his death and where the property had its legal situs.</p>

It was held that the State of Missouri could not levy a tax upon the succession to this property because its legal situs followed that of its owner and was in the State of Illinois. The court said that bank deposits were mere credits,''and for purposes of <em>ad valorem </em>taxation have their situs at the domicile of the creditor only. The certificate of deposit was merely the evidence -of title of the owner of the deposit, and he might carry that with him wherever he went. So, too, the notes and United States coupon bonds, under the rule that the situs of personal property follows the <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>owner, acquired a legal situs in the place where he resided. Under that rule, they were taxable as property at the owner’s domicile, which became their legal situs, and the succession tax should have been laid in the State where the owner of these evidences of debt resided. If the evidences of debt had been destroyed, the right of the owner to demand payment of the debts would have remained. The court, in effect, held that the decedent was a creditor to whom the obligors in the various bonds were indebted and to whom the banks in which he had deposited money were indebted. The extent and terms of the obligations were evidenced by the bonds and by the certificates of deposit. The local situs was at the creditor’s domicile; and, being choses in action with situs at the domicile of the creditor, they were taxable -as property there. Then, too, as said by the court in the case last cited, at that place they pass from the dead to the living, there this transfer was actually taxed. Because they were not within the State of Missouri for taxation purposes, that State had no power to levy a transfer tax.</p>

The court said that, although the corporate property was situated in the State of South Carolina, that State had no jurisdiction to impose a transfer tax upon the debt owed by the corporation to a nonresident. In this connection, it may be stated that the payment of a. succession tax to the State of South Carolina with respect to the shares of stock owned by the nonresident testator in the domestic corporation in the State of South Carolina was not contested by the executors. This shows that they recognized that the.corporation was a creature of the State of South Carolina, <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>and that the shares of stock were property there under the laws of that State.

In short, the question presents itself, is the situs of the property owned by a shareholder in a State where the corporation exists or at the domicile of the shareholder. Corporate shares of stock are property within the broad meaning of that term. Certificates of stock in the hands of their holder represent the number of shares which the corporation certifies that he is entitled to and are mere evidence of his title. In the case of bonds and certificates of deposit in a bank, the certificates represent but a property in the debt and that follows the creditor’s person. Not so in the case of certificates of shares of stock in a corporation. The corporation is the creature of State laws, and those who become its members and shareholders are subject to the operation of these laws.</p>

The reason that the State has such power is by virtue of the authority of the statute creating the corporation to determine- the basis of organization and the liability of shareholders. If it be said that the situs of the shares of stock of a corporation should follow the owner, then grave inequalities might arise in the matter. Business corporations might be organized in this State almost wholly upon foreign capital with a few shares held in the name of resident directors, and yet none of these shares of stock held by nonresidents, however valuable, would be subject to a property tax. As we have already seen, if they followed the situs of their owner, they may be taxed as property where the owner resided and not in the State where the corporation was created and upon whose laws they relied for the conduct of their business. This would necessarily result in unfair discrimination against resident stockholders.

A dissenting opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Stone, which was concurred in by Mr. Justice Holmes, and Mr. Justice Brandéis.</p>

Nellie Hicks Hunter died testate on the 19th day of January, 1927, a resident of Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee. The court found that there was an inheritance tax due the State of Arkansas in the sum of $7,796.88, and judgment was rendered in favor of appellant against appellees for that amount. The judgment further recites that it being made to appear to the court that said tax has been paid in full, as evidenced by the State Treasurer ’s receipt with certificate attached, the judgment has been satisfied in full, and that the above-described property is free from all claims of the State of Arkansas on account of said inheritance tax.</p>

The section provides for the filing of the complaint by the officers of the State whose duty it was to collect the taxes, and that a summons be issued and served on the defendants. The section also provides that the case shall be tried before the probate judge without a jury upon oral testimony or depositions. The section further provides that appeal may be taken from the judgment of the probate court to the circuit court by either party.</p>

On July 9, 1930, appellee filed the present suit in the probate court against appellant. This suit was decided in favor of appellee by the probate court, and was appealed to the, circuit court. There the case was tried upon the agreed statement of facts, as will appear from our former opinion and from the statement made above. There was again a judgment in favor of appellee, and appellant filed a motion for a new.trial on the ground that the judgment of the circuit court was contrary to law. The ease in apt time was brought to this court, and the motion for a new trial filed by appellant in the circuit court raised the question of whether the payment was a voluntary or involuntary one. For the reasons given above, we are of the opinion that the payment was voluntary, made under a mistake of law, but with a full knowledge of all the facts, and can not be recovered.</p>

It further provides for making the Commissioner of Revenues a party defendant and allows appeal by either party to the circuit court.</p>

As we have <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>just seen, the State and the taxpayer were both parties in the probate court and judgment was rendered for the payment of the tax without objection. The judgment recites that it was satisfied in full by the payifient of the tax awarded and by the taking of the State Treasurer’s receipt therefor. Hence, as we have already seen, the tax was not wrongfully and illegally collected.</p>
    <p id="b534-3" data-blocks='[["BL_534.4",534,[302,705,1198,1536]]]'>The tax might have been paid by appellee without suit and under protest, or it mig’ht have been recovered by suit. The record shows that it was recovered in the latter way. Resort to judicial proceedings on the part of the State against appellee was necessary to collect and enforce the tax. The statute provides for this mode of collection. If appellee had declined to pay it, it necessarily followed that, under the statutory mode of proceeding, it would have had its day in court where it could raise the question of its liability for the tax. If it had paid the tax under protest and for the purpose of preventing a cloud upon the title to its property, it would be entitled to&gt; recover under the section just referred to, providing* for the recovery of inheritance taxes wrongfully and illegally collected. The mere fact that the act under which the money was paid was unconstitutional in part and the tax for that reason illegally laid is not sufficient to authorize an action to recover back the amount paid under § 12 of act 106, passed by the Legislature of 1929: That act was passed to enable the taxpayer to recover taxes illegally or wrongfully paid without suit, and where they were paid under protest or some act which would be deemed in law an involuntary payment. It was never intended to apply to cases where the taxpayer had paid the tax when he had had his day in court and failed to avail himself of it and thereby give him the right to litigate over again the matter which had become <em>res judicata </em>by his failing to appeal and by his voluntary payment of the tax to satisfy the judgment. The motion for rehearing will therefore be overruled.</p>

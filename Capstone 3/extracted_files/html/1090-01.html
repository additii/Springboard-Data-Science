    <p id="A3s4" data-blocks='[["BL_1109.11",1109,[488,2234,874,45]],["BL_1109.12",1109,[165,2285,1196,140]],["BL_1110.1",1110,[299,349,1199,102]]]'>(after stating the facts). It is contended by appellant that the court erred in refusing to direct a verdict in its favor at the conclusion of the testimony, as well as in the eivinsr and refusal of certain instructions <a id="p1092" href="#p1092" data-label="1092" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1092</a>and in the admission of certain testimony objected to by it.</p>
    <p id="b1110-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1110.4",1110,[297,455,1202,960]]]'>It appears from the testimony that appellee only’in fact owned 28 of the 330 bales sold, the rest of the cotton belonging to other individuals with whom the deal was made; and the great preponderance of the testimony shows that the sale was made, that it was made on call, and that the appellant’s agent ag’reed that the purchaser would hold the cotton subject to the seller’s call, and, if the price advanced over the 17 cents per pound paid when the cotton was delivered, the seller had the right to call the contract and realize the difference, between the price paid and the price to which the cotton had advanced when it was called; while, if• the price went down, the seller could not lose more than the $5, or one cent per pound retained upon the sale, no agreement having been made to pay any greater difference should the market price go below said price advanced. The court therefore did not err in refusing to instruct a verdict for the appellant, the testimony being ample to show the contract and to support the verdict as found by the jury.</p>
    <p id="b1110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1110.5",1110,[298,1422,1198,812]]]'>Neither was error committed in allowing the introduction of the statement by appellee of what certain witnesses, who were the other parties to the sale, told him about the deal having been closed and the cotton delivered in accordance with the agreement made before he left for the Rio Grande Valley. He knew what the negotiations were before leaving, and had authorized the others to close the deal in his absence, which was done, and the testimony was but a report to him of the closing of the contract from which he could testify that the contract had been imade and dosed and the cotton delivered and paid for in accordance with its terms. The draft paid for the cotton was made payable to him and put in the bank until his return, when the money was distributed by him in accordance with the amount of cotton owned by the different persons interested in the sale.</p>

It was within the discretion of the court to allow an amendment stating a different cause of action after the trial was begun, and there was no abuse of discretion shown in refusing the instructions on such an issue which had not been raised, and such action amounted to a refusal to allow the amendment. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Branch, </em><a href="/ark/171/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="171 Ark. 611" data-case-ids="1369417" data-case-paths="/ark/171/0611-01">171 Ark. 611</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20S.W.%20353" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="285 S.W. 353">285 S.

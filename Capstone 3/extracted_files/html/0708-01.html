The Court of Appeals, in a two to one opinion, affirmed the defendant’s convictions for assault in the second degree with a firearm enhancement and first degree unlawful possession of a firearm.

Accordingly, Humphries argues that before a stipulation can be entered, a court must engage in a colloquy with the defendant to ensure that the defendant is entering the stipulation knowingly and voluntarily. The State argues that whether to enter a stipulation is a strategic decision to be made by counsel and that the defendant’s express objection is irrelevant. This is an issue of first impression in Washington. We hold that although the decision to stipulate an element of the crime does not generally require a colloquy on the record with the defendant, such a decision may not be made over the defendant’s known and express objection.</p>

There, the defendant’s attorney signed a stipulation to two elements of a charged crime. On appeal, the defendant argued that stipulations such as this required a trial court to personally question the defendant to determine voluntariness, as is required for the entry of guilty pleas. The court rejected this rule, recognizing a difference between pleading guilty, which requires such a colloquy, and stipulating to crucial facts. As the court reasoned, requiring trial courts to question defendants personally as to the voluntariness of every stipulation would “needlessly delay and confuse the conduct of a typical trial.” <em>Ferreboeuf, </em><a href="/f2d/632/0832-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="632 F.2d 832" data-case-ids="1416921" data-case-paths="/f2d/632/0832-01">632 F.2d at 836</a>.

Suppl. Br. of Resp’t at 10-18 (July 16, 2013). The State reasons that if an attorney can concede guilt to an entire crime during closing argument, he or she should also be able to stipulate to an element of a charged crime. None of these cases, however, involved a situation where the attorney conceded guilt during closing argument over the express objection of the defendant, and they provide no support for the idea that an attorney can. Moreover, even if this were not the case, an attorney’s concession during closing argument does not waive any of the defendant’s relevant constitutional rights. The State is still required to bear its burden, present admissible evidence, and convince a jury of every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

The test of when defense counsel’s chosen trial strategy must yield to the defendant’s objection is not, simply, that the defendant’s constitutional rights are directly implicated. Nor does the trial court’s knowledge that the defendant disagrees with his lawyer matter in answering the question of whether client or counsel holds ultimate decision-making authority on a particular issue. Because I agree with the trial court below that Humphries’s counsel had the authority to enter into the stipulation despite Humphries’s objection, I would affirm. While I agree with the majority that Humphries did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his rights in connection with the stipulation, such a waiver was not required.</p>

Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Oct. 13, 2010) at 46-47. Despite this lack of physical evidence, his attorney was concerned the jury would be distracted by Humphries’s criminal history, which included dispositions for first degree robbery, second degree robbery, and attempted second degree robbery. CP at 11. Counsel advised Humphries it would be wise to stipulate to a prior serious offense conviction, which would preclude the State from introducing evidence of his past crimes. Tr. of Proceedings (Oct. 12, 2010) at 5-6. No one — not even Humphries or the majority — questions the wisdom of counsel’s advice. Evidence of Humphries’s past crimes could only prejudice the jury against him. <em>Old Chief v.

Noting that the State presented no evidence in light of the stipulation, the majority concludes that the error was not harmless. It rejects as “irrelevant” the fact “that the State ‘was fully prepared to present evidence’ of the prior conviction.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=285%20P.3d%20917" class="citation" data-index="167" data-cite="285 P.3d 917">Id.</a> </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Humphries, </em><a href="/wash-app/170/0777-01" class="citation" data-index="168" data-cite="170 Wash.

Smith, </em><a href="/wash-2d/148/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="169" data-cite="148 Wash. 2d 122" data-case-ids="609208" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/148/0122-01">148 Wn.2d 122</a>, 139, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20P.3d%2074" class="citation" data-index="170" data-cite="59 P.3d 74">59 P.3d 74</a> (2002). But, <em>Smith </em>involved the erroneous <em>admission </em>of evidence. Here, we are concerned with an alleged error (acceptance of the stipulation) that operated to preclude the State from introducing otherwise admissible evidence. In other words, the error at issue, if there was error, involved the erroneous <em>exclusion </em>of evidence, and we must examine the question of harmless error in this context. Relying on a test that looks only to other evidence admitted at trial is both artificial and unhelpful. Once defense counsel offered to stipulate to a prior serious offense conviction, the State was obligated to accept this stipulation and was precluded from presenting evidence of Humphries’s criminal history. <em>Old Chief, </em><a href="/us/519/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="171" data-cite="519 U.S. 172" data-case-ids="11595223" data-case-paths="/us/519/0172-01">519 U.S. at 190-92</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">11</a> Because the alleged error in this case had a mandatory exclusionary effect, a meaningful harmless <a id="p733" href="#p733" data-label="733" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*733</a>error analysis requires that we look beyond what was presented to the jury and consider the effect of the erroneous decision at issue. This is consistent with the essential purpose of harmless error inquiry, which asks, “Was the defendant afforded, not a perfect but, rather a fair trial?— for the constitution guarantees no one a perfect trial.” <em>State v. Green, </em><a href="/wash-2d/71/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="172" data-cite="71 Wash. 2d 372" data-case-ids="1095269" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/71/0372-01">71 Wn.2d 372</a>, 373, <a href="/citations/?q=428%20P.2d%20540" class="citation" data-index="173" data-cite="428 P.2d 540">428 P.2d 540</a> (1967). To answer this question, we look to the record; “if the record supports a finding that the jury verdict would be the same absent the error, harmless error may be found.” <em>State v. Berube, </em><a href="/wash-2d/150/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="174" data-cite="150 Wash. 2d 498" data-case-ids="9194950" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/150/0498-01">150 Wn.2d 498</a>, 506, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20P.3d%201144" class="citation" data-index="175" data-cite="79 P.3d 1144">79 P.3d 1144</a> (2003).</p>
    <p id="b775-4" data-blocks='[["BL_775.4",775,[124,969,1254,687]]]'>¶43 The record in this case establishes that the State had certified copies of Humphries’s prior criminal history, CP at 56-88, and that the stipulation was admitted in lieu of the State’s proffer. Absent the stipulation, the State would have submitted its evidence to establish Humphries’s prior convictions for a serious offense. This evidence, beyond simply proving the element of a “prior serious offense,” carried a risk of unfair prejudice to Humphries. <em>See Old Chief, </em><a href="/us/519/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="176" data-cite="519 U.S. 172" data-case-ids="11595223" data-case-paths="/us/519/0172-01">519 U.S. at 185</a> (recognizing “risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant”). Defense counsel’s stipulation was therefore harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. If admission of the stipulation violated Humphries’s constitutional rights, I would affirm on this alternative basis.</p>

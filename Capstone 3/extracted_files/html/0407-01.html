      <em>Id. </em>at 4. Both detectives testified that the unintelligible portion of the recording was Piatnitsky stating once again that he did not want to make an audio-recorded confession. The detectives complied with that request and stopped recording. Instead, one of the detectives wrote down Piatnitsky’s version of the events, which Piatnitsky edited. At some point, Piatnitsky did not like where the questioning was going and he told detectives he was finished and cut off the <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>interview. The detectives stopped asking questions and finished the statement. Piatnitsky then reviewed everything that had been written, requested some changes, and signed the corrected statement.</p>

Before the trial, he challenged the admissibility of his written statement to the police, arguing that he did not waive his right to remain silent knowingly and voluntarily. The trial judge conducted a CrR 3.5 hearing and found that all of Piatnitsky’s statements, written and oral, were admissible because Piatnitsky was able to knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his rights despite his emotional and physical state at the time of interrogation. Piatnitsky was convicted of murder in the first degree, attempted murder in the first degree, possession of a stolen firearm, and unlawful possession of a firearm in the second degree. The trial court imposed a standard-range sentence of 600 months. Piatnitsky appealed, arguing, among other things, that the trial court should have suppressed his statements because he had successfully invoked his right to silence. <em>State v.

In response to a question about whether he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Piatnitsky said, “I have a right to remain silent. . . . That’s the, that’s the only one I remember.... That’s the one I, I should be doing right now.” Pretrial Ex. 3, at 2 (alterations in original). Piatnitsky himself admits that he <em>should have </em>been exercising his right to silence, which, when properly understood, means that he was not actually doing so. Immediately after this interaction, one of the detectives explained that he wanted to get a recording of Piatnitsky’s confession but that he first wanted to go through <em>Miranda </em>once again. To this, Piatnitsky responded, “I’m not ready to do this, man.” <em><a href="/us/469/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="469 U.S. 91" data-case-ids="11958689" data-case-paths="/us/469/0091-01">Id.</a> </em>The detective asked for a clarification because earlier Piatnitsky had indicated willingness to confess on audio recording.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Piatnitsky obliged, saying, “I just write it down, man.

We should hold that Samuel Piatnitsky unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent when he said those very words during a police interrogation. While he qualified his invocation of rights with his assent to “write it down,” he was not allowed to write anything down. Rather, the police continued their interrogation. Although the police wrote down a statement in the process and Piatnitsky signed the statement, these subsequent facts do not make equivocal his earlier statement that “I don’t want to talk right now.” The majority opinion whittles away the right to be free from self-incrimination and ignores the inherently coercive nature of custodial interrogation.</p>

In affirming, the court of appeals relied on three contextual points: first, that Piatnitsky talked with the detectives prior to the audio-recorded interview; second, that Piatnitsky “participated fully” in Detective Allen’s preparation of the written statement; and third, that Piatnitsky said he was willing to “ ‘write it down.’ ” <em>State v.

    <p id="b484-6" data-blocks='[["BL_484.7",484,[216,1740,1251,630]]]'>¶30 The third contextual clue is more relevant; it is true, as the Court of Appeals points out, that Piatnitsky qualified his refusal. Immediately prior to saying, “I don’t want to talk . . .,” Piatnitsky stated that “I just write it down . . . .” Pretrial Ex. 3, at 2. <em>Barrett </em>addressed the situation where a suspect agreed to talk while refusing to provide a written statement. This case presents the converse: the suspect agreed to <em>write </em>but refused to <em>talk. </em>Thus, as Piatnitsky’s counsel conceded at oral argument, there would be no <em>Miranda </em>issue if the police indeed had ceased their oral conversation with Piatnitsky and had abided by his request to “write it down.”</p>

In other words, the police resumed their questioning, with the only difference being that Detective Allen was writing down Piatnitsky’s answers. As the court of appeals correctly notes, the Supreme Court held in <em>Barrett </em>that where a suspect expresses a clear intention to communicate with the police through one medium and not another, the police may respect the suspect’s choice without running afoul of <em>Miranda. </em><a href="/us/479/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="479 U.S. 523" data-case-ids="6219506" data-case-paths="/us/479/0523-01">479 U.S. at 529</a>. And the court of appeals’ reliance on <em>Barrett </em>would be proper if the police had indeed respected Piatnitsky’s choice of medium. They did not; they continued to talk to him after he said he did not want to talk. Piatnitsky’s invocation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was clear and unequivocal as to <em>talking, </em>and yet the police persisted in talking to Piatnitsky. The majority ignores this fact and, instead, gives too much deference to police interrogators at the expense of protecting defendants’ rights.</p>

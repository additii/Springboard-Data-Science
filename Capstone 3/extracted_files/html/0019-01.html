If a wall of roadside vegetation makes the roadway unsafe by blocking a driver’s view of oncoming traffic at an intersection, the municipality has a duty to take reasonable steps to address it. In this case, there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether this duty was breached and whether any breach proximately caused petitioner Guy Wuthrich’s injuries.

However, to the extent legal causation includes a notice component, it is simply notice of the <em>condition. Niebarger v. City of Seattle, </em><a href="/wash-2d/53/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="53 Wash. 2d 228" data-case-ids="1011262" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/53/0228-01">53 Wn.2d 228</a>, 229-30, <a href="/citations/?q=332%20P.2d%20463" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="332 P.2d 463">332 P.2d 463</a> (1958). There is evidence in the record that the blackberry bushes had been there for years and the County knew about them. The lack of prior accidents could be relevant circumstantial evidence as to the reasonableness of the County’s actions when evaluating breach, but it does not preclude legal causation.</p>

We therefore reverse the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>

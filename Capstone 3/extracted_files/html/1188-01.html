Appellant says that the uncontradicted and admitted testimony is that, at the time the policy was issued, the land had forfeited for taxes to the State of Arkansas and had not been redeemed within the two-year period, and that the State owned this property. The testimony does -show that the land had forfeited, but it does not show whether it had been redeemed. Plaintiff’s daughter made a deed to him after the policy of insurance was written and delivered. The plaintiff was in possession, paying taxes. There is no proof that the daughter did not redeem the land. 'The presumption is that it was redeemed. The fact that the land had been ordered sold, as stated by appellant, under certain decrees of the chancery court, did not violate any of the provisions of the policy. There is no evidence that the plaintiff concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance. The suits that were brought in the chancery court were suits <em>in rem, </em>and no notice, so far as the record shows, was served on the plaintiff. Moreover, if the suits had been pending in court and plaintiff had been served, this would not be any violation of any of the terms of the policy, because the plaintiff had the right at any time to pay the assessments, and, if it had been sold, he had a right to redeem it, and there was therefore no violation in this of the sole and unconditional ownership clause, and, so far as this record shows, there was no misrepresentation or concealment.</p>

Of course this was erroneous; but it was proper to tell them, if they found these facts to be true they would find for the defendant, unless they found that the defendant waived this provision. And this is true of each instruction which is modified by adding the words, “unless you find that the defendant waived said provisions of the policy.”</p>

It is' true Reed’s testimony was to the effect that Williams started the fire and burned His own property. This testimony is contradicted by Williams, and a number of other .witnesses testified to facts which are in conflict with Reed’s testimony. Reed’s testimony was to the effect that Williams poured gasoline or something on the stove and stovepipe and set it on fire. Two or three witnesses swear that the fire started several feet from the stove. Reed also testifies that he saw the fire, and had seen Williams pouring something on the stove or pipe, and testified that it looked like there was some paper set on fire in the stove, and the place flamed up. Reed went home after seeing this, .stating that he thought Williams wanted to burn it, and it was none of witness’ business. He went home and lay down op the bed, but did not go to sleep, and he was at home when his own store caught fire. It therefore appears that the evidence is conflicting on the question of the origin of the fire, and this court does not pass on the credibility of the witnesses where there has been a trial at law, nor the weight to be given to their testimony, the rule being that if there is substantial evidence to sustain the verdict it will not be disturbed.</p>

She went downstairs, and came back with a pistol in a paper bag, and came in and sat on the front seat, and that is the reason witness .did not tell the truth about seeing Williams. This action on the part of the appellant was a violation of the statute that he now invokes. If the wife was incompetent to testify, it was just as much a violation of the statute to have some witness to testify to what she said as it wouid be to put her on the stand and let her testify herself. The statute prohibits the testifying- by husband or wife for or against each other, and the appellant should not have offered proof of any declarations or statements of Mrs. Williams. If the law permitted evidence of this character, one could do indirectly what the statute prohibits doing directly. Then it would be manifestly unfair to permit one party to prove statements of the wife and then prohibit her from denying- the alleged statements.</p>

Cross then forced his way into the bedroom M.B. shared with her 15-year-old sister, Amanda, and killed Amanda.

On direct appeal, Cross made a similar claim.

After acknowledging once more that he understood his rights, Cross stated, “I don’t want to talk about it.” Silcox walked away and then returned to offer Cross a glass of water. Taking pity on Cross, Silcox said, “Sometimes we do things we normally wouldn’t do, and we feel bad about it later.” Cross did not drink the glass of water. Cross then said, “I fucking had it. How can you feel good about doing something like this. I can’t find a job, they want a thousand dollars in fucking child support. I fucking had it.

Cross was then moved into a holding cell. Soule approached Cross in the cell and asked, “Do you want to talk about it?” Cross responded with the same statement — that he had “fucking had it” with the child support, and that his ex-wife was next on the list. About three and a half hours later, Cross met with his attorney. Because Cross was classified as a high-security inmate, Cross was escorted to one side of a room partitioned by glass. He communicated with his attorney, who sat on the other side of the glass partition, via a telephone. There was a small opening in the glass partition above the counter, called the “pass-through slot,” to exchange documents. Once Cross was inside the room, he was left alone and the door was closed with the officers stationed outside. The officers could not overhear any conversation between Cross and his attorney. At some point during the conversation, the attorney signaled to correction officers that Cross needed to sign some documents. There is a policy that inmates are not allowed to possess pens, so Officer Rosalind Deede stood by while Cross signed the documents and passed them through to his attorney. The attorney slid a copy back to Cross. At this time, Officer Marshall Coolidge entered the room, thinking they were getting ready to take Cross back to his cell because the interview was over. When the documents were passed back through the slot to Cross, <a id="p680" href="#p680" data-label="680" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*680</a>Cross yelled, “I don’t need that. I don’t give a fuck. The motherfuckers are all dead. I killed them. My life is over.” Both Officers Deede and Coolidge heard the statement. In addition, the statement was loud enough to be heard outside the closed door.</p>

On September 7, 2000, the judge made findings of facts and conclusions of law, ultimately admitting all of Cross’s custodial statements. The judge found that Cross had not invoked his right to remain silent, Silcox’s comment was not interrogation, and Cross validly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. On October 23, 2000, Cross entered his <em>Alford </em>plea of guilty. Cross’s custodial statements were used as evidence in the sentencing phase.</p>

In addition, Dr. Wheeler, the State’s expert, reviewed the circumstances surrounding the murders and opined that Cross did not appear to suffer from mania or delusions and that there was evidence of planning. Dr. Wheeler pointed out Cross’s increased substance abuse, stress from child support debt, partial unemployment, and increasing conflict with his wife regarding money-related issues.

Notably, Dr. Grindlinger averred that he “had no independent recollection” of his work with Cross outside of the written evaluations.

We reject this claim because allowing Cross’s taped statement into evidence was a legitimate trial tactic.

Cross stated, “I’m goin’ nuts. I just can’t take it.” When Doyon asked if he had planned the murders, Cross responded, “It just came out.” Thus, during the interview, Cross admitted to the murders but denied premeditation and planning. Defense counsel also used the tape to show Cross’s remorse.

Thus, we find that defense counsel timely apprised the trial court of Cross’s mental health history, causing the trial court to further investigate Cross’s intellectual abilities to the extent permitted by Cross.

The testimony regarding domestic violence was not cumulative or graphic in nature. It did not describe acts overly similar to the crime being charged.

The overall strategy was to show that Cross’s stressors were cyclical — and the cycle that began in late 1996 exploded in the unplanned murders of Cross’s wife and two of his stepdaughters. This was a legitimate trial tactic because at least one juror may have sympathized with Cross’s overall plight, exacerbated by intense financial stress, and spared him the death penalty.</p>

On direct appeal, we left open the issue of whether it was ineffective assistance of counsel to fail to request this instruction. We acknowledged that “a law abiding jury might not have felt it could question an element of the underlying crime to which Cross pleaded guilt [y] as a mitigating factor.” <em>Cross, </em>156 Wn.2d at 605 n.6. Lack of premeditation was central to <a id="p719" href="#p719" data-label="719" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*719</a>Cross’s defense. Indeed, Cross explicitly denied premeditating the murders in his <em>Alford </em>plea and consistently maintained that he did not deserve the death penalty because he did not premeditate the killings.

This was not ineffective assistance of counsel because there was no prejudice. Both parties at trial referred to the <em>Alford </em>plea as a guilty plea, and defense counsel used the fact that Cross entered a “guilty plea” to show that he was taking responsibility for his actions. It would not have helped Cross for the jury to know that technically, a defendant who enters an <em>Alford </em>plea does not acknowledge guilt but instead merely concedes there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction. This tends to refute defense counsel’s argument that Cross was taking responsibility for his actions. Moreover, there is no evidence that the jury misunderstood what an <em>Alford </em>plea was or that an explanatory instruction would have changed their decision. Thus, there was no prejudice.</p>

The State argued that the actual language of the plea — “I do not believe I acted with premeditated intent. I also do not believe that the three murders were part of any common scheme or plan or the result of a single act” — suggested that Cross did not accept responsibility for his crimes. And even if this amounted to arguing the form of the plea, there is no evidence that making the motion would have changed the outcome of the case.

This claim fails because there is no evidence that the jury considered medical costs when they decided to impose the death penalty. Indeed, the jurors were instructed that they should impose the death penalty only if they were convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there were not sufficient mitigating circumstances. The mitigating circumstances listed did not include the cost of lifelong detainment. Cross has not shown a reasonable probability that the jury would have ruled differently had they received such an instruction.

That is, once the evidence is deemed admissible under <em>Bartholomew, </em>it is proper fodder for proving an aggravating factor.

For instance, during the plea colloquy, the trial court asked if Cross understood the difference between premeditation as an element of first degree murder and planned acts. Cross responded, “That I planned. And premeditate doesn’t necessarily mean — for premeditated, you have to sit there and plan it out for a long period of time.” From this, it seems Cross did not understand what premeditation was. At other times, however, Cross seemed to understand that planning demands a greater degree of forethought. For example, Cross believed he had a good chance the jury would not sentence him to death because he had not planned — i.e., extensively plotted out — the murders. The terms “planning” and “premeditation” were used interchangeably at trial at critical moments. But as we explain, Cross could and did argue both lack of planning and premeditation, so there was no prejudice.</p>

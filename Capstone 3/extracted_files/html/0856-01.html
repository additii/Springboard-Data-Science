Christopher Piris was charged with three counts of first degree rape of a child, which occurred between September 27, 1990, and September 27, 1993. Piris pleaded guilty to two of those counts. The rape charges arose out of two separate incidents that occurred when Piris (who was between 11 and 13 years old at the time) had sexual intercourse with his stepbrother (who was then between 9 and 11 years old). Although the rapes occurred between 1990 and 1993 when Piris was a minor, he was charged in 1997 when he was 19 years old and in 1998 pleaded guilty to two counts of first degree rape of a child.</p>

Nielsen also claimed that upon receipt of the mandate, he wrote to Piris, enclosing the mandate and informing Piris that he was closing Piris’s file.

On May 7, 2012, Piris appeared before Judge Timothy Bradshaw (Judge Mertel had since retired) on an alleged violation of his supervised release terms. Realizing that Piris had never been resentenced, Judge Bradshaw imposed a sentence of 146 months for the two counts of rape of a child in the first degree. While this sentence was at the bottom of the corrected standard sentencing range, the record does not indicate the judge’s reasoning for choosing this term of confinement.

They hired two defense attorneys for trial. Before trial, the attorneys negotiated a plea bargain, which the Angs rejected, and the case proceeded to a jury trial. Five days into trial, the Angs’ attorneys recommended a second plea deal. The Angs viewed this plea agreement as the least desirable. Mr. Ang “was allegedly told that Mrs. Ang could face sexual assault in prison,” which convinced the couple to take the agreement offered during trial and plead guilty to 2 of the 18 counts. <em>Ang, </em>154 Wn.2d at 480. The Angs sought an outside opinion from another attorney, who concluded that the government failed to meet its burden of proof and that the plea agreement the Angs accepted provided them no material benefit. Through another attorney, the Angs then successfully moved to withdraw their pleas (which the judge had not formally accepted), and the matter moved to a bench trial. At the new trial, the government offered yet another plea agreement, which was rejected, and the Angs were acquitted on all 18 counts. The Angs sued their former attorneys, claiming malpractice, and the case went to trial before a jury. The jury found that the Angs failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they were innocent of all criminal charges against them. The Angs appealed.</p>

We reasoned that for legal causation to satisfy proximate cause, the actual innocence requirement was rooted in public policy: “To determine <a id="p863" href="#p863" data-label="863" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*863</a>whether the cause in fact . . . should also be deemed the legal cause of [plaintiff’s] harm, a court may consider, among other things, the public policy implications of holding the defendant liable.” <em>Ang, </em>154 Wn.2d at 482 (citing <em>Hartley v.

We identified five factors of public policy rationale that mandated the actual innocence requirement in criminal malpractice cases: (1) prohibiting criminals from benefiting from their own bad act, (2) maintaining respect for the criminal justice system, (3) removing the harmful, chilling effect on the defense bar, (4) preventing suits from criminals who may be guilty but could have gotten a better deal, and (5) preventing a flood of nuisance litigation. <em>Ang, </em>154 Wn.2d at 485. We found that actual innocence is critical to a criminal malpractice claim and that “[u]nless criminal malpractice plaintiffs can prove by a preponderance of the evidence their actual innocence of the charges, their own bad acts, not the alleged negligence of defense counsel, should be regarded as the cause in fact of their harm<em>.” Ang, </em>154 Wn.2d at 485.

Piris’s underlying conviction for first degree rape of a child was unaffected, and the later sentence reduction—even if the actual time served was more—was within the court’s authority. This brings us exactly under the reasoning and policy considerations of <em>Ang. </em>Whatever sentence was imposed or served is based on Piris’s conviction, and any sentencing modification remains within the court’s authority and discretion to impose. While Judge Mertel did indicate an intent to sentence Piris at the bottom of the range at the original sentencing, it is too speculative to conclude he would have imposed anything less if provided the correct score. Our conclusion would be no different had, at resen-<a id="p866" href="#p866" data-label="866" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*866</a>tencing, new defense counsel been successful in advocating for an exceptional downward sentence or if Judge Mertel had indicated that at the original sentence, a downward sentence might have been imposed.

While a certain portion of the blame may understandably be aimed at his defense counsel for failing to follow through on scheduling resentencing, both of Piris’s sentences were the natural result of the crime to which he pleaded guilty. The maximum term for first degree rape of a child is life in prison. Piris pleaded guilty to two counts of this crime. Despite being given two different standard ranges for his crime (with the latter resulting in a slightly shorter sentence), his criminal acts naturally produced both sentences.</p>

[B]oth of Piris’s sentences were the natural result of the crime to which he pleaded guilty.” Majority at 866. I disagree for two reasons. First, as noted, we do not need to overrule <em>Ang </em>to allow Piris to proceed with his criminal malpractice claim. We were concerned in <em>Ang </em>with plaintiffs alleging harm stemming from their attorneys’ conduct during the guilt/innocence stage of the trial. In this case, Piris is alleging harm not at the guilt/innocence phase, or even at the sentencing phase, but at the phase of proceedings when he was entitled to receive the benefit of having secured postconviction relief. We therefore need to carve out only a small exception to <em>Ang’s </em>actual innocence rule to allow Piris to proceed with his claim.</p>

The harm Piris alleges is the time he spent in prison <em>beyond </em>his lawful sentence; this harm is <a id="p874" href="#p874" data-label="874" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*874</a>not the direct result of his criminal acts, but of the alleged malpractice. <em>See Powell, </em><a href="/wash-app/131/0810-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="131 Wash.

Piris should not have to prove his actual innocence as a precondition to seeking damages for these 13 months. From a practical standpoint, he is in the same position as the plaintiff in Powell; regardless of whether his excess sentence exceeded a statutory maximum or the confinement term the court imposed, it was unlawful.

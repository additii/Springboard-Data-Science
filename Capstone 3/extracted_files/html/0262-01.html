After Samalia successfully escaped, the police searched the cell phone without a warrant and made contact with one of the numbers stored in the cell phone. That contact led to Samalia’s identification as the owner of the phone and driver of the stolen vehicle. The State used this evidence against Samalia at trial. Samalia contends that his right to be free from unreasonable searches was violated when the State introduced the identification evidence derived from the search of his cell phone. We hold that although Samalia initially had a constitutionally protected privacy interest in the cell phone and its data, he abandoned that interest when he voluntarily left the cell phone in a stolen vehicle while fleeing from a lawful traffic stop. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>

    <p id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.8",304,[201,1441,1247,424]]]'>¶2 Yakima Police Officer Ryan Yates observed what he believed to be a stolen vehicle while on patrol. He confirmed with dispatch that the vehicle was stolen and began to follow it. Eventually, the driver stopped, got out of the vehicle, and faced Officer Yates. Officer Yates gave the driver various commands, but the driver did not obey and ran away. Officer Yates attempted to chase after the driver, but the driver successfully escaped.</p>
    <p id="b304-6" data-blocks='[["BL_304.9",304,[202,1890,1246,313]]]'>¶3 Failing to apprehend the driver, Officer Yates returned to the stolen vehicle and began to search it without a warrant. Officer Yates found a cell phone somewhere near the vehicle’s center console, but he did not know to whom it belonged. He then began calling some of the contacts listed in the cell phone.</p>

He told Telles that he had found a cell phone and wanted to return it to its owner. Telles agreed to meet <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>at a designated location. When Telles arrived at that location, Yakima Police Sergeant Henne immediately arrested her. Sergeant Henne seized Telles’ cell phone and used the cell phone recovered by Officer Yates to call it. Telles’ cell phone displayed Samalia’s name and photo, identifying him as the caller. Officer Yates then looked up Samalia’s photo in a law enforcement database and identified Samalia as the driver who fled from the stolen vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.4",305,[201,800,1247,867]]]'>¶5 On these facts, the State charged Samalia with possession of a stolen vehicle. Samalia moved to suppress the cell phone evidence, arguing that the officers violated his constitutional rights when they seized and searched his cell phone with neither a warrant nor a valid exception to the warrant requirement. The State responded that the war-rantless search was valid under the abandonment doctrine. The trial court denied Samalia’s motion, agreeing with the State that no warrant was required under the abandonment doctrine. The trial court held that Samalia voluntarily abandoned any privacy interest that he had in the cell phone by leaving it in the stolen vehicle, which he also voluntarily abandoned, while fleeing from Office Yates. After denying Samalia’s suppression motion and subsequent motion for reconsideration, the trial court found Samalia guilty as charged in a bench trial.</p>
    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[200,1691,1248,422]]]'>¶6 Samalia appealed, and the Court of Appeals, Division Three, affirmed the trial court in a split decision. <em>State v.

A government search of a cell phone has the potential to reveal a vast amount of personal information. The United States Supreme Court recently described the intimate and personal details that cell phones may contain in <em>Riley v. </em>California, _ U.S. _, <a href="/s-ct/134/2473-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="134 S.

The Court then continued on the ramifications of the large data storage capacities of cell phones: a cell phone typically contains far more personal information than a person would normally carry in written form; searching a cell phone discloses prior searches for information by the cell phone owner, suggesting private facts about the owner; and cell phone applications, or apps, collect information on specific subjects. <em><a href="/s-ct/134/2473-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="134 S.

In answer to the notion that a person who voluntarily abandons a physical cell phone voluntarily abandons any privacy interest in any of the voluminous data detailing potentially every aspect of that person’s life, I quote the pointed words of amicus in this case: “It would be patently absurd to suggest that abandonment of a traditional key means that warrantless access is allowed to the house it locks; the same must be true of digital keys to electronic information.” Amicus Curiae Br. of Am.

This is well illustrated by the facts presented here. The police officer in this case testified that the reason he looked through the cell phone at issue here was “[t]o see who the phone belonged to.” Tr. of Stipulated Bench Trial (May 7, 2013) at 48. Although the officer was “hoping that the person that ran was also the person who owned the phone,” he testified that he “couldn’t recall either way” whether he thought the phone might have belonged to the rightful owner of the stolen vehicle, who certainly didn’t voluntarily abandon her vehicle or its contents. <em>Id. </em>at 48-49.

The owner of a lost or mislaid cell phone might successfully prevent any information from the phone from being used against him or her in a criminal case, but can neither prevent nor undo the invasion of privacy that has already occurred when, as happened in this case, an investigating officer looks through a person’s contact list for entries indicating an intimate or familial relation, such as “girlfriend” or “[s]weetheart.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">10</a>

As is true for all searches, I would hold that a search of digital data, even on an abandoned cell phone, must be pursuant to a lawfully issued warrant, supported by probable cause and subject to “detached scrutiny by a neutral magistrate” with “precise limits established in advance by a specific court order.” <em>Katz, </em><a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">389 U.S. at 356</a>.</p>

Because the police did not <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>obtain a warrant here, the search was unlawful and its fruits should have been suppressed.

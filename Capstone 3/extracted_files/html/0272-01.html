The tribe itself — acting through its tribal enterprise — consensually entered into a contract where it both waived its sovereign immunity and consented to jurisdiction in state court for claims related to that contract. It first waived its sovereign immunity with respect to any claim related to the contract. <em>See </em>CP at 446 (“the Borrower hereby expressly grants to the Lender and all Persons entitled to benefit from any Loan Document an irrevocable limited waiver of its sovereign immunity from suit or legal process with respect to any [claim brought under the contract]”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The contract indicated an understanding by the parties that a waiver of sovereign immunity may not be enough to confer jurisdiction on a state court, as the contract went on to provide, “In furtherance of this waiver, <em>the Borrower hereby consents with respect to any Claim ... to be sued in .. . any court of general jurisdiction in the State </em>(including all courts of the State to which decisions of such courts may be appealed).” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).

The Tribe entered into a contract in its own territory with an entity entirely foreign to Washington State. It obtained a loan, secured by tribal property, for the purpose of engaging in a commercial enterprise to be run by the Tribe on Indian land for the benefit of its own tribal members. And, as noted above, tribal business operations, and gaming operations in particular, are essential to achieving the goals of tribal self-sufficiency and self-government. <em>Michigan v.

The corollary is that the exercise of state jurisdiction is not “particularly compatible with tribal autonomy” when, as in this case, the suit is brought by a non-Indian <em>against </em>the tribe, there has been no showing that the tribal court lacks jurisdiction over the claim, and the other factors in <em>Williams </em>weigh against state-court jurisdiction.</p>

Outsource can bring its claims in the tribal court or dispute resolution system (and federal courts may also have jurisdiction). Other parties who contract with the Tribe can accept tribal jurisdiction or negotiate for waivers of tribal autonomy sufficient to fully waive sovereign immunity, fully waive all jurisdictional challenges, and fully consent to state court jurisdiction over the Tribe for all claims arising from the contract. But that did not occur here, and extending state-court jurisdiction to this case without such full and clearly expressed consent conflicts with <em>Williams </em>and infringes on the Tribe’s authority to govern its own affairs.

It appears that the plaintiff was injured while he and another section man were throwing ties out of a box-car. A work-train was unloading ties between Mulberry and Fort Smith, Arkansas, for the purpose of putting the ties in the railroad track. The ties were being unloaded as the train moved along at a speed estimated from two, three, or four miles per hour. The work-train had been unloading ties for two or three days, and had gone from the Mulberry section to the Dyer section towards Yan Burén. The train would move forward a short distance, and stop. The section men kept throwing out the ties, whether the train stopped or was in motion. One of the section crew would take hold of the front end of the tie, and another the rear end of it, and then walk to the side door of the car and, after giving the tie a swing, would throw it on the ground. On the morning of the accident Hall was the front man, and just as they went to swing the tie out of the door, the train came to a stop, and Hall’s hand was caught between the end of the tie and the facing of the door of the car. The car was an ordinary box-car with side doors, so that the workmen could not tell when the train was going to stop. While Hall and his fellow-workman were in the act of throwing the tie from the car, after giving it a swing, the train was stopped with a sudden jerk, which caused his hand to be caught between the end of the tie and the door-facing of the car. Tbe work-train took up all slack when it was stopped. The jerk <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>was of a more sudden and violent kind than was usual when the train was stopped.</p>

    <p id="b153-3" data-blocks='[["BL_153.4",153,[216,986,1209,867]]]'>'But it is insisted by counsel for the defendant that the evidence is not legally sufficient to sustain the verdict within the principles of law above announced. We cannot agree with counsel in this contention. The complaint alleges and the answer admits that, at ,the time the plaintiff was injured, and for several years prior thereto, the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company was a corporation engaged in the business of transporting passengers and freight for hire as a common carrier by railroad in interstate commerce from Coffeyville, Kan., to Little Rock, Ark. It appears from the testimony of two of the witnesses for the plaintiff that, at the time the plaintiff was injured, he was unloading ties from a work-train, and that the ties were to be used for the purpose of repairing the railroad track. The work was being done on the Mulberry and Dyer sections between Mulberry and Van Burén, in the State of Axkansas.</p>
    <p id="b153-4" data-blocks='[["BL_153.5",153,[224,1875,1203,451]]]'>The section foreman of the defendant testified that he had been working for the defendant as section foreman for twenty-six years, and was with the work-train on the morning the defendant was injured. On cross-examination he was asked how long he had been working for the defendant, and answered twenty-six years. He was then asked this question: “On that same section?” and replied, “No sir, from Van Burén to Little Rock.”</p>
    <p id="b154-2" data-blocks='[["BL_154.3",154,[293,368,1201,410]]]'>
      <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>. It is fairly inferable from this evidence that the defendant was injured on the main line of defendant’s road from Coffeyville, Kansas, to Little Rock, Arkansas, and that he was injured between Mulberry and Van Burén, Arkansas, while unloading ties to be used in repairing the main track of said railroad. This established a cause of action under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, if the defendant was guilty of negligence.</p>
    <p id="b154-3" data-blocks='[["BL_154.4",154,[290,790,1203,1024]]]'>It is also inferable from the testimony that the work-train where the plaintiff was working when he was hurt was stopped with a more sudden jerk than usual, and that this caused him to, in a manner,.lose control of his end of the tie, so that his hand was caught between the tie and the door-facing of the car. It appears that the plaintiff had been working there for two or three days, and the jury might have inferred that he was accustomed to the ordinary jars caused by the ordinary stoppage of the work-train and could take care of himself in that situation. According to his testimony, a different situation presented itself by the work-train’s being stopped with a jerk more sudden and violent than usual. This, as above stated, caused him to lose control of his movements to a certain extent, and caused his hand to be caught between the tie and the door-facing, just as he was preparing to help throw the tie out of the car, after having given it a swing. The testimony of the plaintiff then made a question for the jury as to the negligence of the defendant.</p>

According to the testimony of the plaintiff, he was injured on July 8, 1921, and it appears from the record that the case was called for trial on the 28th day of September,' 1922. The plaintiff testified that his hand could not be used for five or six months after it was hurt, and that it was still swollen. He further stated that his thumb <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>bends back in a way that is not normal; that he can work it with his other hand and can only close his hand in a certain way.

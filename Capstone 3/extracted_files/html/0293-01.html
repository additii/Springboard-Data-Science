Handing his five-gallon can to McDonald to be filled with kerosene, McGuire went away, leaving his can with McDonald, and, returning shortly, paid McDonald 45 cents for the oil, being the regular standard price for kerosene. McGuire took the oil home and had used very little of it on December 4th. He put some of it in a stove in the potato house, but was not able to say that the container was empty when he put the newly purchased oil in. He also put some in an oil lamp, which contained a small amount of oil, and he noticed that there was a peculiarity about the way the wick of the lamp burned when he raised the globe, the blaze would run up high, and he would have <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>to turn the wick down for about a half minute and then turn it back up gradually after putting on the globe.</p>
    <p id="b316-3" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[303,447,1202,392]]]'>On December <em>4, </em>while McGuire was away in the woods at work, Mrs. McGuire undertook to build a fire under the wash boiler in the back yard, and the can of oil exploded, with disastrous results to her. The explosion was heard by persons half a mile away, who thought it was from dynamite being used on the highway; and those who appeared on the scene soon afterwards could not tell much about the occurrence.</p>
    <p id="b316-4" data-blocks='[["BL_316.5",316,[301,858,1202,535]]]'>Mrs. Palman said the explosion threw Mrs. McGuire 10 feet away from the kettle, where she saw some of the remains of her burned clothing. McGuire went out to the kettle after he reached home and picked up the oil can about 12 to' 16 feet away from the kettle and the bottom had been blown out of the can. Oil had been splashed all over a pile of oak heater wood about 20 feet from the wash pot and had burned over the pile of wood. The pot was turned over on its side, and there was nothing left around it but a few splinters and a small pile of chips underneath.</p>
    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.6",316,[299,1415,1203,437]]]'>Some of the fluid had been drawn out of the can by Mr. McGuire into a bottle and carried to the woods for oiling saws. This bottle was corked with a bunch of pine needles and the oil sprinkled through on the saws prior to the explosion, and'the common test of putting a small quantity on paper and then touching a lighted match to it disclosed that it was much more volatile and inflammable than kerosene, which was subjected to the same test at the same time.</p>
    <p id="b316-6" data-blocks='[["BL_316.7",316,[299,1873,1199,245]]]'>A flash test and a chemical test were both made by Dr. Rose, chemist, and proved that the fluid was gasoline. The explosion itself seems to confirm this finding, as otherwise the fluid should not have exploded in the open air on a cold day, according to Rose’s statement.</p>
    <p id="b316-7" data-blocks='[["BL_316.8",316,[295,2130,1200,296]],["BL_317.1",317,[171,334,1203,296]]]'>Dr. Rose, who made the analysis of the sample of the fluid, testified upon a question embracing the allegations of the answer and the other proof relative to the explosion that, if the fluid had been kerosene or coal oil of the grade permitted to be sold by the statute, it would not have ignited and exploded under such circumstances. It <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>should not have exploded unless the temperature of the kerosene had been raised to the igniting point, which would have taken some time and heat would have had to have been applied to the can; and that, even if the kindling surrounding the wash pot was burning, his answer would not be changed.</p>
    <p id="b317-3" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[170,636,1203,297]]]'>Joe McDonald, one of the defendants, denied that he drew the fluid from the wrong faucet, either at the station or out of his tank wagon; stated there were three faucets for delivering the products sold, oil, gasoline, etc., and that he himself unlocked the kerosene tank when it was delivered into the tank wagon.</p>
    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[171,947,1200,145]]]'>Jelly Warren, whose duty it was to deliver the oil from the storage tanks of the oil company at their depot, did not testify.</p>
    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[168,1106,1203,348]]]'>The test of the fluid as analyzed by Dr. Rose showed it contained 96 per cent, of gasoline and ignited at a temperature of 88 degrees, when the statute <em>(§ </em>5903, Crawford <em>&amp; </em>Moses’ Digest, as amended by act 77 of 1923) provides that, if the fluid ignites at a temperature of less than 140 degrees, it shall not be offered for sale for illuminating and heating purposes.</p>
    <p id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.7",317,[166,1466,1204,849]]]'>The manager of the oil company and some of its chemists testified about the details of making the test for determining when petroleum oil meets the required standard for gasoline and kerosene, and also about the location and capacity of this storage tank from which sales and deliveries are made. Said that if the fluid, as analyzed by Dr. Rose, contained 96 per cent, gasoline, it would be very dangerous to use in a potato house stove or lamps, and he doubted if it would burn in kerosene lighting equipment without causing a fire; said the company knew what was put into the tanks to be delivered, but that no test was made after it was put into the tank wagon of McDonald. That the company should know about the ingredients of every liquid that went into its storage tanks; said the fluid could have been tested at every point except on delivery at the tank trucks and the wrong fluid might have been delivered.</p>
    <p id="b317-7" data-blocks='[["BL_317.8",317,[167,2318,1201,99]],["BL_318.1",318,[300,336,1202,747]]]'>No witness who could have known testified that the fluid put into the tank wagon as coal oil came from the <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>kerosene storage tank. No one saw McDonald draw it from that tank, and the can could have been filled with gasoline by McDonald by opening the wrong faucet or it could have resulted from a mistake in loading the gasoline tank. The fluid delivered to McGuire was not kerosene, but about 96 per cent, gasoline, flashed in a test at a temperature of 88 degrees and on a cold day in the open air exploded, causing the death of appellee’s wife. It certainly was not kerosene of the grade required by the statute for heating purposes, and it makes no difference where the mistake was made, since it was made by appellant or its agents, whether in loading the tank truck or in filling the oil can; and the testimony is sufficient to show the delivery of the gasoline to appellee, and no error was committed in refusing to direct a verdict.</p>

    <p id="b684-5" data-blocks='[["BL_684.5",684,[201,863,1253,1170]]]'>¶63 The jury heard two completely different versions of what happened in this case and had the chance to evaluate the credibility of the defendant, the accuser, and the other witnesses. According to the State’s theory, Colbert raped K.P. when she went to his apartment looking for cigarettes. According to the defense theory, Colbert and K.P. had been having a secret sexual affair for a few weeks when K.P. suddenly decided to tell her boyfriend about the affair and then successfully enlisted her boyfriend and another friend in a conspiracy to frame Colbert for rape. The State’s theory was supported by the overwhelmingly consistent testimony of six separate witnesses. None of these witnesses was successfully impeached on cross-examination. The defense theory, on the other hand, was supported by two witnesses. One of these witnesses, investigator Bowers, provided testimony that was largely speculative. The other, Colbert, offered a version of events that was permeated with internal inconsistencies and, with respect to K.P.’s bedroom door, directly contradicted by physical evidence. In light of this testimony, I cannot conclude that Colbert was actually and substantially prejudiced by the erroneous instruction on consent.</p>

In a direct appeal, where the State would have to prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt, a burden-shifting error on this central issue might well result in reversal. But in this collateral attack, Colbert bears the <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>burden of proving that the error more likely than not affected the outcome. <em>Brockie, </em>178 Wn.2d at 539.

Instead, it is based in significant part on statutory interpretation. I therefore respectfully dissent from the decision that <em>W.R. </em>does not apply retrospectively to this PRP. I concur in the majority’s result, however, because I conclude that Colbert has not shown that he was actually and substantially prejudiced by the instructional error in this case.</p>

        <em> </em>Colbert is correct that our most relevant precedent is <em>In re Personal Restraint of Grasso, </em><a href="/wash-2d/151/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="223" data-cite="151 Wash. 2d 1" data-case-ids="428178" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/151/0001-01">151 Wn.2d 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20P.3d%20859" class="citation" data-index="224" data-cite="84 P.3d 859">84 P.3d 859</a> (2004) (plurality opinion). That case, like this one, involved the retroactivity (under RCW 10.73.100(6)’s time bar) of a holding with both statutory and constitutional aspects. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12 (considering retroac-tivity of holding in <em>State v. Rohrich </em>that child hearsay statute required child witness to actually testify since “[t]he Legislature intended the child hearsay statute to be constitutional and ‘carefully drafted [it] to avoid any confrontation clause problems,’ ” <a href="/wash-2d/132/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="225" data-cite="132 Wash. 2d 472" data-case-ids="498162" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/132/0472-01">132 Wn.2d 472</a>, 476-81, <a href="/citations/?q=939%20P.2d%20697" class="citation" data-index="226" data-cite="939 P.2d 697">939 P.2d 697</a> (1997) (second alteration in original) (quoting Judy Yun, Note, <em>A Comprehensive Approach to Child Hearsay </em>

Rev. 1745</a>, 1766 (1983))). But because <em>Grasso </em>is a fragmented opinion and presented a different procedural posture—in <em>Grasso, </em>the petitioner’s case was not final before <em>Rohrich </em>was decided—I agree with the majority that it does not control the outcome here. Majority at 621-22; <em>Grasso, </em>151 Wn.2d at 11-12 (lead opinion) (concluding that <em>Rohrich </em>had both a statutory and constitutional holding), 21-24 (Madsen, J., concurring) (concluding that <em>Rohrich </em>holding was purely statutory), 25-26 (Sanders, J., dissenting) (concluding that <em>Rohrich </em>was hybrid holding). I disagree with the majority, however, that <em>Grasso </em>is distinguishable from this case for any other reason. <em>See </em>majority at 622 (asserting that this case implicates a rule of purely constitutional dimensions, whereas <em>Grasso </em>implicated statutory interpretation). The lead opinion in <em>Grasso </em>specifically distinguished the statutory and constitutional components of the <em>Rohrich </em>holding and concluded that the statutory components alone triggered retroactive application under our precedent. <em>Grasso, </em>151 Wn.2d at 12. While this was arguably dicta, given the procedural posture of the case, it is the most relevant discussion our case law contains regarding the retroactive application of a hybrid holding. And it supports retroactivity in this case.</p>

Alsco and the employees filed cross motions for summary judgment. Alsco argued that it is exempt from paying commissioned workers overtime because it is an RSE for purposes of the overtime exemption in RCW 49.46.130(3). Alsco also claimed it had not willfully withheld wages because the commission-based wage system was negotiated as part of the CBA.</p>

The Court of Appeals explained that the trial court could resolve the remaining issues relatively quickly and that immediate review would not materially advance the ultimate resolution of the litigation. The parties, back in trial court, filed cross motions on the remaining issue of how to calculate the amount of overtime owed to the employees by Alsco. The court granted the employees’ motion and denied Alsco’s. The court calculated the “regular rate of pay” for overtime purposes by dividing the total weekly compensation actually paid by 40 hours rather than all hours actually worked.</p>

    <p id="b400-6" data-blocks='[["BL_400.6",400,[202,1108,1246,584]]]'>¶10 Alsco contends that its commission-based-pay employees are exempt employees under the “retail or service” exemption under the MWA. RCW 49.46.010(6). Washington’s MWA generally requires employers to pay employees one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for any hours worked over 40 hours in a week. RCW 49.46.130(1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> However, at issue here, the MWA expressly exempts employees who work for an RSE if their regular rate of pay exceeds one and one-half times the minimum wage and more than half of the employee’s compensation represents commissions on goods or services.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

It is uncontested that the commission-based-pay employees here are paid over one and a half times the minimum wage and that commissions make up over half of their pay.

    <p id="b401-6" data-blocks='[["BL_401.6",401,[202,991,1252,428]]]'>¶12 RCW 49.46.010(6) defines an RSE as “an establishment seventy-five percent of whose annual dollar volume of sales or goods or services, is not for resale and is recognized as retail sales or services in the particular industry.” It is undisputed that the products sold by Alsco to other businesses are used by the businesses and are not resold to individuals. The dispositive question is whether it is “recognized as retail sales or services in the particular industry.”</p>
    <p id="b401-7" data-blocks='[["BL_401.7",401,[201,1447,1247,696]]]'>¶13 The trial court reasoned that Alsco’s sales are not recognized as retail sales or services in the particular industry because they are to other businesses pursuant to long term contracts and because Alsco lacks a retail concept. The trial court explained that Alsco’s customers may be “the end of the line” in the sense that the customer’s employees wear the uniforms, but they do so only as a means to assist their own employers in their efforts to make a profit by selling their own goods or services to the general public. In essence, the trial court seemingly determined Alsco is not an RSE because it contracts with other businesses on a long term basis. That reasoning misreads the statute.</p>

Alsco primarily asserts the trial court’s determination that Alsco is not an RSE conflicts with our decision in <em>Stahl. </em>In that case, we addressed whether sales of goods and services are recognized as retail in the particular industry. In <em>Stahl, </em>95 percent of the employer’s revenue came from direct sales to consumers, but the question remained whether sales from vending machines were “recognized in the industry” as retail sales. <em>Stahl, </em>148 Wn.2d at 882. We held that vending machine sales are recognized as retail sales by the industry, observing that vending machine sales are subject to the retail sales tax and are “end of the line” transactions between the vending company and the ultimate consumer. <em>Stahl, </em>148 Wn.2d at 882.</p>

    <p id="b402-6" data-blocks='[["BL_402.6",402,[201,1719,1246,421]]]'>This tax treatment factors heavily in deciding the applicability of the RSE exemption. It makes sense that if the business transactions are taxed as being retail, then the business is, in fact, engaged in retail sales under the exemption. Second, Alsco’s sales are “end of the line” sales. None of Alsco’s goods or services are resold. This also weighs heavily in the RSE determination. These factors are those on which <em>Stahl </em>focused.</p>
    <p id="b402-7" data-blocks='[["BL_402.7",402,[200,2174,1248,197]],["BL_403.1",403,[201,345,1247,467]]]'> ¶16 The distinction between the present case and <em>Stahl </em>is that here, Alsco’s customers are other businesses, which the trial court focused on in its conclusion that Alsco was not an RSE because its business customers used Alsco’s <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>products and services “as a means to assist their own . . . efforts to make a profit by selling their own goods or services to the general public.” Clerk’s Papers at 803. But such a distinction is not found in RCW 82.08.0202. Many businesses sell products to other businesses at retail. That Alsco’s sales are predominately high volume does not control whether those sales are retail. A business can sell services at large volume and still be considered retail. High volume sales do not negate the definition of “retail.”</p>
    <p id="b403-4" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[201,834,1253,1425]]]'>¶17 While Alsco’s “products” do not fit into the category of what one intuitively considers retail, the statutory language controls. Alsco provides its customers three services: (1) the rental and servicing of linens and uniforms, (2) the rental and servicing of washroom and hygiene products, and (3) the direct sale of janitorial products, garments, and linens. These “products” are providing goods <em>and </em>services. The statute applies to both goods and services. The statutory definition of “retail” undercuts the intuitive sense of what is retail. But we are analyzing those statutory definitions. Retail businesses are not limited to establishments where consumers enter, take goods off shelves, and purchase at a register. Retail businesses are also entities that sell “goods and services.” The service here that Alsco provides includes supplying uniforms, towels, and linens that the customer purchases or rents from Alsco. The core of Alsco’s business is selling a “service” in the statutory sense, specifically the rental of linens and garments. The laundering of the product by Alsco could be performed by another company or the customer themselves. Here, the essence of the transaction subject to the sales tax is the providing of the clean linens and uniforms. RCW 82.08.0202 includes “providing customers with a supply of clean linens, towels, uniforms, . . . and similar items, whether ownership of the item is in the person operating the linen and uniform supply service or in the customer,” as a retail sale and subject to retail sales tax.</p>

Where a business rents uniforms <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>to a customer for an event, RCW 82.08.0202 provides that this is a retail transaction. Where the customer is another business, the transaction retains its retail treatment. The statute draws no distinction between individual versus business customers. The laundering and return of uniforms to the customer, under RCW 82.08.0202, is similarly designated a retail transaction. The statutory characterization is not affected or limited based on the duration of the relationship, the volume of business, or the fact that businesses are involved. Under RCW 82.08.0202, no language exists supporting the trial court’s conclusion.</p>

Ed. 2d 694</a> (1966), the Court held that a tire merchant was not an RSE on the basis that it sold tires at discount prices to businesses for use on their vehicle fleets. The employees draw a comparison between Alsco’s large volume contracts and the equipment sold in <em>Idaho Sheet Metal. </em>However, the decision in <em>Idaho Sheet Metal </em>was guided not by the volume of sales in question, but by the secretary of labor’s rule specifying that sales to fleets of five or more vehicles at wholesale prices are not retail sales. <em>Idaho Sheet Metal, </em><a href="/us/383/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="383 U.S. 190" data-case-ids="6168808" data-case-paths="/us/383/0190-01">383 U.S. at 208</a>.

Mar. 31, 2008) (court order), held that sales to other businesses pursuant to long term contracts—in that case, pest extermination services— were retail sales. The employees attempt to distinguish this case by pointing to the facts that the exterminators were free to set their own schedules, which would allow them to “game” the overtime system, and that they were skilled workers, so the company could not hire more workers to avoid overtime. However, whether the employees do or do not control their schedules is not helpful in deciding whether the exemption applies. As we discussed in <em>Stahl, </em>an employee’s job duties do not affect whether he or she is paid a bona fide commission for purposes of the retail service exemption. An employee who has no involvement in sales is exempt from overtime as long as the employee’s commission is tied to the amount charged to the customer and the remaining requirements of the exemption are met. <em>Stahl, </em>148 Wn.2d at 886-87.</p>

But the employees cite no authority that the RSE determination turns on who receives the benefit.

All four of these cases rely on a definition of an RSE under a section of the FLSA that was repealed in 1989. Pub. L.

Under the previous subsection 213(a)(2) of the FLSA, RSE was defined to include those employers who operated only on a small scale in the local community, so-called “mom and pop” businesses. Subsection 213(a)(2) did not require that employees be paid on a commission basis because that section was not concerned with the exempt status of employees paid on a commission, unlike the exemption at issue here. Significantly, Congress repealed subsection 213(a)(2) in 1989. Pub. L. No. 101-157, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20Stat.%20939" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="103 Stat. 939">103 Stat. 939</a>. Federal courts in those previous cases necessarily found that the businesses were not RSEs because the definition of an RSE was much narrower. Since this provision was repealed, these cases are not helpful. High volume sales no longer control; a business now can sell a larger or smaller quantity of goods and services, which does not negate the definition of “retail.”</p>

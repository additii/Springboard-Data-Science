While the'im-pounder of stock under the act is allowed any damages sustained by him caused by such animals, nevertheless we are convinced, after a careful consideration of the act as a whole, that 'all of the provisions of the' act relating to damages may be eliminated, and a perfect workable act will remain. If seems clear to us that the Legislature would have enacted this statute, ■ after all the provisions as to damages had been eliminated; if if had known that these provisions rendered the act unconstitutional. If the act be unconstitutional, it is only so because of these provisions as to damages, and section 12, as we construe it, is a declaration of the purpose of <a id="p698" href="#p698" data-label="698" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*698</a>the Legislature not to permit the act to become invalid because of sudh provisions.</p>

It becomes therefore unnecessary to decide, and we do not decide, whether or not the act would be unconstitutional if the provisions as to damages were retained therein, because the appellants here do not raise an issue as to the (amount, if any, or the manner of ascertainment, of damages. No testimony is abstracted by the appellants showing that any damages were incurred, or laid and proved, specifically, as such.</p>

The appellants contend that the election was void because the notice was not given as required by law.

In that case we said: “It follows from these decisions that, where nothing is involved except the contest of the result of an election, the circuit court has jurisdiction. This, however, does not exclude the jurisdiction of the chancery court under all circumstances. On the contrary, we are of the opinion that, where property or contractual rights are involved in the result of an election putting into force a statute like the one involved in this inciuirv, the .ebaneerv court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the contest and to afford relief where the statute has not been properly put into force. * * * We do not think that the validity of the statute authorizing the formation of the district is affected by the fact that the statute makes no provision for a contest of the election. If a remedy exists in any óf the courts under the Constitution and <em>general laws </em>of the State, the special statute is not invalid by reason <a id="p699" href="#p699" data-label="699" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*699</a>of its failure .to provide .a remedy.” That opinion was rendered in February, 1923, and this action was instituted thereafter on April 4,1923.</p>

As the act does not make any specific provision for instituting a contest, nor when same may be instituted, nor how it may be conducted and determined, it was undoubtedly the intention of the Legislature in these respects to. make the provisions of the general election laws •apply where applicable. As wé have seen by the section above quoted, the general election laws provide for á limitation upon the time when election contests shall be commenced, and that limitation is six months for all other officers except the Judges of the Supreme Court. Surely the Legislature did not intend that as. important a matter as the time for contesting an election held under this act should be left unlimited — “in the air,” so to speak. <a id="p700" href="#p700" data-label="700" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*700</a>The serious results that would follow such construction are outlined in the appellees’ plea of laches. It occurs to us that actions such as this instituted in the chancery court to contest the result of 'an election under the act are analogous to any contest that might be brought under the general election laws to contest an election of officers, and that the same limitation should apply.. Under this interpretation there are definite and fixed rules governing such contests. Otherwise, there are no rules applicable thereto.</p>

In the case before us the act is very broad and comprehensive. It is' complete in itself, and in no manner attempts to amend or change the existing election laws. On the contrary,’ the general election laws are undisturbed and are in no wise affected by § 5433’ pertaining to municipal elections. It is no objection to the statute that, in order to ascertain how elections in cities and towns shall be held, it becomes necessary to refer to existing laws relative to holding general elections for State and county officers” (Citing oases).

However, I concur in the judgment of affirmance on the ground that there was substantial compliance with the statute with respect to notice of the election. There was publication in a daily newspaper more than thirty days before the election, and three subsequent publications in a weekly newspaper. The printed notices were posted in the township, as required by statute. The daily and the weekly newspapers were the same publications by the same concern except that one was issued daily and the other weekly, and the publication for the first time in the daily instead of the weekly was, I think, a mere technical omission, which did not affect the validity of the election.</p>

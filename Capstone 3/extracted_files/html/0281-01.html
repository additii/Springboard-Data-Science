His wife, Nina Martin, tried to sue the company that installed the machine, but that company no longer existed. It was difficult for Martin to discern which company was now responsible for the installation company’s liability because the merger and acquisition history of the installation company was particularly complicated.

Nina Martin filed a wrongful death and survival action on June 29, 2007 within the three-year statute of limitations. In the complaint, Martin named several defendants, most relevant here being “General Construction Company dba/fka Wright Schuchart Harbor Company,” and she served General Construction Company (GCC) with the summons and complaint on July 5, 2007. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 394-95. Martin alleged that Wright Schuchart Harbor Co. (WSH) installed the machine, known as Tissue Machine No. 5 (TM5), that killed Donald and that GCC was its corporate successor.</p>

In its answer, GCC included a third party claim for indemnity against Fletcher General. The third party complaint discussed the stock purchase agreement and stated that because of the agreement, the Fletcher entities were liable “[t]o the extent that the Plaintiffs’ claims arise out of work <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>performed by Wright Schuchart Harbor Company.” CP at 3549.

The complex history is as follows. When WSH installed the TM5 in 1981, WSH was a subsidiary of Wright Schuchart Inc. (WSI). Also in 1981, WSI purchased the assets of a “closely held corporation known as General Construction Company.” CP at 2451. Thus, WSH and GCC were subsidiaries of WSI. In 1987, WSI was sold to Fletcher Construction Company (Delaware) Limited. Fletcher Construction Company (Delaware) Limited was a subsidiary of FCCNA, and FCCNA was a subsidiary of Fletcher Challenge, a New Zealand multinational corporation. In 1993, Fletcher Challenge merged several of its subsidiaries, including WSI (which included WSH and GCC as subsidiaries) into Fletcher General. Fletcher General assumed WSH’s preexisting liabilities. In 1996, Fletcher Challenge sold the majority of Fletcher General’s assets to Fletcher General’s managers and the managers created a new company named “General Construction Company.” CP at 2439. Thus, there are two GCCs. Originally, GCC was a subsidiary of WSI. That GCC merged into Fletcher General in 1993. However, a new GCC formed in 1996 when Fletcher General’s managers purchased the majority of Fletcher General’s assets and used those assets to form a completely different company named GCC. This new GCC is the company Martin sued in 2007 before the statute of limitations expired. Fletcher General continued to exist as a company, and Fletcher General agreed under the asset purchase agreement to assume all of its preexisting liabilities occurring before July 1, 1996. In 2001, Fletcher General merged into <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>FCCNA and FCCNA thereby assumed Fletcher General’s preexisting liabilities.</p>
    <p id="b322-5" data-blocks='[["BL_322.5",322,[211,460,1244,268]]]'>¶7 Thus, GCC’s main argument for its summary judgment motion was that Martin sued the wrong party — GCC was not a successor in interest to WSH under the asset purchase agreement. On January 13, 2011, the trial court granted GCC’s summary judgment motion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b322-6" data-blocks='[["BL_322.6",322,[211,749,1247,1176]]]'>¶8 On January 22, 2010, Martin filed an amended complaint, adding FCCNA as a defendant. On November 23, 2010, FCCNA filed a summary judgment motion to dismiss it from the case based on the statute of limitations. To defeat FCCNA’s summary judgment motion, Martin made three separate arguments as to why her amended complaint was timely: (1) it related back under CR 15(c) and her failure to name FCCNA was not due to “inexcusable neglect,” (2) naming GCC/WSH tolled the statute of limitations under RCW 4.16.170, and (3) under the discovery rule, her cause of action did not accrue until she learned FCCNA’s identity. The trial court granted FCCNA’s motion. The trial court held that (1) the claim did not relate back under CR 15(c) because the plaintiffs did not demonstrate excusable neglect in identifying FCCNA as a defendant, (2) the statute of limitations was not tolled because naming WSH did not identify FCCNA with “reasonable particularity,” and (3) the claim was not timely under the discovery rule because even if the discovery rule applies to this case, the plaintiffs did not demonstrate reasonable diligence in ascertaining FCCNA.

It seems Martin incorrectly thought that WSH and GCC merged together to form “new General” and that “new” <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>GCC was thus the successor. <em>Id. </em>at 53. However, the trial court found nothing in the record to indicate what kind of search Martin made, and it also found that a combination of publicly available documents would have pointed Martin to FCCNA or another Fletcher entity. The public information before the trial court was information provided by FCCNA, and it included (1) a certificate of amendment and an articles of merger filed with the secretary of state linking WSI, Fletcher General, and FCCNA together, (2) a 1993 <em>Seattle Times </em>article that said WSH was going to become a Fletcher subsidiary named “Fletcher Construction Co. Northwest” and that GCC would become part of Fletcher General, and (3) a 2010 screenshot of GCC’s website that details its history, including that the current GCC managers bought GCC in 1996 from Fletcher Challenge and “the company was again renamed General Construction Company.” CP at 729, 731, 733-34, 736-37.</p>

St. Ass’n, </em>96 Wn.2d at 368-69; <em>S. Hollywood Hills, </em>101 Wn.2d at 78. In line with those cases, we clarify that the defendant bears the initial burden of showing neglect by producing evidence that the defendant’s identity was easily ascertainable by the plaintiff. Once the defendant has produced that evidence, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to give a reason for failing to ascertain the identity of the defendant. If the plaintiff fails to give a reasonable excuse or show that he or she exercised due diligence, it is inexcusable neglect.</p>
    <p id="b327-4" data-blocks='[["BL_327.5",327,[116,953,1250,807]]]'>¶20 This clarification of the defendant’s and plaintiff’s burden is consistent with the primary textual focus of CR 15(c), which is the defendant’s notice of the lawsuit rather than the plaintiff’s diligence. In fact, the phrase “inexcusable neglect” does not appear in the text of CR 15(c). We originally adopted the “inexcusable neglect” requirement from the federal courts and their analogous federal civil procedure rule. We note that the United States Supreme Court has now eliminated “inexcusable neglect” from its analogous rule. <em>See Krupski v. Costa Crociere S.p.A., </em><a href="/l-ed-2d/177/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="560 U.S. 538" data-case-ids="12454862,3641809" data-case-paths="/l-ed-2d/177/0048-01,/us/560/0538-01">560 U.S. 538</a>, 541, <a href="/l-ed-2d/177/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="560 U.S. 538" data-case-ids="12454862,3641809" data-case-paths="/l-ed-2d/177/0048-01,/us/560/0538-01">130 S.

Although some of the publicly available documents could have pointed Martin to <em>a </em>Fletcher entity, it would have been difficult for Martin to realize FCCNA specifically was the proper defendant under the available information during the limitations period. Unlike <em>Haberman, </em>where the defendants’ identity was readily available from any one of a number of sources, here the only information in the record that would have pointed <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>to a Fletcher entity was a combination of (1) a 1993 <em>Seattle Times </em>article that stated WSH was going to become a Fletcher subsidiary named “Fletcher Construction Co. Northwest” and that GCC would become part of Fletcher General and (2) documents on file with the secretary of state showing the link between WSI, Fletcher General, and FCCNA. CP at 729, 731, 733-34. However, no single document could have directly connected WSH and FCCNA, and even a combination would not have cleanly connected the dots between the two.</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[209,899,1251,1144]]]'>¶22 The Court of Appeals was incorrect when it stated that the record showed that “the articles of amendment changing the name of WSH to Fletcher General Inc.” was publicly available and that GCC’s publicly available website should have put Martin on notice. <em>Martin, </em><a href="/wash-app/178/0646-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="178 Wash. App. 646" data-case-ids="4348156" data-case-paths="/wash-app/178/0646-01">178 Wn. App. at 667</a>. There is nothing in the record from the secretary of state’s office connecting <em>WSH </em>to Fletcher General; rather, the record shows <em>WSI </em>merging into Fletcher General, and there are no public documents connecting WSI and WSH. Additionally, the printout from GCC’s website is dated “2010” and is thus irrelevant to what Martin knew or should have known in 2007 when she filed suit. CP at 737. Thus, nothing in the record shows that the identity of FCCNA and its connection to WSH was easily ascertainable during the limitations period. Because FCCNA failed to demonstrate that its identity and relationship to WSH was easily ascertainable during the limitations period, Martin did not need to give a reason for failing to identify FCCNA. The trial court thus erred by requiring Martin to demonstrate due diligence before FCCNA had made a showing that its identity was easily ascertainable.</p>

Martin met the textual requirements of CR 15(c), and the record does not indicate that FCCNA’s identity was easily ascertainable during the limitations period. Martin’s failure to name FCCNA was a mistake due to a particularly complicated corporate history, and FCCNA had actual notice of the lawsuit during the limitations period. Accordingly, her amended complaint relates back under CR 15(c) and is thus timely. We reverse the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>

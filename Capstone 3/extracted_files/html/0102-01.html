Indeed, the provision was amended in 1995 to specifically address the act of luring minors into a secluded area, whether or not the area is a structure. H.B. Rep. on S.B. 5039, 54th Leg., Reg. Sess.

Second, the dissent dismisses concerns that the statute will be applied against protected speech, finding that there is little possibility that innocent parties (a student inviting peers to his or her house, a good Samaritan offering a ride, a bus driver, etc.) will be prosecuted. Dissent at 115. But selective enforcement does not cure overbreadth. Indeed, a danger inherent in overbroad statutes is that such statutes provide unbridled administrative and prosecutorial discretion that may result in selective prosecution based on certain views deemed objectionable by law enforcement. <em>Little v.

Last, we question whether the affirmative defense protects the statute from an overbreadth challenge (dissent at 115) because it applies only after prosecution has begun. Accordingly, it alleviates neither the risk that protected speech will be “chilled” nor the danger of selective enforcement. <em>See also Ashcroft v.

The interaction must be viewed as a whole, and the majority improperly focuses on his words in isolation to find sufficient evidence.

    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.6",156,[218,1701,1252,539]]]'>¶28 The plainly legitimate sweep of RCW 9A.40.090(1) outweighs the concern that legitimate speech may be encroached on by its enforcement. Children and the developmentally disabled are the most vulnerable members of our society, and the luring statute protects them from some of the most evil types of criminal activity, such as child abduction. The State has a very strong interest in protecting its most vulnerable from such attacks. That strong interest must be balanced against the concern that protected speech will be punished or chilled under the law.</p>

      <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>¶29 Homan does not meaningfully engage in this necessary balancing. Rather, he offers several absurd examples of potentially affected speech while ignoring the requirement that there must be a “realistic danger” that the statute will curtail protected speech. <em><a href="/us/466/0789-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="466 U.S. 789" data-case-ids="6206324" data-case-paths="/us/466/0789-01">Id.</a> </em>For example, students will not fear a luring prosecution when inviting other students over to talk about school. <em>See </em>Resp’t’s Second Suppl.

Similarly, an adult would likely drive a critically injured child to the hospital without concern of a luring prosecution. <em>See <a href="/us/466/0789-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="466 U.S. 789" data-case-ids="6206324" data-case-paths="/us/466/0789-01">id.</a> </em>And school bus drivers need not worry that prosecutors will bring luring charges when the driver tells students to “hop in” at a bus stop. <em>See <a href="/us/466/0789-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="466 U.S. 789" data-case-ids="6206324" data-case-paths="/us/466/0789-01">id.</a> </em>The statute is not designed to target these innocent interactions.

    <p id="b157-4" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[90,1186,1249,928]]]'>¶30 Additionally, the affirmative defense portion of the statute protects individuals from prosecution for innocent communications with children and the developmentally disabled. It is an affirmative defense to luring if the defendant shows that his or her “actions were reasonable under the circumstances and the defendant did not have any intent to harm the health, safety, or welfare of the minor or the person with the developmental disability.” RCW 9A.40.090(2). Whether or not this section protects the statute from an overbreadth challenge on its own, it weighs on the side of validity because it significantly limits the realistic danger that the luring statute will significantly compromise recognized free speech. <em>Members of City Council, </em><a href="/us/466/0789-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="466 U.S. 789" data-case-ids="6206324" data-case-paths="/us/466/0789-01">466 U.S. at 801</a>. Realistically, it is doubtful that the statute <em>significantly </em>compromises free speech. The realities of its application in innocent contexts, taken with the affirmative defense clause, sufficiently protects free speech.</p>

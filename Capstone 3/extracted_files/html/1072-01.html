    <p id="b1094-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1094.6",1094,[293,1182,1198,501]]]'>He denied that there was ever any modification whatever of the contract for the construction of the garage; admitted that he had gone to appellee the day following thé signing of the contract, because of some unexpected development in his financial condition, and asked to be released from it, and appellee refused to release him, giving as one reason therefor that he had already ordered by wire the special tile for the roof of the garage. • He exhibited a letter from appellee, dated the 20th of July, in which he stated:</p>

Neither did appellee deny that he had told appellant, on the day following the signing of the contract, when appellant requested to be released therefrom, tliat he would not permit such release because he had already ordered the tiling for the roof by wire. He only said that he did not recall having made such statement.</p>
    <p id="b1095-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1095.5",1095,[114,975,1200,651]]]'>The burden of proof was upon appellee to show a substantial compliance with the obligations of his written contract before he could require a specific performance thereof by the appellant. The written contract embodied the agreement of the parties, and its terms are not to be contradicted by parol testimony. If a modification of the contract for performance was agreed to, as claimed by appellee and denied by appellant, it devolved upon the appellee to prove such modification. This court, which tries the case <em>de novo, </em>holds that he has not discharged such burden, and that the chancellor’s finding otherwise is contrary to the preponderance of the testimony.</p>

Appellant was insisting, under the terms of the contract, that a tile roof for the garage was required.</p>

    <p id="b1096-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1096.4",1096,[343,452,1199,389]]]'>It is undisputed that the garage was not built of brick veneer construction; that it would cost about $1,000 more to change it from stucco to brick construction, and appellant and some of the witnesses thought it detracted materially from the appearance of the premises; one, a contractor, stated that the premises are worth $2,000 less because of the stucco construction, than if the garage had been built of brick veneer.</p>
    <p id="b1096-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1096.5",1096,[343,857,1199,245]]]'>This constituted a very material failure of performance of the contract by appellee, who could not therefore compel a specific performance of it by appellant, having been guilty of a breach thereof himself.

It is so ordered.</p>

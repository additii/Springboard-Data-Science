The defendants in their answer denied that they were engaged in the business of operating a warehouse <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>or that they received plaintiff’s property in that capacity, and denied that the property was lost by reason of any negligence on the part of the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b36-3" data-blocks='[["BL_36.4",36,[253,534,1195,872]]]'>There was a sharp conflict in the testimony concerning the circumstances under which defendants received plaintiff’s property and the agreement between them with respect to it. It is uncontradicted that some time during the month of January, in the year 1918, plaintiff received at Helena certain bundles or packages containing the articles in controversy, which had been shipped to her from Cincinnati, Ohio. The packages were shipped to Helena by steamboat. The defendants were agents at Helena for the steamboat company and received all consignments of freight to the city of Helena. Defendants were also engaged in the transfer business in the. city of Helena, hauling goods and other property for hire. On receipt of the bill of lading and on the arrival of the goods plaintiff’s husband gave the bill of lading to defendants and the goods were placed in the upper story of the elevator building, defendants having their office in the lower story.</p>
    <p id="b36-4" data-blocks='[["BL_36.5",36,[238,1429,1208,966]]]'>The contention of plaintiff is that the defendants accepted the goods for hire and expressly agreed, in consideration of the payment of the charges, to keep the goods as warehousemen. On the other hand, defendants contend that they were not engaged in the warehouse business, but were merely agents for the steamboat company and were engaged in hauling for hire, and that at the request of plaintiff and merely for her accommodation, they permitted her to place the goods in the second story of the elevator building without any agreement with respect to safely keeping the same. They contended that they did not operate a warehouse there, but had permitted several persons to temporarily place goods in the second story of the elevator building, and one of the defendants testified that they kept a watchman on guard at the building and that he visited the second story of the building occasionally to see that everything was in order, and that there was no combustible matter, so as to avoid the outbreak of fire.</p>
    <p id="b37-4" data-blocks='[["BL_37.3",37,[228,394,1200,407]]]'>
      <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>Plaintiff did not discover the loss of the goods until about a year after they had been placed in the building, and then made immediate demand for their return or payment, which was refused, and this suit was instituted. The property consisted of a davenport, of the alleged value of $65, a roll of bedding, towels, kitchen utensils, scarfs, chafing dish, an electric iron, and certain other articles, the whole being of the alleged value of $231.50.</p>
    <p id="b37-5" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[230,820,1201,869]]]'>The court, at the request of the defendants, submitted to the jury the question whether defendants received the property as warehousemen to keep the same for hire, or whether merely as a gratuitous bailee. The court told the jury, in an instruction given at the request of defendants, that, if they permitted the plaintiff to store the goods in the building for accommodation only, without compensation, the only duty that defendants owed the plaintiff with reference to the goods was to exercise slight degree of care in protecting the same, and that if the goods were stolen from the building while defendants were exercising such care there would be no liability. The verdict being in favor of the plaintiff, we must treat it as having settled in plaintiff’s favor the question whether or not defendants received the goods as bailee for hire. But the court went further and gave the following instruction, over the objections of defendants:</p>
    <blockquote id="b37-6" data-blocks='[["BL_37.5",37,[236,1706,1201,406]]]'>‘ ‘ If, on the other hand, you find from the evidence in this case that the defendant company was a bailee for hire, that is, that the goods were stored by. plaintiff with the defendant company and the defendant was to make a charge, or to charge for the storage of the goods, and they were lost while in the possession of the defendant company, then you will find for the plaintiff for the value of the goods, as shown by the evidence.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b37-7" data-blocks='[["BL_37.6",37,[236,2131,1202,251]],["BL_38.1",38,[250,369,1209,1013]]]'>This instruction told the jury, in substance, it will be observed, that if the defendants were bailees for hire, and if the goods were lost while in the possession of the defendants, the latter were liable for the value of the goods. It was error, we think, to give this instruction, <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>for, even though the defendants were bailees for hire, they were only liable for negligence. <em>Bertig </em>y. <em>Norman, </em><a href="/ark/101/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="101 Ark. 75" data-case-ids="1310975" data-case-paths="/ark/101/0075-01">101 Ark. 75</a>. It is true that, according to the testimony adduced, the defendants were placed in exclusive possession of the property, and it devolved upon them to explain the loss before the plaintiff could be put upon proof as to negligence. <em>Phoenix Cotton Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Pettus &amp; Buford, <a href="/ark/134/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="134 Ark. 76" data-case-ids="1573303" data-case-paths="/ark/134/0076-01">134 </a></em><a href="/ark/134/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="134 Ark. 76" data-case-ids="1573303" data-case-paths="/ark/134/0076-01">Ark. 76</a>. But there was evidence adduced bv the defendants tending to explain the loss of the goods and also tending to show that the same were lost without negligence on the part of the defendants. In other words, there was legally sufficient evidence to warrant a submission to the jury of the question whether or not the loss was explained and occurred without fault or negligence on the part of the defendants. This being true, it was the duty -of the court to submit those issues to the jury, rather than take them from the jury by the instruction given, which, in substance, told the jury that the defendants were liable if they held the goods as bailees for hire.</p>

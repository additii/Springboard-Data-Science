In the first place, this court is committed to the rule that, where grave public interests are involved in a question, the court may waive every point except that of determining the constitutionality of the act. <em>Trammell </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em><a href="/ark/37/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="37 Ark. 374" data-case-ids="1870961" data-case-paths="/ark/37/0374-01">37 Ark. 374</a>, and <em>McClure </em>v. <em>Topf </em>&amp; <em>Wright, </em><a href="/ark/112/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="112 Ark. 342" data-case-ids="1538852" data-case-paths="/ark/112/0342-01">112 Ark. 342</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20S.W.%20174" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="166 S.W. 174">166 S.

The appropriations would be made in the same manner as a fund collected from a property tax.

The court quoted with approval from <em>Stockdale </em>v. <em>Atlantic Insurance Co., </em>20 Wall. (U. S.) 323, 331, in sustaining a provision in a prior income tax law, which was claimed to be retroactive in character, the following: “The right of Congress to have imposed this tax by a new statute, although the measure of it was governed by the income of the past year, cannot be doubted; much less can it be doubted that it could impose such a tax on the income of the current year, though part of that year had elapsed when the statute was passed. The joint resolution of July 4,1864, imposed a tax of five per cent, upon all income of the previous year, although one tax on it had already been paid, and no one doubted the validity of .the tax or attempted to resist it.” See also <em>People ex rel. </em>v. <em>Travis, </em><a href="/ny/231/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="231 N.Y. 339" data-case-ids="92401" data-case-paths="/ny/231/0339-01">231 N.

It would extend this dissenting opinion to unusual length should the writer attempt to set'out all the palpably discriminatory features in the act.

This is so because, in my opinion, the emergency clause purported to be attached to the act which passed both houses of the General Assembly was an insufficient emergency clause to put the act into immediate force and effect. The Constitution, as amended, requires that facts be stated by the Legislature which constitute the emergency declared by it. This amendment was passed to prevent the evil which had grown up of attaching emergency clauses to all acts, even though an emergency did not exist. The purpose and intent of the amendment was to require the Legislature to state facts which really justified the declaration of an emergency. The emergency clause purported to be attached to the act which passed both houses of the Legislature was, in substance, like the emergency clause attached to the act which this court had before it for construction iu the case of <em>Cumnock </em>v. <em>Little Rock, </em><a href="/ark/168/0777-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="168 Ark. 777" data-case-ids="8725201" data-case-paths="/ark/168/0777-01">168 Ark. 777</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=271%20S.W.%20466" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="271 S.W. 466">271 S.

      <a id="p908" href="#p908" data-label="908" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*908</a>“Having reached the conclusion that the proviso is not self-executing, it becomes necessary for me to pass upon the validity of the act of the Legislature of 1925 attempting to put the proviso in question in operation. Section six provides that the act is immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, and that the same shall take effect and be in force upon its passage. The reason given that it is declared an emergency is that, by reason of the heavy indebtedness hanging over many cities o'f the first class, they will be unable to procure proper facilities for the extinction of fires, proper police protection, and proper safeguards for the public health. This declaration on the part of the Legislature is a mere conclusion on its part. By an amendment to the Constitution of the State, adopted on the 11th day of November, 1920, the limitation upon the legislative power in declaring an emergency to exist is made. The section specifically provides that it shall be necessary to state the facts which constitute the emergency allowing the Legislature to put an act into immediate effect. The mere fact that cities and towns are largely in debt contains no statement of the facts of an emergency. I do not think that the legislative declaration of an emergency is final under the provision of the Constitution referred to, and am of the opinion that its action is subject .to judicial review.

The writer of this dissent is also of opinion, from an inspection of the engrossed and enrolled act before the court for construction, that it is impossible to tell whether the emergency clause, or what emergency clause, was attached to the act by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the General Assembly. It is alleged in the complaint <a id="p909" href="#p909" data-label="909" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*909</a>and conceded in the demurrer that the emergency clause to the engrossed and enrolled act was not the one attached to the original act as amended and engrossed which passed both houses of the General Assembly, but that, after' the passage of the original act as amended and engrossed, the emergency clause now attached to the engrossed and enrolled act was substituted, without a vote of either house, for the one that both houses adopted and passed. Such a substitution, if made, was necessarily a fraudulent one under the allegation of the facts in the complaint. If it be conceded that the facts, alleged in the complaint and admitted in the demurrer must be viewed in the light of the record, an inspection of the engrossed act reflects that the last page thereof, upon which the emergency clause appears, is written on older paper than the body of the act, and in slightly different type; and that the last page of the enrolled act upon which' a part of the emergency clause appears fails to bear the red ink page number which the other pages bear in their order, and that the page next to the last one upon which the first part of the emergency clause appears is written over words which have been erased. It is true that the records in the passage-of a law are the only evidences admissible to test its validity, but this rule of evidence is necessarily based upon the presumption that the records themselves are genuine, and not forgeries. If the records supporting the passage of a law are forged, the law must fall, as fraud vitiates everything, even to the highest and greatest legislative enactment. A law cannot escape the penalty of invalidity if it or a material part thereof is a fraudulent substitution for the law which actually passed both houses of the general .Assembly. An inspection of the engrossed and enrolled act in question shows that the emergency clause attached thereto has been tampered with, and, in my opinion, this is enough to destroy the integrity of the emergency clause and justify a court in declaring that the act passed without an emergency clause being attached, unless it can be shown that the emergency clause <a id="p910" href="#p910" data-label="910" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*910</a>attached was the one adopted by a two-thirds vote of both, houses. In the present condition of the record the court should temporarily enjoin the enforcement of the laws, just as it would if no emergency clause had been adopted or attached to the act.

Here the parties appeared in court and contested the claim of the plaintiff, and the circuit court properly overruled their motion to dismiss the appeal.

These instructions required the jury to find, before returning a verdict for the plaintiff, that appellant’s car was being driven at a speed so great as to constitute negligence and that this negligence was the proximate cause of the injury. The testimony presented this issue, and was sufficient to support the finding of the jury that appellant was negligent in this respect.</p>

For the lack of testimony to support the recovery of these items the judgment must be modified to exclude them, but, as no other error appears, the judgment as thus modified mil be affirmed.</p>

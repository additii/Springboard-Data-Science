    <p id="b263-5" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[217,590,1206,450]]]'>But it is insisted that this ground for a new trial is established by other evidence than that of the jurors themselves. The only other evidence on the point is that of the publisher of the daily newspaper, who testified that three of the jurors were subscribers to the paper. This testimony falls short of showing that the article in question commenting on the case was read by the jurors. Hence we hold that this assignment of error is not well taken.</p>
    <p id="b263-6" data-blocks='[["BL_263.5",263,[219,1062,1204,247]]]'>The next assignment of error is that the court erred in allowing the State to introduce in evidence a motion for a, continuance, subscribed' and sworn to ¡by the defendant, for the purpose of contradicting- his testimony. We think that this assignment is well taken.</p>
    <p id="b263-7" data-blocks='[["BL_263.6",263,[223,1323,1204,405]]]'>The court admitted the motion for a continuance in evidence for the purpose of impeaching the defendant as a witness. Section 4187 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest relates to the mode of impeachment of witnesses. Among other things it provides that a witness may be impeached by the party against whom he is produced, by showing that he has made statements different from his present testimony.</p>

    <p id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[314,650,1204,510]]]'>In the later case of <em>Baker </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/85/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="85 Ark. 300" data-case-ids="1523327" data-case-paths="/ark/85/0300-01">85 Ark. 300</a>, it was held that, where the defendant filed an application for continuance on account of the absence of a certain witness, in which he alleged what the witness would swear if present, which application was refused, and the witness subsequently appeared and testified somewhat differently from defendant’s statement in the application, it was error to permit the application to be read for the purpose of impeaching the defendant, if such application did not conflict with defendant’s testimony.</p>
    <p id="b264-6" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[308,1174,1205,394]]]'>That case exactly fits the present one. At á former term of the court the defendant had filed a motion for a continuance, in which he set out the testimony of three absent witnesses. The motion was subscribed and sworn to by him. The case was continued for another term. At the trial of the case two of the witnesses testified to a state of facts somewhat different from the facts set out in the defendant’s motion for a continuance.</p>
    <p id="b264-7" data-blocks='[["BL_264.6",264,[304,1591,1204,394]]]'>The.motion for a continuance referred to is somewhat lengthy, and we do not deem it necessary to set it out. It is sufficient to say that it was introduced by the State for the purpose of impeaching the defendant. The defendant was a witness in his own behalf, and there is nothing whatever in the motion for a continuance which contradicts the testimony of the defendant given at the trial.</p>
    <p id="b264-8" data-blocks='[["BL_264.7",264,[299,2006,1205,249]]]'>Under the authorities cited above, it is well settled that pleadings in a case subscribed by a party can only be used to impeach him as a witness where such pleadings or statements are contradictory to the evidence given by the party at the trial.</p>
    <p id="b264-9" data-blocks='[["BL_264.8",264,[300,2270,1200,96]],["BL_265.1",265,[204,375,1216,1011]]]'>This rule was recognized by this court on the former appeal. One of the grounds for a reversal was that the <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>trial court erred in allowing the prosecuting attorney to read the defendant’s motion for a continuance in his argument to the jury, where it did not appear that the motion was introduced in evidence. The court said that, if the State desired to use the motion to contradict the testimony of the defendant, and thus to impeach his testimony, it should have introduced the motion as evidence in the case. That was tantamount to saying that the motion could not be introduced in evidence unless it tended to contradict the testimony given by the defendant. If it was prejudicial to allow the prosecuting attorney to read the motion for a continuance to the jury where it had not been introduced in evidence, it would be equally prejudicial to allow it to be introduced in evidence where it did not tend to contradict the evidence of the defendant, and thus become a mode of impeaching him as a witness. The general rule is that evidence improperly admitted must be treated as prejudicial unless there be something to show that it was not. <em>Elder </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/69/0648-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="69 Ark. 648" data-case-ids="8725859" data-case-paths="/ark/69/0648-01">69 Ark. 648</a>.</p>
    <p id="b265-3" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[220,1403,1206,451]]]'>The fact that the State insisted bn reading the motion for a continuance in evidence, over the objections of the defendant, showed that it was believed by the prosecuting attorney that it would affect the jury unfavorably to the defendant. Then, too, the jury might have considered that it tended in some measure to corroborate the testimony of the two witnesses mentioned in it, who, as above stated, testified to a somewhat different state of facts to those recited in the motion for a continuance.</p>
    <p id="b265-4" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[219,1875,1206,198]]]'>For the error in allowing the motion for a continuance to be read in evidence for the purpose of impeaching the defendant as a witness, the judgment will be reversed, and the cause will be remanded for a new trial</p>

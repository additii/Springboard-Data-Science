Shamis was engaged in the mercantile business in Malvern, Ark.,' until some time in October, 1917. On the 26th day of October, 1917, T. A. Shamis made a general assignment in favor of his creditors. The general assignment was introduced in evidence, but we do not deem it necessary to copy it in our statement of facts. We need only say that, in general terms, it conveyed to certain designated trustees ’all the real and personal property of Shamis in trust for the benefit of his creditors, and the deed of assignment was duly signed and acknowledged before a notary public by Shamis and the assignees named in it. A few days after this, an involuntary pe<a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>tition in bankruptcy was filed against Sbamis in tbe Federal bankruptcy court.

One hundred and seventy-seven creditors filed claims in tbe Federal court in bankruptcy. Shamis filed bis application in said court for a discharge, and, upon bearing tbe same, it was denied.

It appears from the record that all the creditors of Shamis, who are plaintiffs in the present suit, filed their claims in the Federal bankruptcy court and that that court ordered paid to them about forty per cent, of the amount of their claims. It was also shown that an additional per cent, of their claims was paid them, so that each creditor received 42.7 per cent, of the amount of his claim.</p>

The Federal court in bankruptcy denied the petition of Shamis for a release against his creditors, and for that reason the creditors could maintain a suit to recover the balance due them -after having received their <em>pro rata </em>part in the distribution of his assets in the Federal bankruptcy court.</p>

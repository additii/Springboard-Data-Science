The withdrawal of the name of Hill and the names of the other persons did not affect the jurisdiction of the court, because there was still left upon the petition more than ten names, as required by the statutes. Under these circumstances it has been generally held that names may be withdrawn at any time before the tribunal in which the petition is filed in some way acts or determines the sufficiency of the petition.

A signer of a petition for the establish<a id="p1063" href="#p1063" data-label="1063" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1063</a>ment of an improvement district cannot revoke Ms act except for cause shown.</p>

Each petitioner acted on his individual responsibility, and, if he should change his mind on the question of whether the road should be vacated or not, he had a right to do so at any time before the county court acted upon the petition. Besides this, the record shows that Hill and the other remonstrants signed the petition upon the representation that the road described in it was the old road leading from' the main public road to the ferry formerly owned and operated by J. M. McClintock. When they found out that they had signed the petition upon a misrepresentation of fact and that the road in question was the one leading to the east and west approaches of the bridge across White River, they had a right to correct their mistake, because the petition had not been acted on by the county court before they withdrew their names.</p>

Thus it will be seen that the two sections of the statute operate in entirely different fields. There is a material difference in laying out a new road 'and making* changes and alterations in a public road, and in vacating it.</p>

In the one case the road is kept up, leading to the principal points, although it may be, by alteration, upon different ground from that on which it was first located. In the other it is abolished altogether, the authorities are exempted from keeping it in repair, and it may be stopped up entirely. Hence it was said that the Kentucky statute providing for a discontinuance of an established road did not apply to the ease of an alteration.</p>

    <p id="b1081-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1081.7",1081,[178,1604,1200,658]]]'>The judgment vacating the property was erroneous for another reason. It will be noted that § 5247 provides that, when any county road or any part of any county road shall be considered useless, it may be vacated by a proper petition filed in the county court. Under the statute the portion of the road could only be vacated when it was considered useless. The question of whether the part of- the road asked to be vacated had become useless was one of fact to be determined on the evidence. The question of the utility or non-utility of the part of the highway asked to. be vacated was therefore one for judicial determination, which could not be arbitrarily exercised by the county court.</p>

The court will take judicial notice' that White River is a navigable river, and, if the approaches of the public road which connect with the bridge across that river should be vacated, the use of the whole road would be materially affected, and the use of the bridge as a means of crossing the river would be entirely abolished. Therefore it will be seen that, as long as the bridge is used as a part of the State Highway and as a means of crossing White River, the public road leading to the bridge on each side of it cannot, in the very nature of things, be considered useless, and it was erroneous for the county court to so hold. As a practical matter, those parts of the public road which are used as approaches to the bridge can never be considered useless as long as the (bridge is a part of the public highway for crossing White River. The circuit court affirmed the judgment of the county court vacating the road, and thereby adopted the view of the matter held by the county court, and committed error in so holding.</p>

That is to say, the judgment of the circuit court will be that the order of the county court vacating the road in question will be reversed, and the county court ordered to dismiss the petition of J.

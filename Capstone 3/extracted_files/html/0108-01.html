First, it calls attention to subdivision b of § 11 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, 11 USO A, § 29 (b). That simply provides that the court may order the trustee to enter his appearance and defend any impending suit against 'the bankrupt. This was not a suit against the bankrupt, but a suit begun by McGill Brothers, who afterwards went into’bankruptcy, and we know of no provision - of the Bankruptcy Act that prohibits trustees in bankruptcy from being substituted or joined as parties plaintiff.</p>

The instruction would not be erroneous for this reason. It simply told the .jury that the questions at issue, naming them, were all questions of fact for them to determine, and that the burden of proof was on the appellees.</p>
    <p id="b138-5" data-blocks='[["BL_138.6",138,[297,1664,1200,293]]]'>The next objection is that it unduly, emphasizes the evidence and theory of the plaintiffs. We do not agree with appellant in this contention. The instruction merely recites the facts pleaded by the appellee, telling the jury what is claimed by the plaintiff, 'but does not emphasize the evidence in any way.</p>
    <p id="b138-6" data-blocks='[["BL_138.7",138,[297,1980,1200,360]]]'>It is next contended that the instruction in effect quotes the theory of the plaintiffs, and nowhere states the theory of the defense. It is not usual in requesting instructions by either party to state the theory of the opposing party, and in this case the theory of the appellant was stated in a number of instructions and so plainly that the jury could not have been misled.</p>

The jury were told in the instruction complained of that the appellee must prove by a preponderance of the testimony, among’ other things, that appellees had suffered a loss of $1,106.85, but, in giving the jury the form of a verdict, the amount of the recovery, if they found for the plaintiff, was left blank.</p>
    <p id="b139-3" data-blocks='[["BL_139.4",139,[163,813,1201,247]]]'>The court instructed the jury at appellant’s request that, if they found the shipment was tendered to consignee under the terms and provisions of the bill of lading, and was rejected for no cause occurring or happening in transit, they would find for the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b139-4" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[161,1073,1205,346]]]'>They were also told at the request of the appellant that, if they found from the testimony that only such inspection took place at Cincinnati as was customary and usual under consignment shipments allowing inspection, then they would find in favor of the defendants, regardless of who had possession of the bill of lading during the period of such inspection.</p>
    <p id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.6",139,[162,1432,1203,286]]]'>The jury also were instructed that a delivery is not made until notice has been given the consignee, and a reasonable time allowed for its unloading or rejection, and, if the jury found that within a reasonable time the consignee rejected the shipment, they must find for the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b139-6" data-blocks='[["BL_139.7",139,[161,1739,1202,144]]]'>They were also told in an instruction requested by appellant that the measure of damages was the fair market value of the rice at destination point.</p>

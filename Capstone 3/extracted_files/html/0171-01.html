It requires us to answer two questions, certified to this court by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, about Washington’s farm labor contractor act (FLCA), chapter 19.30 RCW. The first question implicates RCW 19.30-.010(2). That statute defines a “farm labor contractor” as “any <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>person, or his or her agent or subcontractor, who, for a fee, performs any farm labor contracting activity.” Another FLCA provision, RCW 19.30.010(3), then defines “farm labor contracting activity” as “recruiting, soliciting, employing, supplying, transporting, or hiring agricultural employees.” The second question implicates RCW 19.30.200. That statute imposes joint and several liability for FLCA violations on “[a]ny person who knowingly uses the services of an unlicensed farm labor contractor” and then states, “In making determinations under this section, any user may rely upon either the license issued by the director [of the Department of Labor &amp; Industries (Department)] to the farm labor contractor under RCW 19.30.030 or the director’s representation that such contractor is licensed as required by this chapter.”</p>

The agreement left the details of orchard management largely to NW’s discretion, but it provided that NW would “operate and use the orchard Properties for the sole purpose of conducting a first-class agricultural operation,” and it required NW to submit to Farmland a yearly “Farm Operating Plan” that included NW’s anticipated budget for the coming year.

The plaintiffs allege, in part, that Farmland and the Hancock companies are jointly and severally liable for NW’s violations under RCW 19.30.200 because they used the services of an unlicensed farm labor contractor without either inspecting NWs license or verifying licensure with the Department.</p>

The trial court denied the motions, concluding that the FLCA imposes an affirmative duty on such defendants to verify proper licensure. All the defendants then moved for summary judgment on the ground that NW was not a “farm labor contractor” as defined in RCW 19.30.010(2) because it was instead an “agricultural employer” (defined in RCW 19.30.010(4)). The district court also denied that motion, concluding that those two definitions are not mutually exclusive.</p>

The district court granted the motion and awarded the plaintiffs damages of $500 per class member per violation per year worked, for a total of $1,004,000.

The first certified question: Does the FLCA, in particular RCW 19.30.010(2), include in the definition of a “farm labor contractor” an entity who is paid a per-acre fee to manage all aspects of farming—including hiring and employing agricultural workers as well as making all planting and harvesting decisions, subject to approval—for a particular plot of land owned by a third party? Answer: Yes</p>
    <p id="b232-7" data-blocks='[["BL_232.7",232,[202,1564,1247,369]]]'>¶13 As noted above, RCW 19.30.010(2) defines a “farm labor contractor’” as “any person, or his or her agent or subcontractor, who, for a fee, performs any farm labor contracting activity.” Another FLCA provision in turn defines “farm labor contracting activity” to mean “recruiting, soliciting, employing, supplying, transporting, or hiring agricultural employees.” RCW 19.30.010(3).</p>
    <p id="b232-8" data-blocks='[["BL_232.8",232,[202,1957,1246,422]],["BL_233.1",233,[202,345,1247,264]]]'>¶14 NW is a farm labor contractor under the plain language of these provisions. Pursuant to their sublease agreement, Farmland paid NW a per-acre fee “[a]s compensation for the services rendered by [NW] under this Agreement.” ESR at 43. And pursuant to that agreement, those services included “hiring], employ[ing], discharging] and supervising] the work of all employees and independent contractors performing labor and/or services on the ‘Prop<a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>erties’.” ESR at 38. That contractual arrangement places NW squarely within the plain definition of “farm labor contractor” under the FLCA: at a minimum, NW “employ [s]” and “hir[es] agricultural employees” in exchange “for a fee.” RCW 19.30.010(3), (2).</p>
    <p id="b233-3" data-blocks='[["BL_233.4",233,[202,634,1245,98]]]'>¶15 The defendants make two main arguments to support their contrary interpretation of the statute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b233-4" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[201,758,1247,1179]],["BL_234.1",234,[201,345,1253,649]]]'>¶16 First, the defendants point to a provision in the FLCA making that chapter inapplicable to “any person who performs any [farm labor contracting activities] only within the scope of his or her regular employment for <em>one </em>agricultural employer on whose behalf he or she is so acting, unless he or she is receiving a commission or fee, which commission or fee is determined by the number of workers recruited.” RCW 19.30.010(6) (emphasis added). The parties refer to this provision as the single-employer exemption. The defendants don’t argue that the single-employer exemption actually applies to NW; they argue, instead, that the logic <em>underlying </em>the exemption applies equally to entities like NW. They contend that the legislature exempted single-employer contractors from FLCA coverage because “their ties to one farmer ensured the requisite stability, permanence, and accountability” and that NW possesses all of those qualities, having worked almost exclusively for Farmland and in the same general area for roughly 20 years. Br. of Defs.-Pet’rs at 22-23. Their unstated conclusion is that these attributes make them as deserving of an exemption as someone actually eligible for the enacted single-employer exemption. But the legislature is the body <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>that gets to make that policy decision by defining “farm labor contractor.” RCW 19.30.010(2). If NW fits the definition of a “farm labor contractor,” RCW 19.30.010(2), and is not eligible for any statutory exemption, then it must abide by the FLCA’s licensure requirements. We have no authority to read a new exception into the statute on policy grounds. <em>See Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Cmty., </em>572 U.S. _, <a href="/us/572/0782-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="134 S.

They contend that the FLCA embraces a “Tripartite Scheme” that distinguishes between three <em>mutually exclusive </em>categories: “Agricultural employer” (farmer), “Agricultural employee” (workers), and “Farm labor contractor” (broker). Br. of Defs.-Pet’rs at 24 (boldface omitted). NW argues that because it is an agricultural employer, it cannot also be a farm labor contractor. But the legislature did not make the three categories of “person” defined in RCW 19.30.010(2), (4), and (5) mutually exclusive. As the district court concluded in this case, “The fact that NW . . . also meets the statutory definition of‘agricultural employer’ is irrelevant; [if it was] paid by a third party to ‘recruit,’ ‘employ’ and ‘supply’ farm laborers, <em>see </em>RCW 19.30.010(3), it was required to register.” ER at 41.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

They argue that the second sentence (which lists two ways of determining whether a farm labor contractor has a license) creates a “safe harbor” for persons who rely on a license or the Department’s representation of licensure, but does not create any affirmative <em>duty </em>to verify licensure. Br. of Defs.-Pet’rs at 39-43. Accordingly, they conclude that the plaintiffs must prove that the Hancock companies and/or TMP had actual or constructive knowledge that NW was unlicensed in order to establish joint and several liability under RCW 19.30.200.</p>
    <p id="b236-4" data-blocks='[["BL_236.4",236,[202,1044,1252,777]]]'>¶20 The plaintiffs argue that RCW 19.30.200 gives the term “knowingly” a specific meaning: that a person “knowingly” uses an unlicensed farm labor contractor if he or she does so without using one of the two methods listed in that statute’s second sentence—inspecting the contractor’s license or inquiring about the contractor’s status with the Department. Answering Br. of Pls.-Resp’ts at 24 (“[a] user is required to make a determination based on one of two [specified] options!, and] [a]fter that determination is made, the user will <em>know </em>whether the labor contractor possesses a valid Washington license”). Thus, the plaintiffs conclude that a person who fails to verify in one of these easy, straightforward ways must be charged with knowledge and is therefore jointly and severally liable under the statute for use of an unlicensed farm labor contractor.</p>

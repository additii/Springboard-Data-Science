Appellee filed answer and cross-complaint in which the allegations in the complaint were denied and asked for divorce and alimony. The trial court granted appellant a divorce and the custody of the child, and held that appellee was not entitled to any alimony, but that she was entitled to one-half interest in the property described, subject to the burden of one-half the indebtedness against it.</p>

The chancellor found that the appellee was the owner of one-half of the property, and we cannot say that his finding is against the preponderance of the evidence.</p>

Appellant^ testified in rebuttal that he owed $700 on the <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>place and $300 on other debts; that the $1,250 mentioned by appellee as having been paid on property was not that much bnt was a little over $1,000. When asked about the partnership that his wife spoke of, he said: “She never did want the property. When we built, she did not want to. I had to give her father a job to get her to sign the mortgage.”</p>

They separated in 1927. He begged her to come back and about March they paid $1,250 for the property, the same property that they bought in 1923. The interest ran it up to $1,250. That since 1923 she had actively taken part in the business at all times. When they talked about buying the property, appellant told her it would be for both of them. They were supposed to be partners in everything since they bought the property. Appellant does not dispute appellee’s testimony that he told her they were buying the property for both of them. There is no contradiction of her testimony that they were partners. Appellant was asked about the partnership, and he did not say they were not partners. The evidence shows that the house was a two-story building, and they lived in the upper story and conducted the business in the lower story. It is clear from the evidence that both appellant and appellee worked and conducted the business which resulted in the accumulation of the property in controversy. It is immaterial whether there was a partnership. If appellee and appellant, by their joint work, labor and management, acquired the property, a court of equity would, even before the recent statutes, protect the wife’s interest in the property. “A question arises as to the validity of the notes of Pillow to his wife. Are they valid ? At common law, contracts between husband and wife are void.

And in paragraph F it classifies injuries as follows: “(1) Injuries, fatal or non-fatal, which produce immediate, total and continuous disability from date of accident, or which make a visible contusion or wound on the exterior of the body. (2) Disability caused partly by <a id="p976" href="#p976" data-label="976" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*976</a>injury and partly by disease shall be classified as disease and paid for as such. ’ ’</p>

The agent delivering the policy testified, as did also the general agent, that policies were sometimes delivered- without payment of the first premium by the insured, the agent taking a chance upon the collection of the premium. It is admitted, however, that the policy was delivered to the insured, and such delivery is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the payment of the first premium, and further the insured’s mere possession thereof is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the first premium has been paid. 32 C. J., § 355, p. 1204; <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Parrish, </em><a href="/ark/66/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="66 Ark. 612" data-case-ids="1909804" data-case-paths="/ark/66/0612-01">66 Ark. 612</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=52%20S.W.%20438" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="52 S.W. 438">52 S. W. 438</a>. Such <em>prima facie </em>case may be overcome, however, but it was not done here by the agent delivering the policy, who testified that the premium was not in fact paid, since two witnesses testified that they saw the insured pay the premium money <a id="p977" href="#p977" data-label="977" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*977</a>when said policy was delivered. Neither does the testimony of the general agent, Mr. Naylor, overcome snch <em>prima facie </em>case, as he stated that the policy was delivered and the company took a chance on the collection where they were delivered on credit. The delivery of the policy without condition without exacting payment of the premium in cash raised the presumption that a short credit was intended. <em>American Employers’ Liability Ins.

    <p id="b997-3" data-blocks='[["BL_997.4",997,[172,815,1202,343]]]'>The presumption that the first premium was paid upon the policy is an ordinary presumption of fact and can he rebutted. The jury decides such questions of facts in the case, and the instruction No. 2, complained of, properly left this for determination by it, and, the jury having found against appellant on this point, its finding will not be disturbed here.</p>
    <p id="b997-4" data-blocks='[["BL_997.5",997,[171,1172,1204,1016]]]'>Appellant next insists, that the ptomaine poisoning from eating unsound food does not constitute a death solely by external, violent and accidental means within the meaning of the policy, and cites <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Inter-State Business Men’s Acc. Ass’n, </em><a href="/iowa/187/0869-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="187 Iowa 869" data-case-ids="2265204" data-case-paths="/iowa/187/0869-01">187 Iowa 869</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=174%20N.W.%20577" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="174 N.W. 577">174 N. W. 577</a>, as authority on this point, but such case appears to be contrary to the weight of authority. It is stated in 5 Couch Enc. of Insurance Law, § 1141, p. 4003: “There are also numerous cases of death or disability incident to the partaking of food or drink and resulting either from poisoning or from disease. In the case of death or disability resulting from the mechanical action of food or drink, the cases are largely agreed that it was by accident or the result of accidental means. And the authorities agree that death directly from poisoning following the unintentional eating of bad but apparently wholesome food is effected by accident, or is the result of accidental means, unless causes of such a character are expressly excepted.” See also 1 C. J., § 78, p. 431, and note 14 thereto, and Vance on Insurance, § 232, p. 566.</p>

This places his death within the provisions of the policy, without regard to whether there was any visible contusion or wound on the exterior of the body. The disjunctive conjunction “or” separates the sentence, and either of the two causes provided would be sufficient to bring the insured within the terms of the policy for accidental death, both not being required. <em>U.

This was a, denial of liability and a waiver of written proof of loss, and there was no error in instruction No. 5, objected to, telling the jury that, if they found that defendant refused to pay anything on the policy for the reason that the premium had not been paid, then it could find that the company was estopped from objecting that the proofs of loss were not furnished in the proper time. <em>Inter-Ocean Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em><a href="/ark/184/0648-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="184 Ark. 648" data-case-ids="1438522" data-case-paths="/ark/184/0648-01">184 Ark. 648</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20S.W.2d%2065" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="43 S.W.2d 65">43 S.

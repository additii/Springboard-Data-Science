    <p id="b1176-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1176.6",1176,[291,742,1209,1613]],["BL_1177.1",1177,[139,383,1202,606]]]'>The pleadings in the case disclose the folloAving facts: The district Avas organized by the county court of Phillips County under the provisions of chapter 109, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, and pursuant to the authority thus conferred the directors of the district have built twenty-four miles of levees alongythe west bank of the Mississippi River to protect the lands of the district from overfloAV by that stream. Prior to the passage of the National Flood Act by the Congress of May 15, 1928, the cost of the levees Avithin the district was borne as folloAA,'s: one-third by the district.and two-thirds by the Federal government. Since the passage of this act the entire cost of construction of levees along the front line of the Mississippi River from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to “Head of Passes” is borne entirely by the Federal government, but the Federal act provides that the local levee districts shall provide, Avithout cost to the United States, all rights-of-Avay for levee foundations and levees. Recent surveys by the corp of engineers of the United States army, having supervision of levee construction, discloses that there are several miles of leAme Avithin the district Avhich avíII haAre to be relocated or set back on account of the caving banks of the Mississippi RiA^er, and tentative contracts have been made by the Federal government with Amrious contractors to build the levees so relocated, but, in accordance Avith the provisions of the flood control act above referred to, the Federal <em>government </em>has demanded of the district’s directors that they acquire, at the cost of the district, the necessary rights-of-Avay and foundations for such relocated levees. The damages to the landoAAmers A\diose lands must be taken for the purposes stated harm been adjusted be<a id="p1157" href="#p1157" data-label="1157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1157</a>tween the district and the landowners, and the sum of money required for this purpose is $50,000. The district can pay these damages only by the issuance of the bonds of the district. It has no money available for this purpose at this time from any other source. On account of the general depression and the lack of a suitable market for securities of this character, the district is unable to sell these bonds except at a great discount, but the landowners have agreed to accept these bonds at par in payment of their damages. The requirements of the statute in the matter of procuring the assent of the landowners to the bond issue have been complied with.</p>
    <p id="b1177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1177.4",1177,[140,1004,1204,552]]]'>The point raised in the landowner’s complaint is that the district has no authority under the law to issue and deliver bonds in payment of this right-of-way. A demurrer was filed to this complaint, and a demurrer was filed by the plaintiff landowner to the answer of the district, and the cause was heard upon these demurrers. The court sustained the demurrer to the complaint and overruled the demurrer to the answer, thus holding, in effect, that, under the allegations of the pleadings set out above, the district had and has the authority to issue its bonds for the purpose stated.</p>
    <p id="b1177-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1177.5",1177,[139,1562,1204,655]]]'>Full power to construct: the levee is conferred by chapter 109, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, title “Levees.” The power is there conferred not only to acquire necessary rights-of-way, but to pay the construction cost of the levees themselves, and pursuant to this power rights-of-way were acquired and the levee constructed. The power to construct and maintain these levees is not exhausted by their original construction, but is a continuing one, and incidental thereto the right exists under the statute to relocate and reconstruct levees, as the exigency of the case may require. It was so expressly decided in the case of <em>West </em>v. <em>Cotton Belt Levee Dist. No. 1, </em><a href="/ark/116/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="116 Ark. 538" data-case-ids="1532289" data-case-paths="/ark/116/0538-01">116 Ark. 538</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20S.W.%20403" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="173 S.W. 403">173 S.

The case of <em>Young </em>v. <em>Red Fork Levee District, </em><a href="/ark/124/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="124 Ark. 61" data-case-ids="1555005" data-case-paths="/ark/124/0061-01">124 Ark. 61</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20S.W.%20604" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="186 S.W. 604">186 S. W. 604</a>, held that the act of February 24, 1905 (Acts 1905, page 143) was a general law and applied to all levee districts in the State, whether organized under general or special statutes. Under § 1 of this act (which appears as § 3933, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest) the power is conferred upon the directors of all levee districts “to enter upon, take and hold any lands or premises whatever, whether by purchase, grant, donation, devise, or otherwise, that may be necessary and proper for the location, relocation, construction, repair or maintaining any line of levees” which may be necessary in promoting the purposes of the district.</p>
    <p id="b1179-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1179.5",1179,[130,1375,1205,349]]]'>There is no allegation that the landowners whose lands are to be taken for the new right-of-way are to be paid an excessive price for their lands, and the good faith of the directors is not questioned.

It was there held that act 279 of the Acts of 1909 did not contemplate that-by a single offering a contract might be ■let for the construction of the proposed improvement, to be paid for in the bonds of the district, by a single bid which disposed of both the bonds and the work. The reason for so holding was that some bidders might desire to bid on the construction work who would not be able to handle a bond issue, while other bidders might not want their purchase of bonds hampered with the contractor’s obligation ■ to construct the improvement, and <a id="p1160" href="#p1160" data-label="1160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1160</a>there would be therefore no common basis for these two classes of bidders.</p>

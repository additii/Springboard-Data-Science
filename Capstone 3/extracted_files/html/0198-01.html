Appellant insists that the court erred in not sustaining its demurrer to the complaint,!since it alleges the policy limited the indemnity in any event to payment of $7 per week for 20 weeks of any one year, but, as the opinion herein shows, we have concluded that no error was committed in overruling the demurrer, this being a suit for damages for breach of the contract, rather than for indemnity under the terms of the policy.</p>

    <p id="b223-4" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[212,1367,1199,822]]]'>It may be true that in case of a lapse of the policy or death of the insured no further claim could be made for a future period of disability as claimed by appellant company, but the limitation of the policy only is to the amount or liability of appellant to the payment of no more benefits in any one year than the 20 weeks as expressly provided. This suit, however, is for damages for breach of a contract, and the jury has found that the contract was wrongfully breached by appellant company, and that the disability here was from an illness or sickness covered by the terms of the policy. The policy provides that the insured must be disabled from performing-work of any nature, confined to'his bed, etc., and certainly such terms do not indicate that it was limited on this point or a policy providing indemnity for partial disability only.</p>

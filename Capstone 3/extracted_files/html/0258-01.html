The killing was accidental, and it was caused by the negligent act of Garrison, committed, however, without any bad motive or ill feeling.

Garrison and Davis were nearly the same age, and were both employed by the express company at Hugo. Garrison had been working there about two years, and Davis had been working there four or five months. Garrison occupied the position designated as depot agent and also as “money clerk,” and Davis was employed to fill the position of “platform man,” his duties being to line-up the trucks for the arrival of trains, to help upload the express matter on trucks and drive the delivery wagons in gathering and distributing the express matter. The office was under the general management of Mr. Talkington, who had an office up town and usually visited the office at the depot every day for the purpose of giving general directions in the operations of the business at that office. There was another man — Snow— filling the same position at the station as Garrison filled, and they worked in shifts. They had charge of the station in the absence of Talkington and handled money and other valuables received for transportation, and there was evidence tending to show that Davis worked under the direction of the one of these station agents on duty at the time.</p>

The young men were g’ood friends and met up-town during the morning and rode together down to the station, and just before noon they lunched, at a near-by restaurant. As they returned from the restaurant to the railroad station, in which the express office was located, they engaged in play, which continued after they reached the <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>station building. The time for the arrival of a passenger train was approaching, and, after tlie play had progressed for awhile, Garrison desired to bring it to an end and went to his office, where he occupied a desk, and told Davis to “line-up tlie trucks.” Garrison went to his room and sat down at his desk to make out' some bills, but Davis persisted in carrying on the frolic. There was a window partially raised in front of Garrison’s desk, and Davis procured a rug, rolled it up and was pushing it through the window at Garrison. Garrison testified that he knew that Davis was afraid of pistols and could be easily frightened with one, so, in order to end the play and cause Davis to go to his work, he took tlie pistol from the place where it lay on the top of the safe, and, after unbreeching it and revolving the cylinder so as to make the hammer rest, as he thought, on an empty cylinder, he presented the pistol at the window, and it was accidentally fired while in his hand. Garrison could not say whether he pulled the trigger or not and was not sure whether he had raised the hammer of the pistol. His testimony was vague and uncertain on this point, but it is clear and undisputed that he took the pistol and presented it toward the window where Davis stood in mimic offensive, and that it was in some way accidentally discharged. There can be no doubt but what he inadvertently left the pistol cocked and pulled the trigger, for he did not drop the pistol, and there was no other way in which the hammer could have been -brought in contact with the shell. The statement of Garrison in his testimony was that he knew Davis was afraid of a gun, “so I just raised the gun up at the window so as to scare him and let him go on with his work.” When the pistol was discharged, Davis cried out in fright and pain, and on examination it was found that the bullet had struck him in the side. He lived a few days, and died from the effects of the wound.</p>

That theory has no application to the facts of the present case, even though in the abstract it be treated as a sound doctrine to the extent stated by counsel. It is certainly not correct to state the rule to be that merely because a substance or instrumentality is dangerous the master is responsible for any use which the servant makes of it. In order to render the master liable, the substance or instrumentality must be in use 'by the servant while discharging his duties to the master, or the injury must result from the inherent dangers lurking in such substances or instrumentality, and not from the voluntary act of the servant in using it for his own purposes. In the present case, if it can be said that a pistol is a thing inherently dangerous, the injury to Davis was not inflicted' on account of the inherent danger, but because of the negligent act of a servant wile using the pistol for his own private purposes. It is charged that the pistol was defective, and, conceding that the proof establishes that fact, it does not alter-the questions of law applicable to the case, for’ even though the pistol was rendered dangerous by the defects, still, if the injury was caused by the servant’s use of it for his own private purposes, the defendant is not responsible.</p>

Two of these cases are decisions of the Supreme Court of Ohio in the cases of <em>Harriman </em>v. <em>Pittsburg, C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co., </em><a href="/ohio-st/45/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="45 Ohio St. 11" data-case-ids="924800" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/45/0011-01">45 Ohio St. 11</a>, and <em><a href="/ohio-st/45/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="45 Ohio St. 11" data-case-ids="924800" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/45/0011-01">Id.</a> </em>v. <em>Shields, </em><a href="/ohio-st/47/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="47 Ohio St. 387" data-case-ids="928358" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/47/0387-01">47 Ohio St. 387</a>. These two cases grew out of the same injury, and separate suits were instituted by two children, almost of tender years, to recover for injuries received. The facts were that torpedoes were furnished to members of a train crew for signal purposes, and one of the members of the crew placed one of the torpedoes on the track, expecting to frighten the passengers when it exploded. It seems that the place where the torpedo was left was near a path traveled by the public, and that when the train moved there was a failure to explode the torpedo and it was afterwards picked up by the children, who were injured in exploding it. Those decisions were based entirely on the ground that the master was responsible where a servant unnecessarily exposed a dangerous substance of that kind so that careless and meddlesome children were injured. We cited the Harriman case with approval in the opinion in the ease of <em>Pittsburg Reduction Co. </em>v. <em>Horton, </em><a href="/ark/87/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="87 Ark. 576" data-case-ids="1519087" data-case-paths="/ark/87/0576-01">87 Ark. 576</a>. We distinguished the case then under consideration from the Harriman case on the ground that the intervening act of negligence of the parent of the child in allowing it to continue to handle and use the explosive was the proximate cause of the injury, rather than the negligence of the servant of the defendant in leaving the explosive exposed at a place where it would likely be picked up by a child. The Harriman case was again cited with approval by this court in <em>St. L. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em><a href="/ark/98/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="98 Ark. 72" data-case-ids="1315975" data-case-paths="/ark/98/0072-01">98 Ark. 72</a>, where torpedoes were put out for signal purposes, and we held that, if there was negligence in putting out the torpedo where it would be exposed to any intermeddling child, the company would be liable for the act of its agent, but that the use of even an explosive substance in a careful <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>maimer, for necessary purposes, would not create liability. Tbe Harriman case was decided on demurrer, and it did not appear in that case that the agent was acting* beyond his authority and for his own private purposes in putting out the torpedo, but that fact was pleaded in the later Shields case, and the Supreme Court of Ohio upheld the liability of the railroad company, notwithstanding the fact that the agent was not acting in the scope .of his employment. The court put the decision on the ground that it was the duty of the company to carefully guard the dangerous substance so that others would not be injured by exposure to it. There was language used in the opinion in the Shields case that has some tendency to support the theory of' counsel for plaintiff in the present case, but that language does not accord with our views of the law, and we do not approve it. In fact, that decision was very much circumscribed by a later decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio in the case of <em>Cleveland T. &amp; V. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em><a href="/ohio-st/63/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="63 Ohio St. 236" data-case-ids="950669" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/63/0236-01">63 Ohio St. 236</a> (<a href="/citations/?q=52%20L.R.A.%20142" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="52 L.R.A. 142">52 L.

It is urged that the court erred in not directing a verdict in appellant’s favor, because the proof did not establish any negligence of appellant company sufficient to support the verdict. “The rule is that a verdict of a jury will not be disturbed by this court on appeal if there is any substantial legal evidence to support it, when viewed in its most favorable light to appellee and when given its highest probative value with all inferences reasonably <a id="p693" href="#p693" data-label="693" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*693</a>deducible.” <em>Standard Oil Co. of La. </em>v. <em>Hydrick, </em><a href="/ark/174/0813-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="174 Ark. 813" data-case-ids="8724769" data-case-paths="/ark/174/0813-01">174 Ark. 813</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20S.W.%20708" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="296 S.W. 708">296 S.

It was also shown that it was not customary to splice the line by making a knot in it, and it was not safe to do so. There was no testimony indicating deceased had any notice that the rope had been spliced by tying a knot in it about twenty minutes before the accident occurred.</p>

The court instructed the jury, however, upon appellant’s request Nos. 6 and 7, that it could not take into consideration said allegations of the complaint, the case being submitted on the one issue, the- safety of the scaffold, the complaint alleging that the scaffold was made unsafe by reason of the knot in the rope.

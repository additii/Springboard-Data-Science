The record as to motion for new trial does not state the date on which it was filed. The indorsement, however, on the motion itself shows that it was filed on October 17. The case was tried on October 11, and appellants attorney states that, at the time the judgment was entered on October 11, he was granted permission to file the motion for a new trial, and was given 60 days in which to file bill of exceptions. He discovered immediately that the judge had failed to note on his docket the filing of a motion for a new trial, overruling the same, and giving 60 days in which to file bill of exceptions. When appellant’s attorney discovered that the record did not show the filing of the motion, he immediately asked the clerk to send the docket sheet to the circuit judge requesting him to make proper entries, and at the same time filed the motion for new trial, dating it on the same day that it should have been presented and overruled; that the circuit judge held the request until several days later when he again opened court at DeWitt, and at that time overruled the motion for new trial.</p>

It is immaterial when it was overruled, so that it was overruled during the same term of court.</p>

It also appears that the court considered the indorsement equivalent to personal service, and to a confession of judgment, in open court, and we must presume that the court acted according to law. Besides, to us the plain meaning of the indorsement is that Nunn thereby entered his appearance to the action begun by the petition, waiving the formality of citation, that is, waiving and in fact acknowledging the notice, the alleged want of which is the subject of Nunn’s second plea.” '</p>

He knew who the plaintiff was, he knew what court the suit was in, and he knew he was defendant, and knew he was being sued for rent, because the instrument prepared by Mr. Carpenter, who represents him, gave the style of the court and the names of the plaintiff and defendant, and was prepared by Mr. Carpenter, his attorney, at his request.</p>

The meaning of the phrase, ‘We hereby enter our appearance to said cause,’ means just what it says, and an appearance in a pending cause signifies an appearance for every purpose in said cause.

The trial court granted BIAW’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case on the ground that there was no material factual dispute and BIAW was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, but it denied BIAW’s request for attorney fees. The Court of Appeals, following reconsideration, ultimately affirmed; it stated in dicta that there was an issue of fact as to whether BIAW met the statutory definition of a “political committee,” but held only that the plaintiffs’ case did not meet the procedural prerequisites to filing a citizen suit. <em>Utter v.

BIAW and BIAW-MSC share the same leadership — BIAW’s president, vice president, first vice president, secretary, treasurer, and immediate vice president are also the officers of BIAW-MSC. BIAW and BIAW-MSC also share the same staff; they are paid by one organization or the other depending on the nature of their work.</p>

Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 175. Under the retro program rules, members can pool their workers compensation risks and, at the end of the reporting period, obtain a refund if the actual claims add up to less than the expected claims. <em>See </em>RCW 51.18.010. L&amp;Í typically pays the refund to BIAW, the organization eligible to receive the refund, and then BIAW deposits the refund into the bank account of BIAW-MSC. A portion of the refund amount is eventually distributed to BIAW’s local associations. BIAW calls its retro program the “Return on Industrial Insurance program” (ROII).</p>

Ultimately, those funds were transferred to ChangePAC, a political action committee.</p>

Plaintiffs alleged that BIAW violated the FCPA by failing to register as a political committee, by improperly coordinating expenditures with Dino Rossi (gubernatorial candidate in 2008), and by exceeding contribution limits. BIAW moved for summary judgment on several grounds.

The <em>WBBT </em>case is extremely complicated and involved complaints by participants in the retro program that BIAW and BIAW-MSC, trustees of the trust, were “retaining interest earned on deposited funds, commingling funds, and failing to provide statutorily required accountings” as well as “violating] their fiduciary duties under the trust agreement in expending funds earmarked for marketing and promotion of the plan.” <em>Id. </em>at 43.

Those are strong words. And even so, there was a vigorous dissent signed by several justices arguing that “this chapter” is entirely unambiguous. <em>Id. </em>at 637 (J.M. Johnson, J., dissenting). By contrast, applying the attribution statutes to the definition of “political committee” would not eviscerate the FCPA or interfere with the express intent of the voters to “(a) [e]nsure that individuals and interest groups have fair and equal opportunity to influence elective and governmental processes; (b) [r] educe the influence of large organizational contributors; and (c) [r]estore public trust in governmental institutions and the electoral process.” RCW 42.17A.400(2).</p>

The initiative’s statement of intent declares that the people intend to accomplish the goals of the initiative “[b]y limiting campaign contributions.” RCW 42.17A.400(2). The initiative itself contains no indication that it would impose expanded reporting requirements related to the definition of “political committee,” and the sections surrounding the attribution section all relate to limits on making contributions.</p>

For example, a political committee has an expectation of <em>“receiving </em>contributions or <em>making </em>expenditures,” RCW 42.17A.005(37) (emphasis added), while a “contribution <em>made by” </em>a person can be considered <em>“made by” </em>a controlling entity under RCW 42.17A.455(2) (emphasis added). Political committees are defined by making expenditures, not making contributions. Cross-referencing is cumbersome, if not impossible. This favors BIAW’s argument that the statutes were never intended to be read together.</p>

As discussed above, <em>Brumsickle </em>upheld Washington’s disclosure laws on the ground that they satisfy the First Amendment’s exacting scrutiny test, which examines whether the law’s requirements “are substantially related to a sufficiently important governmental interest.” <em>Brumsickle, </em><a href="/f3d/624/0990-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="624 F.3d 990" data-case-ids="3794652" data-case-paths="/f3d/624/0990-01">624 F.3d at 1005</a>.

If we interpret the second sentence of RCW 42.17A.455(2) — the attribution rule — to apply to the definition of “political committee,” then that definition of “political committee” is no longer narrowly tailored. A union or trade organization with “a” primary purpose of electioneering, which never received or expected election “contributions” itself but did speak freely to its members about how to vote, could nevertheless become subject to the disclosure requirements. Such an application of the attribution statute would significantly broaden the definition of “political committee” and thus would arguably flunk the First Amendment test under not just <em>Brumsickle </em>but also <em>Buckley </em>(on which <em>Brumsickle </em>is based).</p>

BIAW argues it would be an absurd result to permit both a PDC administrative action and a citizen suit. First, the PDC in this case did not commence any action, administrative or judicial; thus, this question is not presented. Second, BIAW does not explain why that result is absurd. Through administrative enforcement, the PDC may issue orders requiring the respondent “to cease and desist from the activity that constitutes a violation” and “may assess a penalty in an amount <em>not to exceed ten thousand </em>dollars.” RCW 42.17A.755C4) (emphasis added). The amounts at issue in a lawsuit are significantly higher. For example, BIAW-MSC settled the AG’s suit against it for $584,000. When a citizen wins a suit under the FCPA, “the judgment awarded shall escheat to the state,” less the citizen’s costs and attorney fees. RCW 42.17A.765(4)(b). A PDC action thus serves as significantly less of a deterrent to illegal campaign practices.</p>

Nor is this a case in which the PDC failed to act or acted ultra vires.

Majority at 421. The point here is that the PDC’s determination involved analysis of revenue reports as well as the consideration of other evidence including declarations and “interviews under oath” of organization personnel. <em>See </em>note 17, <em>supra. </em>That calculus, which involved the assessment of financial materials, credibility determinations, and the weighing of all such evidence, not only informed the PDC’s determination of culpability as to BIAW-MSC only, but reaching that determination necessarily resolved the question of fact that the majority says is raised here by the reference to “BIAW” in the noted documents. Under these circumstances, we should defer to the PDC’s factual determination. <em>See Hillis, </em>131 Wn.2d at 396 (judicial deference to agency views is appropriate when an agency determination is based heavily on factual matters close to the heart of the agency’s expertise).</p>

Additionally, the PDC determination of the factual question of BIAW’s culpability <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>in my view renders further citizen action to address that issue improper.</p>
    <p id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.5",482,[193,462,1248,638]]]'>¶92 It is time for the parties to move on. In this case, the system (i.e., the statutory scheme of the FCPA as interpreted and employed by the PDC and AG) has worked as intended. Concerned citizens notified the proper authorities about questionable election activity. The agency with expertise in this area investigated, determined culpability, and recommended litigation action to the AG, which the AG pursued, resulting in settlement and correction of the actions that prompted the citizen letter in the first place. In my view, further litigation in this matter is not warranted. Judicial economy compels that we affirm the trial court’s grant of summary judgment.</p>

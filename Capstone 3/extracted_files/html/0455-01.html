Roughly 90 percent of the county is publically owned federal or state park forest area, with only about 3 percent of the county open for private development. Because the county is sparsely populated and developed, the county is statutorily considered 1 of 10 “Counties Planning for Critical Areas and Natural Resource Lands,” or “CARL” counties, in Washington State. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 28. These CARL counties are sometimes referred to as “partial planning counties,” and they are obligated only to designate critical areas and natural resource lands. RCW 36.70A.170; Resp’ts’ Suppl. Br. at 3 n.4. CARL counties are not under the same obligation to fully plan and zone their lands like “full planning” counties. <em>See </em>ch. 36.70A RCW.</p>

The ordinance provided, “In the areas classified as unmapped (UNM) all uses which have not been declared a nuisance by statute, resolution, ordinance, or court of jurisdiction are allowable.” SCC 21.64.020.</p>

According to the ordinance, the purpose of the moratorium was “to maintain the status quo of the area pending the County’s consideration of developing zoning classifications for the areas covered by the newly adopted 2007 Plan and completing the Critical Areas Update Process.” CP at 258. The County intended that the moratorium remain in effect “until the zoning classifications related to the 2007 Comprehensive Plan and the Critical Areas Update Process [were] complete.” CP at 258. The County renewed this moratorium every six months for five years, each time reiterating that the County was still in the process of designating lands consistent with the 2007 Plan.</p>

In a separate suit, the two respondents in this case, Friends of the Columbia Gorge and Save Our Scenic Area (collectively SOSA), challenged the project’s approval on the grounds that it was inconsistent with the 2007 Plan’s conservancy land designation. But the 2007 Plan’s “Conservancy” designation does not impose enforceable restrictions on land use; restrictions are achieved only by zoning. The area is still <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>classified as “unmapped” lands under the 1986 ordinance, and thus this court held that the industrial development was permissible because wind farms had not yet been declared a nuisance. <em>Friends of Columbia Gorge, Inc. v.

With respect to the GMA claim, the court held that the County’s findings of facts contained within the moratorium ordinances — indicating that the County was in the process of updating its forest land designations — revealed a genuine issue of fact as to whether the County actually completed periodic review on August 2, 2005, or whether that review process continued during the moratorium periods. <em>Save Our Scenic Area v.

The Resolution merely designated certain resource lands, pursuant to the County’s obligation under RCW 36.70A.170, and declared that the Resolution itself “meets the requirements of the Growth Management Act (RCW 36.70A) for the conser<a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>vation of forest, agricultural, and mineral resource lands.” CP at 34. The Resolution does not purport to satisfy the RCW 36.70A.130(l)(b) obligation, nor does it even contain the word “review.” The trial court erred in concluding that the Resolution had anything to do with periodic updates of those same critical areas or that it triggered SOSA’s GMA claim.</p>

Although the GMA provides a 60-day appeal period for land use decisions, the statute does not provide any appeal period for claims that arise out of a CARL county’s failure to act. Therefore, we must determine which appeal period should apply. Typically, when a statute does not provide a limitation period, courts may apply an analogous appeal period from other sources of law and when there is more than one analogous appeal period, the longest period is applied. <em>See Yoshio Akada v.

Its provisions often overlap with and integrate portions of the GMA. Relevant to this case, the PEA requires, “Beginning July 1, 1992, the development regulations of each county that does not plan under RCW 36.70A.040 shall not be inconsistent with the county’s comprehensive plan. For the purposes of this section, ‘development regulations’ has the same meaning as set forth in RCW 36.70A.030.[<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>]” RCW <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>36.70.545.

The County made a zoning decision.in 1986 to designate the area as “unmapped” and made another decision in 2007 to classify lands as “conservancy.” Any inconsistency between the 1986 ordinance classification and the 2007 Plan’s conservancy designation existed on July 10, 2007, when the 2007 Plan was adopted. On its face, the 1986 ordinance is a “development regulation,” which is arguably inconsistent with the conservancy designation contained in the 2007 Plan. The County argues that SOSA had 60 days from July 10,2007 to challenge that inconsistency and that their 2012 claim is therefore time barred.</p>

The County unequivocally stated that it needed time to update the unmapped, “free for all” areas to attune them with the newly adopted 2007 Plan’s conservancy designations. Every six months, the County enacted ordinances that suspended building “until the zoning classifications related to the 2007 Comprehensive Plan and the Critical Areas Update Process [were] complete.” CP at 258. The County enacted moratoria in order to maintain the status quo until a final determination could be made. To be clear, we do not hold that the moratoria themselves rendered the 1986 ordinances “temporary”; as we have previously said, moratoria do not suspend appeal periods or enacted laws. But in this case, the County declared the “unmapped” areas temporary until <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>the update process could be completed, hence the need for a moratorium to maintain the status quo. Therefore, there was no final county action to appeal during this period.</p>
    <p id="b523-3" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[96,527,1254,873]]]'>¶27 Now the County claims that SOSA should have nevertheless filed suit earlier, demanding an update to these areas <em>while </em>the County was in the midst of making those very same updates. The problem with this argument is that had SOSA brought the claim in 2007, the County could have successfully argued that the “unmapped” zones were only placeholders while the County completed the update process and that no inconsistency existed until those zones were adopted as final development regulations. The only remedy available had the suit been brought in 2007 would have been a court order to update the ordinances — the very process that the County declared numerous times that it was already undertaking. This lack of appropriate remedy is probative of the fact that this claim was not justiciable until the County decided the “unmapped” classifications were final.</p>
    <p id="b523-4" data-blocks='[["BL_523.5",523,[95,1422,1248,211]]]'>¶28 Second, the PEA’s provision involving the disposition of “unmapped areas” suggests that these classifications are not typically envisioned as permanent fixtures. The statute provides:</p>

Unlike full planning counties, the County is not obligated to set forth zoning classifications by ordinance, and unlike those counties, it retains the prerogative to leave these <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>areas permanently “unmapped.” Although it retains that prerogative, the County reiterated by way of its moratorium ordinances that it intended to update those areas so that they would no longer remain “unmapped.” From 2007 to 2012, these areas effectively lacked any classification, and there was nothing for SOSA to challenge until the County made its final decision.</p>
    <p id="b524-3" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[206,731,1246,317]]]'>¶30 Because there was no final “development regulation” to challenge until August 2012, when the County indicated that it had either completed zoning or was abandoning efforts to update the zones in certain areas, an appealable inconsistency did not exist until that 2012 date.

Failure to act claims may be brought any time after the statutory deadline, and, therefore, the GMA claim is timely. SOSA’s PEA claim is also timely because no actionable inconsistency existed until August 2012, when the County effectively made the “unmapped” classification a permanent status by indicating that the ordinances were no longer temporary. For the above reasons, we affirm the Court of Appeals only in its reversal of the trial court and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

    <blockquote id="b527-4" data-blocks='[["BL_527.5",527,[136,1355,1208,389]]]'>7.6. Skamania County’s failure to zone the Unmapped lands and the County’s failure to protect these lands and their resources from incompatible uses (other than the series of moratorium ordinances that Skamania County has now repealed for the majority of the Unmapped lands) <em>have resulted in development regulations that are inconsistent with the Conservancy designation of the Comprehensive Plan </em>and that violate the consistency requirement of RCW 36.70.545.</blockquote>
    <p id="b527-5" data-blocks='[["BL_527.6",527,[89,1784,1251,141]]]'>CP at 15 (emphasis added). But it does not identify any development regulations that it believes are inconsistent with the Plan.</p>
    <p id="b527-6" data-blocks='[["BL_527.7",527,[89,1955,1250,424]],["BL_528.1",528,[208,347,1245,262]]]'>¶39 SOSA speculates that had it brought its PEA claim in 2007, “the County would undoubtedly have argued that because ... the moratorium ‘maintain [ed] the status quo’ on the affected lands until the County could complete its work and take final action, SOSA’s claims were not yet ripe.” Resp’ts’ Suppl. Br. at 9-10 (second alteration in original) (citation omitted). The majority accepts this speculation, holding that there would have been no “appropriate rem<a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>edy” in 2007, for the alleged inconsistency at issue here: “The only remedy available had the suit been brought in 2007 would have been a court order to update the ordinances — the very process that the County declared numerous times that it was already undertaking.” Majority at 469.</p>
    <p id="b528-3" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[207,629,1248,797]]]'>¶40 Again, I respectfully disagree. We can’t assume that the County would have argued, in 2007, that the development moratorium rendered the PEA challenge unripe. Had SOSA brought a timely PEA claim, the County might well have argued — as it does in this court — that the “[unmapped” zoning designation was entirely <em>consistent </em>with the Plan. Suppl. Br. of Pet’r at 7 &amp; n.20. Indeed, the Plan explicitly identifies the “[u]nmapped” areas as <em>consistent </em>with the Plan’s “Conservancy” designation. CP at 211 (boldface omitted). Had SOSA brought its claim in 2007, we might now have a court order recognizing this consistency and precluding SOSA’s current PEA claim. Or we might have an order granting or denying relief for a different reason. The point is that this matter could have been resolved in 2007, when the County first adopted the Plan.</p>
    <p id="b528-4" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[208,1448,1248,691]]]'>¶41 To be sure, if the County adopts new development regulations that are inconsistent with the Plan, or if it amends the Plan in a manner that renders it inconsistent with existing development regulations, any party may timely appeal that action. But the County has not done this. The alleged inconsistency at issue in this case has existed since 2007 and could have been challenged at that time. The majority’s speculation that the development moratoria prevented SOSA from bringing an action in 2007 is neither supported by the record nor consistent with our precedent. Because I believe that the majority’s holding conflicts with the rule that development moratoria do not suspend appeal periods, I respectfully dissent.</p>

As the trial court noted in its ruling in this case, land use decisions are typically subject to a 21-day or 30-day appeal period. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 415 &amp; n.4 (citing chapter 36.70C RCW (the Land Use Petition Act) and chapter 34.05 RCW (the Administrative Procedure Act)). The County asserts that a PEA claim triggers a 60-day time limit. Pet’Fs Resp. to Amici Curiae Brs. of Futurewise et al. at 2 &amp; n.4. But the statute it cites for this assertion applies to “petitions relating to whether or not an adopted comprehensive plan ... is in compliance with the goals and requirements of the [GMA] or chapter 90.58 or 43.12 RCW” — -it doesn’t address claims that a county has violated a requirement of the PEA. RCW 36.70A.290(2). In any event, we need not decide this question now. Even if we applied the 60-day period available under the GMA, that period has long passed.</p>

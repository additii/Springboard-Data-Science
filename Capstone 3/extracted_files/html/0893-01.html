Berry, as trustees for appellant S. Greisreiter, leased to K. M. Hall a lot or parcel of land 50 feet north and south by 120 feet east and west, in the northeast corner of block 49, Dexter Harding’s Addition to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, at.a monthly rental of $30, payable July 1, 1931, and on the first day of each month thereafter for a term of five years. The lease contained these clauses, among others:</p>

The lessee shall have the right, within thirty days after the expiration of this lease, <a id="p894" href="#p894" data-label="894" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*894</a>or its termination otherwise, to remove the building, provided all rent due at'the time, shall have been paid.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b914-3" data-blocks='[["BL_914.4",914,[283,451,1202,871]]]'>Hall entered into possession and immediately began the erection of the building mentioned in the lease, purchasing certain building material and supplies from appellees, which were actually used in the construction thereof. He failed to pay appellees in full for the material so purchased, and within 90 days from the date of the last item on each of their respective accounts they filed in the office of the circuit clerk affidavits for liens on the building and leasehold interest in the land, describing the property in the affidavit of Standard Lumber Company as “leasehold and building situate on northeast corner of block 49, Dexter Harding’s Addition,” etc., and in the affidavit of Taylor Electric Company as “northeast comer 50 by 120 feet of block 49, Dexter Harding’s Addition, and the building located thereon.” No complaint is made of the description of the land in the affidavit of the other appellee, Barton-Mansfield Company.</p>
    <p id="b914-4" data-blocks='[["BL_914.5",914,[283,1343,1202,725]]]'>Thereafter, on February 2,1932, appellees, Standard Lumber Company and Taylor Electric Company, filed suit in the chancery court to foreclose their liens on the building, the leasehold and the land. Barton-Mansfield Company intervened and sought a foreclosure of its lien. Appellants defended on the grounds hereafter discussed. Hall defaulted in the payment of rent, and on January 5, 1932, appellants brought an unlawful detainer action in the circuit court against him for possession of the property and for judgment for the rent due, which resulted in a judgment in their favor for possession and $120 for rent, and interest on April 20, 1932. Appellees were not made parties to this proceeding, although their affidavits for liens were on file in the proper office.</p>
    <p id="b914-5" data-blocks='[["BL_914.6",914,[285,2090,1199,319]]]'>The decree in this case gave judgment against Hall in favor of appellees for their respective claims which was declared to be a lien upon the building only, prior to the rights of appellants. No lien was fixed upon the leasehold or upon the land itself. This appeal challenges the rights of appellees to a lien on the building.</p>

W. (2d) 759</a>. While it is true that we there held that the relationship between the owner of property and the purchaser thereof under an executory contract of sale and purchase, requiring the purchaser to make certain improvements, was that of owner and contractor and not principal and agent (See also <em>Wildwood Amusement Co. </em>v. <em>Stout Lumber Co., </em><a href="/ark/178/0977-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="178 Ark. 977" data-case-ids="1396973" data-case-paths="/ark/178/0977-01">178 Ark. 977</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20S.W.2d%20911" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="12 S.W.2d 911">12 S.

    <p id="b915-3" data-blocks='[["BL_915.4",915,[169,1339,1201,767]]]'>Here, as we construe the lease, the lessors did not require the lessee to erect the building in question, but consented or stipulated that Hall might do so. The building was to be Hall’s with the right to remove upon termination of the lease with all rents paid. This case is more nearly like that of <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Faubel, </em><a href="/ark/182/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="182 Ark. 304" data-case-ids="1389930" data-case-paths="/ark/182/0304-01">182 Ark. 304</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20S.W.2d%20401" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="31 S.W.2d 401">31 S. W. (2d) 401</a>, where we held that the lessor, by merely consenting that the lessee may make certain improvements, does not subject the fee to a mechanic’s lien, but only the leasehold estate. In other words, in order to reach the fee, the contract must be with the owner or his agent. Appellees had no contract with the owners of the fee, appellants, but only with their lessee, who was not their agent. Therefore no notice to appellants was necessary, as the fee was not involved.</p>

W. (2d) 1114</a>, the late Chief Justice Hart, speaking for the court, said: “We have frequently held that the statute <a id="p896" href="#p896" data-label="896" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*896</a>should receive a liberal construction to effectuate its remedial purposes. All that is necessary is that a person of ordinary understanding should be able to find and recognize the premises intended by the description. The mere fact that more land was embraced in the claim filed by appellee under the statute and in the decree rendered by the court will not of itself invalidate the lien; but it will be good to the extent recognized by the statute. It is sufficient that the description points out and indicates the premises so that, by applying it to the land, the structure into which the materials are placed can be found and identified. <em>Arkmo Lbr.

There is no evidence in this record that each separate purchase was made on a separate contract. The accounts themselves show them to be open running accounts, and all the material and supplies for which liens are claimed were purchased within a short space of time. For instance, the Standard Lumber Company furnished material from June 17 to July 2, a period of 15 days, and something was furnished nearly every day. The Electric Company furnished material and labor from June 22 to October 6, and its affidavit for lien was filed October 19, 1931.

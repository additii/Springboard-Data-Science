It presents two novel questions about the PRA, and additional fact-specific questions. First, we must determine whether a trial court has discretion to calculate penalties for nondisclosure of public records on a per page basis by defining the term “record” to include a single page. Second, we must determine whether L&amp;I investigations qualify for the categorical investigative records exemption we have recognized as necessary for “effective law enforcement.” Finally, this case requires us to decide whether the trial court correctly found that L&amp;I violated the PRA during five separate time periods, and appropriately imposed penalties for each time period.</p>

Since enacting the PRA, the legislature has afforded courts more—not less—discretion in setting penalties for PRA violations. In 1992, the legislature changed the permissible penalty range from not more than 25 dollars, to not less than 5 and not more than 100 dollars. Laws of 1992, ch. 139, § 8.

When the PRA was enacted in 1972, we typically imagined public records as handwritten or typed, hard copy documents.

Five years ago, we held that metadata—“ ‘data about data, or hidden statistical information about a document that is generated by a software program’ ”—can be a public record. <em>O’Neill v.

The trial court is in the best position to make an individual, fact-driven inquiry into what PRA penalties are necessary to achieve the penalty provision’s goal of deterring unlawful nondisclosure. <em>See Yousoufian </em>II, 168 Wn.2d at 462-63. Allowing courts to define “said public record” in a way that makes sense for the particular case promotes the most effective implementation of the PRA.

We affirm the trial court’s imposition of a per page penalty.</p>

We explained, “If the term ‘record’ is interpreted as ‘record,’ then the plain meaning would suggest that courts should assess penalties for every ‘record’ that is requested. However, if the term is interpreted as ‘records,’ then the plain meaning would suggest that courts should assess penalties only for each request regardless of the number of records sought.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=98%20P.3d%20463" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="98 P.3d 463">Id.</a> </em>We examined the underlying purpose of the PRA—promoting access to public records—and determined that it was better served by basing the penalty on an agency’s culpability rather than the size of the plaintiff’s request. <em>Id. </em>at 435.

The PRA allows a trial court to impose a penalty for each day that an individual is denied access to a requested “public record.” While we previously noted that this provision was ambiguous as to whether it meant “public record” or “public records,” I do not see how the provision can be reasonably interpreted to mean all sub-parts of a public record, even when the entire record is withheld. Such an interpretation means that a superior court can subdivide a record into any number of smaller pieces and impose a separate penalty per piece. By this logic, a trial court could impose a separate penalty (of up to $100 per day) for each paragraph, sentence, or even <em>word </em>in a public record. In fact, the definition of a public record can include individual letters, RCW 42.56.010(4), so by the logic of the majority, a trial judge could choose to impose a separate penalty for each individual <em>letter </em>in a public record. This reading of the statute cannot be correct. It strains both logic and common sense, as it would result in no limit on the penalties a trial judge could impose. A 10-page report might contain thousands of words. If an agency wrongfully withholds that report, does the PRA allow a trial judge to calculate a separate penalty for each of those thousands of words? Under the majority’s logic, the answer is yes. I cannot agree.</p>
    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[201,1849,1247,530]],["BL_355.1",355,[201,345,1253,584]]]'>¶77 Amici curiae amply demonstrate the problem with this reasoning when they argue that PRA’s definition of a “writing” is extremely broad, and that if it “includes batches of documents, it must also include pages of documents.” Amicus Br. Mem. of Allied Daily Newspapers et al. at 6. They acknowledge that by that reasoning, a writing can include a single word. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=240%20P.3d%20120" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="240 P.3d 120">id.</a> </em>at 6 n.l. But that is a logical fallacy. While a single word written on a piece of paper can certainly constitute a public record, that does not mean that each word contained within a public record is a <em>separate </em>
      <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>public record. Every square may be a rectangle, but every rectangle is not a square. Similarly, while a single piece of paper can constitute a public record, it does not mean that every page contained within a public record is a separate public record. I would reject that reasoning and hold that when an entire public record is improperly withheld, it cannot be subdivided into pages for the purpose of imposing a separate penalty per page. I would reverse and remand for imposition of a penalty per record or per group of records, at the discretion of the superior court, pursuant to the statute and our precedent.</p>

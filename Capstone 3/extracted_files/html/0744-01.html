Dog owners are usually strictly liable for dog bite damages. RCW 16.08.040. In other words, if strict liability applies, the injured person does not have to prove that the owner was negligent or aware that the dog posed a threat. If strict liability applies in this case, it appears the only issue for the jury would be the amount of damages.

After surveying the scene, Finch requested a “K-9” unit to help search the brewery. Deputy Rod Ditrich of the Thurston County Sheriff’s Office responded with his police dog, Rex.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The building was dark inside except for the officers’ flashlights. Finch, Ditrich, and Rex entered the building, and Ditrich loudly announced their presence. When no one responded, Ditrich commanded Rex to search the building. Rex, unleashed, ran ahead of the officers, tracking the scent of the suspect in and out of rooms.</p>

This reading, however, does not take into account the myriad of situations police dogs are trained for, including training to bite in certain circumstances without a direct order. For example, police dogs are trained in “[m] aster protection”—to protect their handlers in the event that the handler is attacked or injured—and will bite the assailant without a command to do so. WAC 139-05-915(4)(a)(xii), (d); <em>see also </em>CP at 148. But under Finch’s interpretation, municipalities would be strictly liable for any dog bite made without a command.

Here, the legislature has so determined in RCW 16.08.040 by imposing strict liability on dog owners when their dogs bite others, and by further providing a narrow exception to such liability.

As discussed below, the dog bite statute, RCW 16.08.040, imposes strict liability on the owner of any dog, including a police department, when a dog bites any person.

When he arrived at the Providence St. Peter Hospital emergency room in Olympia, a urologist examined his injuries and determined that he should be treated at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. An ambulance transported Officer Finch to Harborview, and the urologist there determined that immediate scrotal surgery was necessary. CP at 283. The surgery revealed that the dog bite had ruptured Officer Finch’s right testicle, requiring removal of one quarter of that damaged organ. Following the surgery, the urologist informed Officer Finch that while the remaining partial testicle could still produce testosterone, it would no longer produce sperm, and that during convalescence if the blood supply to the partial <a id="p757" href="#p757" data-label="757" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*757</a>testicle proved insufficient or the organ was otherwise not viable, it would have to be removed.

As noted, it is undisputed that no one intended for the dog to attack Officer Finch. Thus, the dog acted on its own in attacking Officer Finch. Moreover, it took Deputy Ditrich “at least one minute” to get Rex to release his bite on Officer Finch and the handler ultimately had to physically pull the dog off of Officer Finch and remove him from Officer Finch’s location. CP at 282. Accordingly, it simply cannot be said that the dog was <em>under the control </em>of its handler when it bit Officer Finch. Although the dog and handler were in the same location, and although it was the handler’s <em>responsibility </em>to remain in control of the dog at all times, <em>see </em>WAC 139-05-915(5), such control was clearly not maintained here; otherwise, Officer Finch would not have been attacked. Accordingly, a jury could so find and thereby <a id="p761" href="#p761" data-label="761" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*761</a>determine that the exemption contained in RCW 16.08.040(2) does not apply.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">14</a>

Under the majority’s view, a police dog deployed by its handler with a command to track and apprehend (find, and bite and hold) a fleeing felon, which then tracked through a public park mauling small children along the way, would fall within the exception. I disagree. By its terms, the exemption applies only to a “lawful application.” In the given example, the lawful application is the command to track, bite, and hold the fleeing felony suspect. There is <em>no </em>“application” where the dog strays and engages in aggressive conduct not ordered by the handler. Further, while the dog is attacking the children, the handler is <em>not in control </em>of the dog and, thus, there is no lawful application as to the action in question—the attack on the children. Similarly here, the attack on Officer Finch was beyond the scope of the handler’s directive and the handler was not in control of Rex when Rex attacked Officer Finch. Under such circum<a id="p762" href="#p762" data-label="762" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*762</a>stances, a jury could conclude that the exemption does not apply.</p>

The majority notes the specific uses that police dogs may be trained to carry out include patrol and investigation, tracking, searches, and specific substance detection. <em>See id. </em>(citing to WAC 139-05-915(4)).

The evidence the County points to regarding a police dog’s training to protect its handler concerns certification tests for the handler and dog. In such tests, a decoy “assaultfs]” the handler (after approaching and conversing with the handler for a while) in order to test the dog’s protective response. CP at 148.

On that basis, the police dog here was not acting in accordance with its training.

Deputy Ditrich’s “K-9 Usage Report” states that when Deputy Ditrich recalled the police dog with the command “ ‘here, here, here,’ ” “Officer Finch quickly came up to me and as he reached my location (just as K9 Rex was returning to me), he saw the suspect... and <a id="p764" href="#p764" data-label="764" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*764</a>began shouting ‘Show me your hands, Show me your hands!’ ” CP at 287. “K9 Rex took someone <em>approaching me from behind rapidly and shouting[ ] </em>as a threat to me and immediately made contact with [i.e., bit] Officer Finch.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>

There, the police dog handler employed his police dog to apprehend a suspect who was attempting to flee. The federal district court held that the RCW 16.08.040(2) exemption applied and dismissed the defendant arrestee’s RCW 16.08.040 strict liability claim against the city of Seattle.

The majority concludes that the police dog here was “lawfully applied” because it “was on duty performing [its] job duties under the control of a dog handler.” <em>Id. </em>at 753. But, as discussed, while the dog was indeed on duty, the undirected biting of another officer is not one of the dog’s job duties, and whether the dog was under the handler’s control at the time of the bite is disputed. Notably, the majority acknowledges that a police dog being “ ‘under the control of a dog handler’ ” is one of the prerequisites for application of the exemption. <em>Id. </em>at 749 (quoting RCW 4.24.410(1)(a)). But the majority merely assumes that this requirement is met, repeating throughout the opinion that the dog was “under the control of a dog handler,” while ignoring that this is a disputed factual issue. <em>See id. </em>at 747, 748, 753.

He alleged that the value of the mule was $200. It was alleged that the mule was negligently killed by being struck by one of defendant’s freight trains, and that payment had been demanded and refused. Defendant answered, denying that appellee owned the mule, and denying all allegations with reference to killing the mule, and its value.</p>

The mule was found about two miles from where appellee lived. The mule was' struck inside of the railroad fence, and the signs showed that the mule was knocked toward the south, and the track at this point was not straight; that it was night when he found his mule, but that he went back the nest day and made an examination and he could see where the mule had run down the track.

It was worth what he paid for it, and it weighed 1,100 pounds. It was three years old when he bought it, and he had had it about three years. Appellee also testified that he had inquired about the value of mules, and mules like the one killed sold generally for about $200. The mule got out because the gate was left open. He did not see the mule killed. There was a deep <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>'Cut at the place where the mule was killed. The cut was shoulder deep. He saw the mule’s tracks ten or fifteen yards from the crossing, running down by the end of the ties. There was a hole knocked on the mule’s, right hip, and one behind the shoulder. He based his idea of how the mule was struck by the tracks. The tracks were between the ties and the rail.</p>

The tracks were along the end of the ties, and between the ties in the corner, and the mule jumped the cattle guard, and the train struck him and threw him into a post and bent the post; saw the mule after it was killed, and it was hit on the right side, four ribs broken, a hole punched in behind the right shoulder, and also a hole somewhere around the root of his tail. Witness lived about 75 yards from the crossing. The cut there varies from eight to fifteen feet; saw the mule’s tracks 75 yards from the crossing, and could see the tracks between the ties.</p>

He was not positive about the train sounding a warning for the crossing, but there was no stock-alarm whistle.</p>

He was fireman on the freight train when the mule was killed at Wyandotte Crossing; saw»the accident; train was running 35 miles an hour. There was a crossing whistle sounded; the cut was 200 yards from the crossing, and was between 70 and 90 feet wide; saw two mules as the freight train came along that day. The mules were in the right-of-way, about 100 yards north of the cattle guard. The right-of-way fence is about 30 feet from the track. When he saw the mules, there was no danger of their being hurt by the train, and the front end of the train did not hit the mule. The mule was struck by the 7th or 8th car behind the engine. Witness was looking back and saw it happen; was looking back because the mules were running, and they ran about 100 yards before getting to the cattle guard; they started running when the front end of the engine passed them. There was nothing witness could have done to have prevented the accident. The mule attempted to jump between the cattle guard apron and the crossing when he was struck by one of the box cars. Witness saw the mule 100 yards from the crossing, and about 25 feet from the fence. He saw the mule one-fourth of a mile away. He saw two mules, and the other one stayed up on the dump. There was nothing projecting out from the cars. There was no stock alarm sounded, but the whistle for the crossing was sounded.</p>

Of course, it was impossible for the mule to have run along beside the track and make his tracks between the ties as testified by appel-lee’s witnesses.</p>

The jury had a right to believe the „ testimony of appellee’s witnesses, and to believe that the mule was running in front of the train. No one testified about seeing the mule at the time it was injured but the fireman. Whether the testimony of appellee’s witnesses or appellant’s witness is true is a question of fact to he determined by the jury. Where the evidence is in conflict, the finding of fact by the jury is conclusive here, although we might believe that it was against the preponderance of the evidence.</p>

The rule invoked by appellant is well established, but we have already called attention to the fact that the testimony of the fireman is contradicted, and that circumstances are shown from which an inference against the fact testified to by the fireman can be drawn.

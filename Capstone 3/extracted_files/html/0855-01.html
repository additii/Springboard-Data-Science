The appellant deraigns title through the will of her grandmother, Sallie J. Mason, devising the lands to appellant and. appellant’s sister, Eva Moore, and a deed from Eva Moore to appellant. The appellant alleged that, about 28 years ago, her grandmother and Ed Roddy, then owner of the lands claimed by the appellees, entered into an oral agreement by which a boundary line was established between their lands, as described in the complaint and answer, running from a stake driven at the northeast corner of the northwest quarter of the southwest quarter of section 30, township 7 north, range 3 west, running west to an old fence-row separating the lands of Sallie J. Mason and Ed Roddy; that the fence which appellees alleged to be oh their lands runs south of the boundary line as above established,. and is on appellant’s land.

There was testimony tending to prove that a certain fence, designated by witnesses and marked on certain maps and plats in evidence as “new fence,” was on the land in controversy claimed by the appellees. The court refused to permit the offered testimony of Mrs. Wilkes to be introduced, to which ruling the appellant duly excepted.</p>

This testimony should have been admitted and considered by the-jury in connection with the agreement of counsel and all the other testimony adduced in evidence. The agreement of counsel, to-wit: “That the deeds mentioned in the pleadings may be treated as in evidence, and that each party is the owner of respective lands mentioned in the pleadings, and that the question is whether or not the fence is on the land of the plaintiffs or on the land of the defendant,” should be interpreted in connection with the pleadings and all the other evidence in the cause. When this is done, it is obvious that the parties meant by the “agreement of counsel” to treat the deeds, mentioned in the pleadings of the respective parties, as muniments of their title to the lands described therein, about which there was no controversy; that the only question was whether the “new fence,” referred to by the witnesses and marked on the plats in evidence as the “new fence line now being erected,” was on the land of the plaintiffs or the land of the defendant, as claimed by them in their respective pleadings. In other words, the- issue between the parties, as shown by the pleadings, was the title and right of possession to a parcel of land of three and one-half acres, situated on <a id="p859" href="#p859" data-label="859" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*859</a>the boundary line of the adjoining owners, appellees and appellant.</p>

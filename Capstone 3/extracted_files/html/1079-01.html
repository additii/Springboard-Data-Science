This court has ruled that, in order for an affiant to qualify as a credible person under the statute, he must be cognizant of the prejudice existing throughout the whole county, and not merely in portions thereof. <em>Dewein </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/120/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="120 Ark. 302" data-case-ids="1561092" data-case-paths="/ark/120/0302-01">120 Ark. 302</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=179%20S.W.%20346" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="179 S.W. 346">179 S.

The count in the indictment charging-appellant with embezzlement alleged that he came into possession of $19.50 as agent of the Hall Grocery Company, a corporation, on the 10th day of November, 1928, and unlawfully, feloniously and fraudulently converted same to his own use. The State introduced testimony to prove the alleged unlawful conversion of said amount on <a id="p1081" href="#p1081" data-label="1081" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1081</a>the 10th day of November, 1928, and then introduced other evidence tending to show that other amounts had been converted in a similar manner on other dates before and after the date alleged in the indictment. The proof introduced by the State tended to show that each separate conversion constituted a separate offense, so the only purpose for which similar offenses committed by appellant about the same time could have been introduced was to reflect his intent in converting said sum on the date alleged, and the introduction thereof should have been limited to that purpose, by instruction or otherwise. <em>Strong </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/81/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="81 Ark. 25" data-case-ids="1530637" data-case-paths="/ark/81/0025-01">81 Ark. 25</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20S.W.%20678" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="98 S.W. 678">98 S. W. 678</a>, and cases cited therein. Appellant’s requested instruction No. 2 was a correct declaration of law relative to the purpose for which evidence of similar transactions occurring about the same time might be introduced, and should have been given to the jury. Prejudicial error was committed by the trial court in refusing to give his requested instruction.</p>
    <p id="b1099-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1099.4",1099,[156,1342,1199,656]]]'>Appellant also assigns as reversible error the refusal of the trial court to give his requested instruction No. 6 on the admissibility of the written confession of appellant, and in giving instruction No. 6 on his own motion. We do not think instruction No. 6 given by the court was prejudicial, although perhaps susceptible of a construction not intended. In other words, we do not think the language used misled the jury as to the true meaning of the instruction. The law is more clearly and accurately expressed in instruction No. 6 requested by appellant. On a retrial of the case it should be given instead of instruction No. 6 which was given by the court on its own motion.</p>

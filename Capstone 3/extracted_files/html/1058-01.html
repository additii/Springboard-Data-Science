Acting on this warrant, the sheriff and his deputies, on the 27th of October, 1933, seized some twenty-one slot machines of various kinds.

The law of contempts is well settled in ’this State, and the rules announced by our decisions do not differ from those laid down in the authorities cited by the learned trial judge. Early in the history of this court, it had occasion to discuss at length and determine the powers of the court with relation to the punishment for contempt, to distinguish between true liberty of the press and license, and to make inquiry into and determine the nature and effect of those acts- and declarations deemed to be contempts and the reason therefor. To determine what the law of contempt is, and the power of the courts with respect thereto, we need therefore to look only to our own decisions, and from these Ave derive the following rules: (1) That the.power of punishment for contempt is independent of statutory authority, being inherent in and an immemorial.inci<a id="p1064" href="#p1064" data-label="1064" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1064</a>dent of .judicial power, its conclusions to be reached and judgments found without the intervention of a jury; (2) that, because of this extraordinary and inherent power, the administration of which is entrusted to the conscience of the court alone, the power should never be exercised except in those cases where the necessity is plain and unavoidable if the authority of the courts is to continue; (3) that courts entertain proceedings for contempt for two purposes, one to preserve the power and dignity of the court and to punish for disobedience of orders, and the other to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to suits and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made to enforce the rights and administer the remedies to which the court has found the parties to be entitled.</p>
    <p id="b1082-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1082.4",1082,[315,1119,1206,1078]]]'>It is the first class with which the court has to deal in the instant case. In order to preserve the dignity and efficiency of courts, it is essential, among other things, that no conduct be permitted which is either a direct or a consequential contempt — a direct contempt which openly insults the court or infringes on its power committed in the presence of the presiding judges, or consequential, which, without open insult or direct opposition, plainly tends to create an universal disregard of their authority. In the latter class are included any speaking or writing contemptuously of the court or judges acting in their judicial capacity; or by printing false accounts of causes then pending before the court; or printing articles with respect thereto which would be calculated to influence, intimidate, impede, embarrass or obstruct the courts in the due administration of justice. <em>Neel </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/9/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="9 Ark. 259" data-case-ids="8727277" data-case-paths="/ark/9/0259-01">9 Ark. 259</a>; <em>Cossart </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/citations/?q=14%20Ark.%20541" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="14 Ark. 541">14 Ark. 541</a>; <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em><a href="/ark/16/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="16 Ark. 384" data-case-ids="8725284" data-case-paths="/ark/16/0384-01">16 Ark. 384</a>; Ex parte <em>Winn, </em><a href="/ark/105/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="105 Ark. 190" data-case-ids="1347104" data-case-paths="/ark/105/0190-01">105 Ark. 190</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20S.W.%20399" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="150 S.W. 399">150 S.

The first issue in this case is who has standing to bring those types of challenges. The Court of Appeals created new limits on who can bring such challenges, but we reverse and adhere to our existing standards because they adequately ensure that only those affected by an ordinance may challenge it. Applying those existing standards, we find that petitioners in this case had standing to bring this challenge. The second issue in this case is the substance of the petitioners’ challenge: whether the initiative’s subject matter falls within the scope of authority granted to local residents. This initiative attempts to regulate a variety of subjects outside this scope of <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>authority, including administrative matters, water law, and constitutional rights.

This concern has been attributed to both “the constitutional preeminence of the right of initiative,” <em>Coppernoll, </em>155 Wn.2d at 297. There are also general concerns that “the courts should not interfere in the electoral and legislative processes, and that the courts should not render advisory opinions.” <em>Seattle Bldg. &amp; Constr.

To address these concerns, we strictly limit the type of preelection challenges courts will review. Courts will not consider a challenge to the substantive validity of a statewide initiative prior to the election. <em>Coppernoll, </em>155 Wn.2d at 297. Courts will generally review only two types of challenges—procedural challenges (such as sufficiency of signatures and ballot titles) and whether the subject matter is proper for direct legislation. <em>Id. </em>at 298-99. As we have explained, this second type of challenge is typically aimed at local initiatives because of the “more limited powers of initiatives under city or county charters.” <em>Id. </em>at 299.

We now clarify that these rules address different concerns and should not be conflated. “ ‘The kernel of the standing doctrine is that one who is not adversely affected by a statute may not question its validity.’ ” <em>Grant County, </em>150 Wn.2d at 802 (quoting <em>Walker, </em>124 Wn.2d at 419). In contrast, our limits on preelection review ensure that we do not address the substantive validity of a statute before it is enacted. Requiring challengers to meet heightened standing requirements does nothing to help the court avoid addressing the substantive validity of a statute before it is enacted, it only limits the groups of people who can challenge initiatives. Therefore, if a case involves one of the few types of allowable preelection initiative challenges, petitioners should have to meet only our traditional standing requirements.</p>

First, petitioners must show that the interest they are seeking to protect is arguably within the zone of interests that the initiative will protect or regulate. As the Court of Appeals noted, one of the petitioners’ strongest arguments regarding this prong relates to the initiative’s provision giving the Spokane River water rights. Two of the petitioners actively use the Spokane River—Spokane County (which maintains a sewage treatment plant on the river) and Avista Corporation (a utility company that, among other things, stores water in Lake Coeur d’Alene that might otherwise flow into the Spokane River). The Court of Appeals found <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>that these would arguably put the petitioners within the zone of interests regulated by the initiative but that this was not sufficient in the context of a preelection challenge. <em>Spokane Entrepreneurial Ctr., </em>No. 31887-7-III, slip op. at 11-12. In light of our holding that petitioners are not subject to heightened standing requirements, we hold that petitioners are certainly within the zone of interests that the initiative protects or regulates. The initiative gives the Spokane River its own water rights, including the rights to sustainable recharge, sufficient flows to support native fish, and clean water. This protects or regulates the water of the Spokane River, which petitioners use pursuant to state and federal law. Similarly, housing builders and developers would be within the zone of interests regulated by the initiative’s provision requiring an additional level of approval from neighborhood residents for all major developments. Petitioners meet the first standing requirement.</p>
    <p id="b160-3" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[199,1297,1249,925]]]'>¶17 Second, petitioners must show injury in fact, economic or otherwise. If we were to require that a petitioner show that an injury had already occurred, no challenger could ever meet this requirement for an initiative that had not yet been enacted. However, we have not required challengers to local initiatives to show that an injury has already occurred. Instead, we have allowed petitioners to show that they would suffer an injury in fact if the law were to pass. For example, in <em>Grant County, </em>we held that property owners “clearly” met the “actual injury” standing requirement because they “face different tax rates following annexation.” 150 Wn.2d at 802-03. Similarly, in <em>Mukilteo Citizens for Simple Government v. City of Mukilteo, </em><a href="/wash-2d/174/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="174 Wash. 2d 41" data-case-ids="4021856" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/174/0041-01">174 Wn.2d 41</a>, 46, <a href="/citations/?q=272%20P.3d%20227" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="272 P.3d 227">272 P.3d 227</a> (2012), we found that an association of city residents had standing to challenge a proposed initiative because the individual members had standing as “Mukilteo residents who are eligible to vote.”</p>

The clearest examples arise from the provisions <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>of the initiative that (1) assign water rights that conflict with water rights held pursuant to state law and (2) create a new zoning approval process. Petitioners include a utility company and a county entity that use the Spokane River pursuant to existing state law that would certainly suffer harm if others were given conflicting water rights related to the Spokane River. Similarly, the petitioner builders and developers would suffer harm by having to go through an additional zoning approval process. Regardless of whether these harms might be justified or offset by other societal benefits, these petitioners will suffer harm.

First, “administrative matters, particularly local administrative matters, are not subject to initiative or referendum.” <em>Our Water-Our Choice!, </em>170 Wn.2d at 8. “Generally speaking, a local government action is administrative if it furthers (or hinders) a plan the local government or some power superior to it has previously adopted.” <em>Id. </em>at 10. We have noted that “[d]iscerning whether a proposed initiative is administrative or legislative in nature can be difficult.” <em>Id. </em>In one case, we described the question as “whether the proposition is <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>one to make new law or declare a new policy, or merely to carry out and execute law or policy already in existence.” <em>Ruano v. Spellman, </em><a href="/wash-2d/81/0820-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="81 Wash. 2d 820" data-case-ids="1064061" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/81/0820-01">81 Wn.2d 820</a>, 823, <a href="/citations/?q=505%20P.2d%20447" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="505 P.2d 447">505 P.2d 447</a> (1973).</p>
    <p id="b162-3" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[201,518,1253,367]]]'>¶21 Similarly, a local initiative “is beyond the scope of the initiative power if the initiative involves powers granted by the legislature to the governing body of a city, rather than the city itself.” <em>City of Sequim v. Malkasian, </em><a href="/wash-2d/157/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="157 Wash. 2d 251" data-case-ids="3004542" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/157/0251-01">157 Wn.2d 251</a>, 261, <a href="/citations/?q=138%20P.3d%20943" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="138 P.3d 943">138 P.3d 943</a> (2006). As this court has explained, a grant of authority to the city’s legislative body means the city council or mayor, not the electorate. <em>Id. </em>at 265.</p>
    <p id="b162-4" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[199,908,1249,629]]]'>¶22 Finally, the provisions of a local initiative must be within the scope of the authority of the city itself. As we have explained, “While the inhabitants of a municipality may enact legislation governing local affairs, they cannot enact legislation which conflicts with state law.” <em>Seattle Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council, </em>94 Wn.2d at 747. In that case, we reviewed a Seattle initiative that would have halted certain Interstate 90 construction projects. <em>Id. </em>at 742. We struck down the initiative—prior to it being put on the ballot—holding that it dealt with matters that the city had no authority to regulate: “the location and construction of state limited access facilities.” <em>Id. </em>at 749.</p>
    <p id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.6",162,[202,1568,1246,151]]]'>¶23 The trial court found that all four of the Envision Initiative provisions were outside the scope of the initiative power. We discuss each provision in turn.</p>
    <p id="b162-6" data-blocks='[["BL_162.7",162,[201,1741,1248,630]]]'>¶24 The first provision would require any proposed zoning changes involving large developments to be approved by voters in the neighborhood. The trial court ruled that this provision dealt with administrative matters and was thus outside the scope of the initiative power. We affirm this ruling. The city of Spokane has already adopted processes for zoning and development. This provision would modify those processes for zoning and development decisions, which falls under our description of an administrative matter since it deals with carrying out and executing laws or policies already in existence. <em>See Ruano, </em>81 Wn.2d at 823.</p>
    <p id="b163-2" data-blocks='[["BL_163.3",163,[201,345,1247,980]]]'>
      <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>¶25 The second provision would give the Spokane River the legal right to “exist and flourish,” including the rights to sustainable recharge, sufficient flows to support native fish, and clean water. CP at 40. It would also give Spokane residents the right to access and use water in the city, as well as the right to enforce the Spokane River’s new rights. <em>Id. </em>The trial court ruled that this provision was outside of the scope of the local initiative power because it conflicted with state law, which already determines the water rights for the Spokane River. The trial court noted that this provision was particularly problematic because it dealt with an aquifer that is actually located in Idaho, which is outside of the city’s authority. The trial court also ruled that this provision was administrative in nature because it would deal with how an existing regulatory scheme is implemented. We affirm. This broad provision is directly contrary to the water rights system established by the State and is outside the scope of the city’s authority.</p>
    <p id="b163-3" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[201,1349,1248,688]]]'>¶26 The third provision attempts to give employees the protections of the Bill of Rights against their employer in the workplace. The trial court ruled that this provision was outside of the scope of the local initiative power because (1) municipalities cannot expand constitutional protections and (2) this provision would conflict with state and federal labor laws. We affirm. Expanding the Bill of Rights to apply to private persons and entities, not just state actors, is a federal constitutional issue that is outside the scope of local authority. <em>See Ford v. Logan, </em><a href="/wash-2d/79/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="79 Wash. 2d 147" data-case-ids="1070573" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/79/0147-01">79 Wn.2d 147</a>, 156, <a href="/citations/?q=483%20P.2d%201247" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="483 P.2d 1247">483 P.2d 1247</a> (1971) (“Amendment of our constitution is not a legislative act and thus is not within the initiative power reserved to the voters.”).</p>
    <p id="b163-4" data-blocks='[["BL_163.5",163,[199,2066,1249,313]],["BL_164.1",164,[202,345,1252,360]]]'>¶27 The fourth provision would strip the legal rights of any corporation that violated the rights secured in the charter. This appears to be a response to the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, </em><a href="/us/558/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="558 U.S. 310" data-case-ids="3639027" data-case-paths="/us/558/0310-01">558 U.S. 310</a>, 342-43, <a href="/us/558/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="558 U.S. 310" data-case-ids="3639027" data-case-paths="/us/558/0310-01">130 S.

The trial court ruled that this provision was outside of the scope of the local initiative power because it directly conflicts with federal and state law. We affirm this ruling because municipalities cannot strip constitutional rights from entities and cannot undo decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</p>

    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[201,865,1246,421]]]'>¶28 While preelection challenges to initiatives are disfavored, two types of challenges can be brought prior to election. For those allowable challenges, we continue to apply our existing standing rules. Under those rules, petitioners had standing to challenge this initiative. As to the underlying issue, we hold that the initiative exceeded the scope of local legislative authority and thus should not be put on the ballot.</p>

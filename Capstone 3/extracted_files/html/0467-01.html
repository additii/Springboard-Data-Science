Akers, special chancellor of the Pulaski Chancery Court, and the New Amsterdam Casualty Company, which is a party to the litigation in said court, to inhibit them from proceeding by restraining order or injunction to prevent petitioner herein from prosecuting his suit in the Little Eiver Circuit Court to recover on a $10,000 judgment which he obtained against H. E. Pattison in the circuit court of Saline County. The suit to collect the judgment from the New Amsterdam Casualty Company was based upon a bond executed by it to qualify the Union Indemnity Company to do business in Arkansas, in which latter company H. E. Pattison held an indemnity policy.</p>

E. Pattison and recovered the judgment aforesaid against him on account of the injuries received. He obtained an execution against Pattison out of the circuit court of Saline County, which was returned <em>nulla bona. </em>The Union Indemnity Company, in which Pattison held an indemnity policy, became insolvent. It owned some real estate in Little Eiver County in this State. Subsequent to the insolvency of the Union Indemnity Company, the petitioner herein filed an attachment suit against the Union Indemnity Company in the circuit court of Little Eiver County and levied upon the real estate. He made the New Amsterdam Casualty Company a party defendant, alleging its liability for the payment of the judgment under its qualifying bond executed to obtain the right of the Union Indemnity Company to do business in Arkansas. During the pendency of this suit in Little Eiver County, the New Amsterdam Casualty Company was made a defendant in a suit brought by the Independence Indemnity Company in the chancery court of Pulaski County, which company had also executed a qualifying bond to qualify the Union Indemnity Com<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>pany to do business in Arkansas. Tbe New Amsterdam Casualty Company filed an answer and cross-oomplaint in tbe suit of the Independence Casualty Company; in which it made the petitioner herein a cross-defendant along with others, in which it pleaded that the petitioner herein be required to interplead and file its claim against the New Amsterdam Casualty Company for adjudication in the' Pulaski Chancery Court and that he be enjoined from further prosecution of. his suit at law in the circuit court of Little River County against the New Amsterdam Casualty Company. In the cross-complaint, it admitted the execution of the qualifying bond in the sum of $20,000, but denied any liability thereunder to the petitioner or other cross-defendants, and obtained from Will Gr. Akers, special chancellor, a restraining order commanding your petitioner to refrain from prosecuting his suit at law in the circuit court of Little River County against the New Amsterdam Casualty Company.</p>

The gist of the cross-complaint was to implead the petitioner herein to file and litigate their respective claims against the New Amsterdam Casualty Company under the qualifying bond it executed in behalf of the Union Indemnity Company. It admitted the execution of the bond, but denied any liability to the cross-defendants thereon. The doctrine of the prevention of a multiplicity of suits is invoked to sustain the jurisdiction of the chancery court and to justify the issuance of the restraining order.

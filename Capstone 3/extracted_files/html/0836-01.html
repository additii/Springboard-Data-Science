Prior to trial, Fisher made out-of-court statements that incriminated both herself and Trosclair. After denying both defendants’ motions to sever, the State offered Fisher’s statement at trial as evidence against her. Trosclair challenges the sufficiency of the redactions in protecting his confrontation clause rights under the Sixth Amendment to the federal constitution. Fisher challenges the trial court’s refusal to provide the jury with her requested affirmative defense jury instruction. We hold that the redactions violated Trosclair’s confrontation clause rights, but that the error was harmless. We also hold that the trial court erred in not giving the affirmative defense jury instruction.</p>

Earlier that day, Masten sold cocaine to Trosclair and Mario Steele. Steele lived with his girlfriend, Fisher, who was also Tros-clair’s sister. Trosclair and Steele did not like the quality of Masten’s cocaine, and they decided they would rob Masten to get their money back. Fisher overheard the men discussing the robbery and assumed they might rob Masten later that evening. Fisher then called Masten to set up a second drug deal for Steele and Trosclair. Trosclair and Steele went to Masten’s apartment complex and, after a confrontation, shot him.</p>

The police obtained Trosclair’s cell phone records, which showed he made calls to Masten while near Masten’s apartment. There was also cell phone evidence showing that Fisher placed a three-way call between Trosclair and Masten minutes before Masten was shot. And two eyewitnesses at the scene identified Trosclair as the perpetrator.</p>

Before hearing Fisher’s statement, the jury knew that the codefendants were Fisher and Trosclair. Fisher’s statements implicate three people: Steele, “the first guy,” and a man from California. Steele is referenced by name throughout Fisher’s interview. Steele is obviously not the name of Fisher’s codefendant. Steele is also not the man <a id="p846" href="#p846" data-label="846" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*846</a>from California. The question, then, is whether Fisher’s codefendant is the man from California or “the first guy.” Fisher stated that she had not seen the man from California before the day of the murder and had not seen him since. Most of Fisher’s statements regarding the man from California pertain to the drug deal that had taken place earlier in the day.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> It is unclear whether or not the man from California was involved in the later drug deal that led to the murder. Her statements also reveal that she knows Steele and “the first guy” were already in police custody. Steele and “the first guy” had been arrested, the man from California has not. This eliminates the man from California as her codefendant. The only possible person remaining from the three alleged cocon-spirators who could be “the first guy” was her codefendant, Trosclair. In short, the jury would be able to discern to whom “the first guy” refers “even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

I disagree with the majority that this one did. Nothing in Fisher’s statement “powerfully incriminatfes]” Trosclair as <em>Bruton </em>prohibits. <em>Bruton, </em><a href="/us/391/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="391 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="1767670" data-case-paths="/us/391/0123-01">391 U.S. at 135-36</a>. When read in its entirety, it is difficult to tell who Fisher is referring to when she said “the first guy.” The majority asserts that the redaction “obviously refers to Trosclair” because Fisher stated she knew Steele and “ ‘the first guy’ ” were already in police custody. Majority at 845. All that statement shows, however, is that Fisher was aware that two people had been arrested in connection with this crime. That statement, on its face, does not implicate Trosclair. Fisher later said that there was a third person, the man from California, present at the drug deal with Masten. 14 VTP (Aug. 8, 2012) at 1610. Contrary to the <a id="p855" href="#p855" data-label="855" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*855</a>majority’s view, Fisher never indicated whether she knew if the man from California had been arrested, which means he cannot be eliminated as her codefendant. <em>See </em>majority at 846. Additionally, throughout the rest of Fisher’s statement when she described the men at Steele’s house discussing the robbery, she either referred to Steele by name or referred to the group of men as “they.” <em>See </em>14 VTP (Aug. 8, 2012) at 1616-30, 1637-47. It is unclear from these statements how many men she was referring to, and none of these statements obviously refers to Trosclair, as the majority concludes.</p>
    <p id="b909-4" data-blocks='[["BL_909.4",909,[200,965,1248,798]]]'>¶36 Finally, the majority finds “troubling” that Tros-clair’s first name is used twice in Fisher’s statement, which “makes it more likely that the jury would conclude ‘the first guy’ refers to Trosclair.” Majority at 846. I disagree. By naming Trosclair, the jury may likely conclude “the first guy” must refer to someone other than Trosclair. Why else would Fisher refer to Trosclair by name in some places and not in others? Furthermore, defense counsel for both Fisher and Trosclair jointly moved the court to have the redactions replaced with Trosclair’s first name in those two places. 9 VTP (July 31, 2012) at 1033-35.

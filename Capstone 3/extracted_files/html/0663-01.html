The Casualty Company demurred to the jurisdiction of the court, and, the demurrer being overruled, filed its application for a writ of prohibition in each case, alleging the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court over the subject-matter, and making as a part of its several petitions a copy of the complaints filed in the cases, the original contract entered into between Lynch Bros, and the United States Government, the bond executed by the Casualty Company, and a supplemental agreement later entered into between the Government, Lynch Bros, and the Casualty Company.</p>

At that time the Casualty Company executed a bond as provided by the Federal statute, now § 270, title 40, of the United States Code Annotated, generally designated as the “Hurd Act.” This bond was executed in the penal sum of $15,000, conditioned that the contractors should perform the work as specified, and that they should promptly pay all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract. The contractors began the performance of the contract and continued until July, 1932, when the Government, becoming dissatisfied with the manner in which the contractors were performing the work, exercised the right given it in the contract and notified the contractors that they had failed to exercise proper diligence, and that it would take over the contract, finish the work, charging to the contractors and the surety any excess costs that might be occasioned. The surety thereupon expressed the desire to take over the contract and complete the work. This was acceded to, and a writing was executed designated as a “supplemental agreement.”</p>

Its liability for the payment of all material which had been furnished or work done in the prosecution of the construction before the date of the supplemental agreement was already fixed and the payment guaranteed up to an amount specified in the bond. The argument advanced as a reason for the extension of the liability of the casualty company to the effect that it received a valuable consideration for entering into the supplemental agreement in that it received some six or eight thousand dollars already earned by Lynch Bros, is without merit, as it is apparent under the terms of the agreement that - whatever sums it received, earned by the original contractor, were paid to it only for the purpose of being disbursed in payment for material or labor, and any sums earned above the actual cost of the construction were, by the express terms of the agreement, to be paid to the original contractor.</p>

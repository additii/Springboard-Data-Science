The records do not show that the trial judges considered either defendant’s ability to pay before imposing the LFOs. Neither defendant objected at the time. For the first time on appeal, however, both argued that a trial judge must make an individualized inquiry into a defendant’s ability to pay and that the judges’ failure to make this inquiry warranted resentencing.

The legislature did not intend LFO orders to be uniform among cases of similar crimes. Rather, it intended each judge to conduct a case-by-case analysis and arrive at an LFO order appropriate to the individual defendant’s circumstances. Though the statute mandates that a trial judge consider the defendant’s ability to pay and, here, the trial judges erred by failing to consider, this error will not taint sentencing for similar crimes in the future.

In 2008, the Washington State Minority and Justice Commission issued a report that assessed the problems with the LFO system in Washington. Katherine A. Beckett, Alexes M. Harris &amp; Heather Evans, Wash. State Minority &amp; Justice Comm’n, The Assessment and Consequences of Legal Financial Obligations in Washington State (2008) (Wash. State Minority &amp; Justice Comm’n), http:// www.courts.wa.gov/committee/pdf/2008LFO_report.pdf. This conversation remains important to our state and to our court system.</p>
    <p id="b872-5" data-blocks='[["BL_872.6",872,[187,1083,1253,1075]],["BL_873.1",873,[146,343,1255,853]]]'>¶14 As amici<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and the above-referenced reports point out, Washington’s LFO system carries problematic consequences. To begin with, LFOs accrue interest at a rate of 12 percent and may also accumulate collection fees when they are not paid on time. RCW 10.82.090(1); Travis Stearns, <em>Legal Financial Obligations: Fulfilling the Promise of </em>Gideon <em>by Reducing the Burden, </em>11 Seattle J. Soc. Just. 963, 967 (2013). Many defendants cannot afford these high sums and either do not pay at all or contribute a small amount every month. Wash. State Minority &amp; Justice Comm’n, <em>supra, </em>at 21. But on average, a person who pays $25 per month toward their LFOs will owe the State more 10 years after conviction than they did when the LFOs were initially assessed. <em>Id. </em>at 22. Consequently, indigent offenders owe higher LFO sums than their wealthier counterparts because they cannot afford to pay, which allows interest to accumulate and to increase the total amount that they owe. <em>See id. </em>at 21-22. The inability to pay off the LFOs means that courts retain jurisdiction over impoverished offenders long after they are released from prison because the court <a id="p837" href="#p837" data-label="837" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*837</a>maintains jurisdiction until they completely satisfy their LFOs. <em>Id. </em>at 9-11; RCW 9.94A.760(4) (“For an offense committed on or after July 1, 2000, the court shall retain jurisdiction over the offender, for purposes of the offender’s compliance with payment of the legal financial obligations, until the obligation is completely satisfied, regardless of the statutory maximum for the crime.”). The court’s long-term involvement in defendants’ lives inhibits reentry: legal or background checks will show an active record in superior court for individuals who have not fully paid their LFOs. ACLU, <em>supra, </em>at 68-69. This active record can have serious negative consequences on employment, on housing, and on finances. <em>Id. </em>at 69. LFO debt also impacts credit ratings, making it more difficult to find secure housing. Wash. State Minority &amp; Justice Comm’n, <em>supra, </em>at 43. All of these reentry difficulties increase the chances of recidivism. <em>Id. </em>at 68.</p>
    <p id="b873-4" data-blocks='[["BL_873.5",873,[151,1227,1249,370]]]'>¶15 Moreover, the State cannot collect money from defendants who cannot pay, which obviates one of the reasons for courts to impose LFOs. <em>See </em>RCW 9.94A.030. For example, for three-quarters of the cases sentenced in the first two months of 2004, less than 20 percent of LFOs had been paid three years after sentencing. Wash. State Minority &amp; Justice Comm’n, <em>supra, </em>at 20.</p>
    <p id="b873-5" data-blocks='[["BL_873.6",873,[150,1619,1250,422]]]'>¶16 Significant disparities also exist in the administration of LFOs in Washington. For example, drug-related offenses, offenses resulting in trial, Latino defendants, and male defendants all receive disproportionately high LFO penalties. <em>Id. </em>at 28-29. Additionally, counties with smaller populations, higher violent crime rates, and smaller proportions of their budget spent on law and justice assess higher LFO penalties than other Washington counties. <em>Id.</em>

Suppl. Br. of Pet’r (Blazina) at 8. They also argue that the <a id="p838" href="#p838" data-label="838" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*838</a>record must reflect this inquiry. We agree. By statute, “[t]he court <em>shall not </em>order a defendant to pay costs unless the defendant is or will be able to pay them.” RCW 10.01.160(3) (emphasis added). To determine the amount and method for paying the costs, “the court <em>shall </em>take account of the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that payment of costs will impose.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b874-4" data-blocks='[["BL_874.5",874,[194,785,1248,479]]]'>¶18 As a general rule, we treat the word “shall” as presumptively imperative — we presume it creates a duty rather than confers discretion. <em>State v. Bartholomew, </em><a href="/wash-2d/104/0844-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="104 Wash. 2d 844" data-case-ids="1201371" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/104/0844-01">104 Wn.2d 844</a>, 848, <a href="/citations/?q=710%20P.2d%20196" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="710 P.2d 196">710 P.2d 196</a> (1985). Here, the statute follows this general rule. Because the legislature used the word “may” 11 times and the word “shall” 8 times in RCW 10.01.160, we hold that the legislature intended the two words to have different meanings, with “shall” being imperative.</p>
    <p id="b874-5" data-blocks='[["BL_874.6",874,[194,1285,1247,529]]]'>¶19 Practically speaking, this imperative under RCW 10.01.160(3) means that the court must do more than sign a judgment and sentence with boilerplate language stating that it engaged in the required inquiry. The record must reflect that the trial court made an individualized inquiry into the defendant’s current and future ability to pay. Within this inquiry, the court must also consider important factors, as amici suggest, such as incarceration and a defendant’s other debts, including restitution, when determining a defendant’s ability to pay.</p>
    <p id="b874-6" data-blocks='[["BL_874.7",874,[193,1837,1253,529]],["BL_875.1",875,[151,340,1250,316]]]'>¶20 Courts should also look to the comment in court rule GR 34 for guidance. This rule allows a person to obtain a waiver of filing fees and surcharges on the basis of indigent status, and the comment to the rule lists ways that a person may prove indigent status. GR 34. For example, under the rule, courts must find a person indigent if the person establishes that he or she receives assistance from a needs-based, means-tested assistance program, such as Social Security or food stamps. <em><a href="/citations/?q=710%20P.2d%20196" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="710 P.2d 196">Id.</a> </em>(comment listing facts that prove indigent status).

    <p id="b875-6" data-blocks='[["BL_875.6",875,[152,812,1250,479]]]'>¶21 At sentencing, judges ordered Blazina and Paige-Colter to pay LFOs under RCW 10.01.160(3). The records, however, do not show that the trial judges considered either defendant’s ability to pay before imposing the LFOs. The defendants did not object at sentencing. Instead, they raised the issue for the first time on appeal. Although appellate courts will normally decline to hear unpreserved claims of error, we take this occasion to emphasize the trial court’s obligation to consider the defendant’s ability to pay.</p>
    <p id="b875-7" data-blocks='[["BL_875.7",875,[152,1311,1250,585]]]'>¶22 We hold that RCW 10.01.160(3) requires the record to reflect that the sentencing judge make an individualized inquiry into the defendant’s current and future ability to pay before the court imposes LFOs. This inquiry also requires the court to consider important factors, such as incarceration and a defendant’s other debts, including restitution, when determining a defendant’s ability to pay. Because the records in this case do not show that the sentencing judges made this inquiry into either defendant’s ability to pay, we remand the cases to the trial courts for new sentence hearings.</p>

Cashmere’s investments in REMICs and CMOs gave it the right to receive defined income streams from a pool of mortgages, trust deeds, and mortgage-backed securities, held in trust for investors. The ultimate source of cash flow was mortgage payments. However, Cashmere’s investments were not backed by any encumbrance on property, nor did Cashmere have any legal recourse to the underlying trust assets in the event of default. Thus, Cashmere’s investments were not “primarily secured” by mortgages or trust deeds. We affirm the Court of Appeals and deny Cashmere the deduction.</p>

Investors who purchase a pass-through security own a portion of each of the underlying mortgage loans in the pool and are entitled to a pro rata share of principal and interest payments. The mortgages underlying the securities remain largely intact; any division of interest between investors is accomplished through warranties or proportionate ownership of those whole loans. The cash flows from these investments “pass through” from borrowers to investors. Thus, cash flows may vary from month to month depending on the actual payments borrowers make on the mortgages in the pool.</p>

    <p id="b670-4" data-blocks='[["BL_670.5",670,[198,852,1247,260]]]'>¶10 Cashmere Valley Bank operates 11 branch banks in several central Washington cities. Cashmere’s business includes banking, mortgage, insurance, investment, and leasing services. Between 2004 and 2007, Cashmere invested some of its surplus capital in REMICs.</p>
    <p id="b670-5" data-blocks='[["BL_670.6",670,[199,1131,1247,426]]]'>f 11 During discovery, Cashmere identified six REMICs as representative of all of its investments during this tax period: two Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) REMICs, two Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) REMICs, and two private-label REMICs. The underlying loans in the various REMICs were primarily secured by first mortgages or deeds of trust on nontransient residential real properties.</p>
    <p id="b670-6" data-blocks='[["BL_670.7",670,[200,1578,1247,638]]]'>¶12 One exemplar REMIC is the Fannie Mae REMIC Trust 2000-38. The assets held by the Fannie Mae REMIC Trust 2000-38 are not mortgage loans, but MBSs called Fannie Mae MBS and Ginnie Mae (Government National Mortgage Association) certificates. Fannie Mae essentially had rights to a cash flow from purchasing MBSs. It divided the cash flow into tranches and sold interests in the tranches to different investors, including Cashmere. This REMIC offered 16 tranches designated by letters. About one-half of classes were bonds paying fixed interest and several classes had floating interest rates. One class paid principal only, and two classes paid interest only.</p>
    <p id="b670-7" data-blocks='[["BL_670.8",670,[200,2234,1248,151]],["BL_671.1",671,[112,362,1250,597]]]'>f 13 Cashmere purchased a Z class bond in this REMIC, which received a fixed interest rate of 7.00 percent during the time Cashmere owned this investment. Notably, the <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>weighted average coupon, rate for the mortgage loans comprising the pools in the underlying MBSs ranged from 7.25 percent to 9.50 percent. So there was no direct correlation between the interest mortgage borrowers paid and interest Cashmere received. In addition, because the Z class represented an “accrual” bond, interest was not paid to the Z class as it was received. Rather, interest was first paid to two other bond classes with equivalent amounts added to the principal amount of the Z class bond.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Cashmere received principal and interest payments on its investments only after the other bond classes were fully paid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

This REMIC had nine regular classes and an R class. In addition, it offered three private certificates that provided credit enhancement to the offered certificates. As losses came in, these losses were allocated first to the privately held certificates and then up the waterfall, starting with the most junior tranches. In addition, to protect senior tranches from prepayment risks, this REMIC had a “shifting interest” credit enhancement. Thus, if borrowers prepaid their mortgages in the first year, the money would be locked up for a certain period of time to allow senior tranche holders to receive some interest on their investments before being paid off. Cashmere invested in Tranche III-A of this REMIC — a senior tranche with a 7.5 percent fixed interest rate.</p>

    <p id="b678-3" data-blocks='[["BL_678.4",678,[197,587,1247,1027]]]'>f 32 In a 1990 determination, DOR explained why interest earned from investments in REMICs does not qualify for the mortgage tax deduction. <em>See </em>Wash. Dep’t of Revenue, Determination No. 90-288,10 Wash. Tax Dec. 314 (1990). A savings and loan association sought a refund of B&amp;O taxes assessed on interest earned from investments in REMICs. The taxpayer argued that because interest received from investments in pass-through securities is deductible, interest received on REMICs should be too. DOR rejected the deduction, explaining that with pass-through securities, the issuer holds the mortgages in trust for the investor. In the event of individual default, the issuer, as trustee, will foreclose on the property to satisfy the terms of the loan. In other words, the right to foreclose is directly related to homeowner defaults — in the event of default, the trustee can foreclose and the proceeds from foreclosure flow to investors who have a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage. Thus, investments in pass-through securities are “primarily secured by” first mortgages.</p>
    <p id="b678-4" data-blocks='[["BL_678.5",678,[198,1636,1250,738]],["BL_679.1",679,[117,356,1249,543]]]'>¶33 By contrast, with REMICs, a trustee’s default may or may not coincide with an individual homeowner default. So, there may be no right of foreclosure in the event a trustee fails to make a payment. And if a trustee can and does foreclose, proceeds from the sale do not necessarily go to the investors. Foreclosure does not affect the trustee’s obligations vis-a-vis the investor. Indeed, the Washington Mutual REMIC here contains a commonly used form of guaranty: “For any month, if the master servicer receives a payment on a mortgage loan that is less than the full scheduled payment or if no payment is received at all, the master servicer will advance its own funds to cover the shortfall.” “The master servicer will not be required to make advances if it determines that those advances will not be <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>recoverable” in the future. At foreclosure or liquidation, any proceeds will go “first to the servicer to pay back any advances it might have made in the past.” Similarly, agency REMICs, like the Fannie Mae REMIC Trust 2000-38, guarantee payments even if mortgage borrowers default, regardless of whether the issuer expects to recover those payments. Moreover, the assets held in a REMIC trust are often MBSs, not mortgages. So, if the trustee defaults, the investors may require the trustee to sell the MBS, but the investor cannot compel foreclosure of individual properties.</p>
    <p id="b679-4" data-blocks='[["BL_679.4",679,[119,922,1249,690]]]'>¶34 DOR also noted that it has consistently allowed the owners of a qualifying mortgage to claim the deduction in RCW 82.04.4292. But the taxpayer who invests in REMICs does not have any ownership interest in the MBSs placed in trust as collateral, much less any ownership interest in the mortgage themselves. By contrast, a pass-through security represents a beneficial ownership of a fractional undivided interest in a pool of first lien residential mortgage loans. Thus, DOR concluded that while investments in pass-through securities qualify for the tax deduction, investments in REMICs do not. We should defer to DOR’s interpretation because it comports with the plain meaning of the statute.</p>

Indeed, when this provision was first introduced, it mentioned only investments, e.g., “investments primarily secured by first mortgages or trust deeds ....” Substitute H.B. 232, § 2(10), at 3,41st Leg., 2d Ex. Sess. (Wash. 1970).

But, this is not always the case. The underlying mortgages back all of the tranches, and a trustee must balance competing interests between investors of different tranches. Thus, a default in one tranche does not automatically give the holders of that tranche a right to force foreclosure. We hold that if the terms of the trust do not give beneficiaries an investment secured by trust assets, the trustee’s fiduciary obligations do not transform the investment into a secured investment.</p>

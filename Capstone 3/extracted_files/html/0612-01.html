Before the first year of the lease had expired, the lessee was evicted from the premises under a mortgage foreclosure suit brought against the lessor. After the eviction, the lessor, which is the appellee in this appeal, brought suit against the lessee, the appellant herein, to recover the sum of $483.95, the value of certain supplies furnished the lessee by the lessor under the terms of the lease. The answer denied liability, and a counterclaim was filed by the lessee against the lessor for damages for an alleged breach of the lease.</p>

These globes were screwed in the electric light fixtures, and remained there at the'time tbe purchaser under tbe mortgage foreclosure decree took possession of tbe mortgaged premises. In other words, when tbe lessee was evicted under tbe mortgage foreclosure proceedings, tbe electric light globes were left screwed in tbe electric light fixtures and passed into tbe possession of tbe purchaser under tbe foreclosure proceedings.

As we have just seen, tbe lessee was given possession of these globes which were screwed into tbe electric light fixtures at tbe time tbe hotel was turned over to it under tbe lease. Tbe lessee was evicted before its term expired, and the purchaser under tbe mortgage foreclosure proceedings against the lessor acquired possession of these electric light globes at tbe time it took possession of tbe hotel. The lessor was a party to the foreclosure proceedings, and, if these globes were not included within tbe terms of tbe mortgage, it should have looked to tbe purchaser in tbe mortgage foreclosure proceedings, and bad no right to look to tbe lessee for <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>their recovery. If the lessee had been permitted to retain possession of the hotel until its lease expired, then it should have accounted to the lessor for the globes.</p>

      <em>“2. </em>I charge you that, if you find for the defendants on defendants’ counterclaim, then the only damages you would be authorized to assess in defendants’ favor, because of eviction by paramount title, would be the difference between the rent reserved, that is the rent defendants were to pay by the terms of the lease, and the rental value of the property during the period of the lease, if any is proved by a preponderance of the evi-<a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>deuce, together with what special damages for repairs, fixtures and materials furnished by defendants, in order to make their operation of 'said hotel profitable, if any are proved by a preponderance of the evidence on the part of the defendants, and if the rental value of the hotel is not proved' greater than the rent reserved, then you can only assess nominal damages on that issue. By rental value of the hotel, as used in this instruction, does not mean probable profits of said hotel under the lease, but what the evidence shows would be the fair rental value of the hotel for the term of the lease, above the rent defendants were to pay for the hotel.”</p>

Having omitted to submit to the jury the value of the option to renew the lease as a part of the measure of damages suffered by the lessee for its unlawful eviction from the leased premises, it is obvious that the instruction is in conflict with instruction No. 8 on the same subject.

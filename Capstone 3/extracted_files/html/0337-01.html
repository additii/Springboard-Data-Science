The State system designed to safeguard vulnerable children did not save Rafael. His short life was punctuated by severe and continual abuse at the hands of his own mother, Maribel Gomez. During the brief periods of time that he was in his mother’s care, Rafael endured a broken right tibia, bruises, lacerations to his nipples, a broken left femur, an occipital skull fracture, pinched ears, an infected scab injury to the back of his skull, burns on his left hand, burns on his tongue, at least one other skull fracture, an impact injury to his forehead, fractures to both upper arms, and the fatal blow to his head that ended his life at only 25 months.</p>

    <p id="b407-8" data-blocks='[["BL_407.9",407,[163,975,1252,536]]]'>¶6 Gomez gave birth to Rafael on August 7, 2001, in the backseat of her car. He was taken to the hospital, where he tested positive for methamphetamine, cocaine, and other nonprescribed controlled substances as a result of her drug use during pregnancy. Rafael was placed in foster care and was later declared a dependent of the State of Washington. In the 10 months he was in foster care, from August 10, 2001, through June 4, 2002, Rafael did not sustain any significant injuries. At the time he was placed in Gomez’s custody, Rafael was an “easy” baby who could feed himself.</p>
    <p id="b407-9" data-blocks='[["BL_407.10",407,[163,1533,1250,370]]]'>¶7 In September 2002, three months after leaving foster care and returning to his biological family, Rafael was taken to Samaritan Hospital for a fractured right tibia. He also had numerous bruises on his abdomen and back in the shape of a hand print. The following day, the physician’s assistant who put a cast on Rafael’s leg noticed lacerations on both of his nipples.</p>
    <p id="b407-10" data-blocks='[["BL_407.11",407,[160,1926,1251,476]],["BL_408.1",408,[215,369,1248,431]]]'>¶8 In early December 2002, less than three months after his broken tibia, Rafael was taken to Quincy Valley Medical Center for a broken left femur. He was then transferred to Central Washington Hospital, where Gomez falsely reported a history of a normal pregnancy and reported no prior hospitalizations. In addition to the proximal femur fracture, he was diagnosed with an occipital skull fracture, a pinch mark bruise to his ear, an infected scab injury to the occipital bone at the back of the skull, burns on his left <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>hand, and a burn on his tongue. When the X rays were reviewed, an additional skull fracture was noted that was in the early stages of healing. More than one physician had concerns of abuse, and Child Protective Services (CPS) was contacted. One treating physician, Dr. Cook, “had no doubt that Rafael had been physically abused.” Finding of Fact (FF) 2.17. Rafael was returned to his foster family, where he again sustained no serious injuries.</p>
    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[215,823,1249,430]]]'>¶9 Rafael was returned to Gomez three months later on March 21, 2003. Gomez testified that Rafael rolled off the bed and hit his forehead about a week before his death. She testified that she took him to CPS to show the injury to her case worker, Murray Twelves, and his supervisor, Cecelia DeLuna. Mr. Twelves and Ms. DeLuna both testified that Gomez never brought Rafael into CPS to show them his injury.</p>

Gomez testified that she was feeding soup to Rafael when he threw himself backward in a tantrum with a mouth full of soup. According to Gomez, Rafael hit his head on the floor, lost consciousness, and died the next day. Rafael was declared dead on September 10, 2003, at approximately 25 months old. An autopsy was performed one day after his death. The autopsy indicated blunt force injuries of the head to include</p>

The autopsy further revealed bilateral retinal hemorrhages, contusions of the back and upper extremities, and periosteal and epiphysealmetaphyseal injuries of the proximal humeri. The injuries showed variably acute to subacute and chronic features. The features of the skull fractures suggested acute/recent fractures <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>superimposed on an area of previous skull injury. <em>Dr. Ross’ autopsy findings were consistent with non-accidental trauma.

    <p id="b409-5" data-blocks='[["BL_409.6",409,[155,779,1257,490]]]'>¶11 The autopsy revealed multiple skull fractures of varying ages, as well as new injuries that had not been noted while Rafael was alive. These new injuries included breaks to his upper arms. Dr. Feldman testified that this occurred when Rafael’s arms were jerked severely enough to separate the bones at the shoulders. Although Gomez testified that Rafael exhibited self-injurious behaviors, the foster mother, the day care provider, and the case worker all testified that they had never observed such behavior.</p>
    <p id="b409-6" data-blocks='[["BL_409.7",409,[154,1292,1251,429]]]'>¶12 Rafael’s death in Gomez’s presence gave rise to dependency proceedings in 2004 and 2006 to determine the status of the other children of Gomez and Jose Arechiga, Rafael’s father. During the 2004 proceedings, both Gomez and Arechiga argued that Rafael’s injuries resulted from accidents or Rafael’s odd behavior. During the dependency proceedings, Robert Moser, a local defense attorney, represented Arechiga and another attorney represented Gomez.</p>
    <p id="b409-7" data-blocks='[["BL_409.8",409,[153,1744,1251,375]]]'>¶13 Around the time of the 2004 proceedings, the State charged Gomez with manslaughter. Instead of having her attorney at the dependency proceedings defend her against the manslaughter charge, Gomez retained Arechiga’s attorney, Moser. Moser’s experience included trying misdemeanors as a district court deputy prosecutor and practicing criminal and tort law privately.</p>
    <p id="b409-8" data-blocks='[["BL_409.9",409,[152,2143,1250,260]],["BL_410.1",410,[214,371,1250,544]]]'>¶14 When Moser began representing Gomez, he based his investigation of her case on the facts and impressions he gathered from the 2004 proceedings. At the proceedings he heard testimony from friends, neighbors, social workers, and doctors who had seen Rafael while he was alive or after <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>his death and who had reviewed his medical records for CPS. Such testimony led him to believe that Gomez’s argument about accidents and self-injury would not persuade a judge or jury. Moser states, however, that when he learned new information from Gomez concerning this argument, he endeavored to interview new witnesses. Because Gomez speaks Spanish and, as Moser admits, her English skills are “not very good,” App. 4, at 4,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> the two sometimes spoke through a bilingual friend of Gomez’s or a court interpreter.</p>
    <p id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[216,937,1254,484]]]'>¶15 In addition to investigating lay witnesses, Moser sought out expert witnesses to opine on the cause of Rafael’s death. Moser’s theory of the case appears to have been that Rafael’s death was not due to his fall while eating soup the day before his death, but rather a fall he took from a bed and onto his head a few days prior. Moser eventually retained Dr. Janice Ophoven, a forensic pathologist who specializes in diagnosing the cause of child injuries and deaths, to opine on the cause of Rafael’s death.</p>
    <p id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[217,1443,1250,428]]]'>¶16 Dr. Ophoven requested autopsy slides and radiology images from Moser, but Moser did not fulfill her request until around the start of trial. He did, however, write to Dr. Ophoven to provide her with background information, including that Rafael had suffered many injuries that were “suspicious for child abuse.” App. 18, at 2. Dr. Ophoven misunderstood Moser’s letter to mean that CPS had confirmed the history of abuse.</p>
    <p id="b410-6" data-blocks='[["BL_410.6",410,[217,1893,1255,371]],["BL_411.1",411,[165,362,1250,156]]]'>¶17 At trial, Dr. Ophoven testified that Rafael died of aspiration pneumonia (choking) and conceded that Rafael had been abused. Her ultimate conclusion was that the cause of death was undetermined. The trial judge concluded that Rafael died of blunt force trauma and that Gomez caused his death. The trial judge also concluded that the upper arm injury, occipital skull fracture and epidural <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>hemorrhage, bruised/gouged ear injuries, and lacerated nipples were all the result of assaults by Gomez.

From the time the State charged Gomez with manslaughter (May 2004) to the time the State added the charge of homicide by abuse (April 2006), Gomez and Arechiga were not adverse because the only charge was manslaughter and Arechiga was not present when Rafael was fatally injured.

Second, the trial judge found that Arechiga treated Rafael kindly and heard no evidence that Arechiga abused Rafael or harbored ill will toward him.

To support this claim, she relies on her own declaration as well as a declaration from Moser. Both declarations were drafted in May 2010, approximately six years after Moser began representing Gomez. Moser’s declaration indicates that for the most part, he cannot remember whether he was using an interpreter while discussing specific issues with Gomez. Although they did communicate without an interpreter on some occasions, they also used court interpreters or friends of Gomez’s. Moser even retained a court certified interpreter to interpret during three interviews he held with Gomez in jail during her trial. The burden is on Gomez to show that Moser’s use of interpreters was deficient and ultimately prejudiced her at trial. Gomez has not met this burden.</p>

Judge Antosz took this very seriously and questioned Gomez to ensure she had understood all the proceedings. The court also granted another request Gomez made to recuse a different court interpreter who had a potential conflict of interest. These incidents bring to light two key points. First, both Moser and Judge Antosz understood and respected the critical role of interpreters to Gomez’s trial.

Moser also chose to make a limited investigation of CPS workers because he had heard some of them testify at the dependency proceedings and did not think any of them had actually seen Rafael’s allegedly odd behaviors.

Gomez’s complaints about Moser’s preparation of Dr. Ophoven appear to fall into two categories: (a) Moser’s general preparation of Dr. Ophoven for trial and (b) Moser’s alleged failure to prevent Dr. Ophoven from “conceding” abuse at trial. Both are unfounded.</p>

This is based on Dr. Ophoven’s declaration that reads in part, “Given what I understood to be confirmed prior physical abuse resulting in longstanding CPS involvement, I gave the manner of death as ‘undetermined.’ Without the prior abuse, I would have classified the manner of death as ‘natural.’ ” App. 58, at 4. Gomez reads this to mean that Dr. Ophoven would have concluded that the cause of death was natural had she known that abuse was never officially confirmed by CPS.</p>

For example, one paragraph earlier, Dr. Ophoven declared that “[d] espite the history of abuse, this was a relatively straightforward asphyxiation case.” <em>Id. </em>at 3. This <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>indicates that Dr. Ophoven recognizes the history of abuse in this case. Consequently, Gomez’s reading of her previous statement is inconsistent with the record. Instead, the only reasonable interpretation of her statement is this: had the records indicated no prior abuse, she could have testified that the death was natural. However, Dr. Ophoven testified at trial that the medical records <em>did </em>reflect abuse. Dr. Ophoven’s report indicates that she noted abuse based on “[t]his constellation of traumatic injuries” — not the CPS reports. App. 19, at 8. Accordingly, we have no reason to believe that Dr. Ophoven would testify any differently today than she did in 2007. This is especially clear given that her testimony at trial regarding abuse was based almost entirely on her review of the medical records such as histological slides and X rays rather than CPS reports. This confirms that even if Moser was at fault for Dr. Ophoven’s misunderstanding about the history of abuse, Gomez cannot prove prejudice.</p>

However, a thorough review of the trial record does not support such a conclusion. Even if Moser’s preparation of Dr. Ophoven was deficient, Gomez cannot show prejudice. By the time of her testimony, Dr. Ophoven had received all the necessary material, created a full report, and provided adequate medical testimony on behalf of the defendant.</p>

This supposedly led to Dr. Ophoven’s conceding that Rafael was an abused child at trial. Gomez is unable to prove that Moser deficiently prepared Dr. Ophoven for several reasons. Even if Moser failed to correct Dr. Ophoven’s misunderstanding that the history of abuse had been officially confirmed by CPS, it in no way prejudiced Gomez’s defense. Dr. Ophoven’s passing references to abuse were most certainly warranted given the record that she reviewed. These references to abuse were de minimis amid her medical opinions, as well as in light of the testimony of many other witnesses. Most importantly, Gomez errs when she contends that Dr. Ophoven conceded an element of the crime. This assertion is a misstatement of the law. Abuse is not an element of homicide by abuse.</p>
    <p id="b425-6" data-blocks='[["BL_425.6",425,[157,1435,1256,748]]]'>¶58 At trial, Dr. Ophoven testified under oath that she detected a pattern of abuse when she reviewed the records. This testimony could not have prejudiced Gomez given that abuse is not an element of the crime of homicide by abuse. In explaining what she meant by “abuse,” Dr. Ophoven testified that it is “[a] child that’s been hurt by their caregivers in a context of what I would consider to be inappropriate or criminal behavior. But I can’t say who. I just said somebody has been hurting the child.” 11 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Mar. 5, 2007) at 2317.

However, <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>she did not testify that she noted a pattern of assaults or torture. Under the homicide by abuse statute, the relevant element of the crime is just that: <em>“a </em>pattern or practice of assault or torture.” RCW 9A.32.055(1). It is indisputable that assault is distinct from abuse under Washington law. <em>See </em>RCW 26.44.020(1) (defining “abuse or neglect”); <em>c.f. </em>RCW 9A.36.011-.041 (defining assault in the first, second, third, and fourth degrees); RCW 9A.36.120-.140 (defining assault of a child in the first, second, and third degrees). The trial judge, sitting as the trier of fact, carefully parsed through the different definitions and applied the correct one. Given that, even if Dr. Ophoven’s testimony could be attributed to some deficiency on counsel’s part, Gomez has not shown a reasonable probability that the result would be different.</p>

The name of this crime — homicide by abuse — is somewhat of a misnomer, as was noted by the trial court. See VRP (Mar. 28, 2007) at 12.

While I agree with the majority on several points, I disagree that counsel’s use of interpreters, investigation of experts, and preparation of the expert for trial provided Maribel Gomez with effective assistance of counsel. Counsel was deficient in this case when he failed to use an interpreter for the majority of his conversations with his non-English-speaking client. Additionally, counsel was deficient when he failed to locate an expert to testify about the cause of the victim’s preexisting injuries when that testimony was essential to the defense. That failure was compounded when counsel did not adequately prepare the expert that he did secure for trial. These deficiencies fell below an objective standard of reasonable performance and prejudiced the defendant in this case. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>

Moser states that he pursued more than five experts in pediatric forensic pathology and epilepsy but was able to retain only Dr. Janice Ophoven — an expert in diagnosing the manner and cause of child injuries and death. When the State brought the additional charge of homicide by abuse, one of the two elements of which is a pattern or practice of assault of a child, Moser informed the court that an adequate defense of Gomez would now require an expert opinion on whether Rafael had been abused. Yet, Moser never had Dr. Ophoven opine on whether Rafael’s previous injuries resulted from abuse, accident, or some other cause. This decision — or lack thereof — is even more troubling in light of the fact that one expert Moser spoke with during his investigation had led him to believe that Rafael suffered from epilepsy.

Rather, Moser omitted <em>necessary </em>expert opinions for Gomez’s defense and did not pursue a reasonable, alternative explanation for the child’s injuries.

Moser failed to respond to Dr. Ophoven’s requests. Dr. Ophoven says she finally received the slides after the start of trial, while Moser says he received the slides in the fall of 2006 and gave them to Dr. Ophoven about a month before trial. In either case Moser’s failure to furnish the documents is inexplicable, as even he admits. Furthermore, while Moser retained Dr. Ophoven to testify on Rafael’s cause of death but not on his abuse, he gave her grounds to believe that Rafael had been abused and informed her of the homicide by abuse charge without providing her with the elements of the charge. Moser then failed to confirm Dr. Ophoven’s testimony as to abuse because at trial she conceded that Rafael had been abused, and based on that belief, she opined that the cause of death was undeter<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>mined. Dr. Ophoven states that had she known that abuse was a question of fact for trial, she would have opined that the cause of death was natural instead of undetermined. I would hold that Moser’s preparation of Dr. Ophoven for trial was deficient because he negligently kept himself in the dark as to his expert’s testimony, failed to provide his expert with requested information that was readily available, and then presented her flawed testimony at trial.</p>

RCW 9A.32.055(1). Although Moser had Dr. Ophoven opine on the cause of Rafael’s death, he chose not to have her opine on whether Rafael’s injuries were the result of a pattern or practice of assault. Thus, the defense had no expert opinion to rebut the State’s expert’s opinion that Rafael’s injuries were the result of a pattern or practice of assault and, moreover, had no expert opinion to support Gomez’s and Jose Arechiga’s testimony that Rafael’s injuries were accidental or the result of his odd behaviors.</p>

Thus, not only did the defense lack an advantageous medical opinion on Rafael’s injuries, it essentially conceded one element of homicide by abuse and undercut Gomez’s and Arechiga’s testimony. Moreover, the miscommunication damaged the defense’s response to the other element of homicide by abuse because Dr. Ophoven’s belief that Rafael had been abused led her to report the cause of Rafael’s death as undetermined, rather than report the cause as natural as she now states she would have done had she been informed.

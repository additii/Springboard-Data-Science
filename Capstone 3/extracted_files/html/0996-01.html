    <p id="b1015-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1015.6",1015,[166,1407,1207,354]]]'>The chancellor construed act No. 7 to mean that, when any one broker, distributor or wholesale dealer paid to the State a license fee of $250, such broker, distributor or wholesale dealer was thereby authorized, privileged and licensed to establish and maintain wholesale warehouses or separate. and distinct distributing points in any or all the seventy-five counties of the State.</p>

    <p id="b1016-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1016.4",1016,[296,703,1206,910]]]'>The chancellor’s construction of act No. 7 gives full effect to the proviso “that in no event shall said tax exceed $250, for any one broker, distributor or wholesale dealer, ’ ’ and completely ignores all the language preceding and following it. If this proviso were stricken from said act, it would definitely appear that any broker, distributor or wholesale dealer, who sought license thereunder, would be required to pay a fifty dollar license fee in each county in which he might operate. Thus if business were done by such broker, distributor or wholesale dealer in each of the seventy-five counties of the State, a license fee of $3,750 would be required for such privilege. This language, however, is restricted by the proviso which follows it, and which has been heretofore quoted. Following the proviso, but appearing in the same section of the act, is the following language: <em>“</em>The tax shall be due and payable at each place where the business of wholesale dealer * * * is carried on.”</p>

We think the language, “any one broker,” etc., has reference to the situs of the business transacted, instead of the broader meaning attributed thereto by the chancellor.</p>

In other words, it was clearly the intention of the Legislature to assess a license fee for the privilege of wholesaling light wines and beers a tax of $50 per county as a prerequisite to the establishment of a wholesale warehouse for such distribution; and, in the event such warehouse or distributing point operates or serves trade in more than one county, to charge an additional fee of $50 for each county so served up to a maximum of five counties. For instance, if appellee’s Pulaski County warehouse serves five or more counties, the fee on this distributing point should be $250; if it serves or operates in less than five counties, the license fee should be $50 for each county served. License tax fees on appellee’s warehouses and distributing plants located at Hot Springs, Pine Bluff and El Dorado should likewise be determined. For instance, the warehouse at Pine Bluff must, in any event, pay a license fee of $50. This gives the privilege of doing business in Jefferson County only. If products are distributed from this ware<a id="p1000" href="#p1000" data-label="1000" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1000</a>house to five or more counties, the license fee on the Pine Bluff warehouse should be $250. If this warehouse serves only four counties, the license tax fee should be $200. In other words, each separate wholesale warehouse or distributing point for light wines and beers must pay a tax of $50 for each county served up to a maximum of five counties, or a maximum license fee of $250.</p>
    <p id="b1018-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1018.4",1018,[301,707,1203,142]]]'>Appellee’s warehouses at Hot Springs and El Dorado should pay license fees in the same manner as heretofore indicated.</p>
    <p id="b1018-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1018.5",1018,[300,863,1203,546]]]'>The agreed statement of facts filed herein shows that appellee has and maintains four separate and distinct warehouses or distributing points for the distribution of light wines and beers, and that these four warehouses operate in seventeen counties. Prom this agreed statement, we cannot determine the number of counties actually served by the Pulaski County warehouse. Neither can we determine the number of counties served by the Hot Springs, Pine Bluff or El Dorado warehouses. Therefore we are unwilling to undertake to determine the amount now due the State.</p>

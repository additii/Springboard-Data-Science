    <p id="b505-3" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[164,526,1203,698]]]'>The statute, § 6155, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, provides: “In all cases where loss occurs, and the fire, life, health, or accident insurance company liable therefor shall fail to pay the same within the time specified in the policy, after demand made therefor, such company shall be liable to pay the holder of such policy, in addition to the amount of such loss, twelve per cent, damages upon the amount of such loss, together with all reasonable attorney’s fees for the prosecution and collection of said loss; said attorney’s fees to be taxed by the court where the same is heard on original action, by appeal or otherwise, and to be taxed up as a part of the costs therein and collected as other costs are, or may be, by law collected. ’ ’</p>

    <p id="b505-7" data-blocks='[["BL_505.8",505,[163,1598,1203,756]]]'>The penalty and attorneys’ fees are allowed to be recovered under the statute where the fire, life or accident insurance company liable therefor fails to pay after a loss occurs and demand made within the time specified in the policy. No form of policy for fire insurance is specified in our statutes, and, even though the company issuing the policy was not named a fire insurance company, it would be none the less a fire insurance company if it issued policies of fire insurance upon property insuring against loss by fire, etc., and, as such, came within the provision of the statute, without regard to whether it wrote fire insurance exclusively or whether writing fire insurance was its principal business. In other words, if it insures property against loss by fire, it is a fire insurance company within the meaning of said statute.</p>

But this hazard was expressly insured against by a fire insurance company, and the loss having occurred and not having been paid within the time specified in the policy after demand made therefor, the company was liable, of course, to the payment of the penalty and attorneys’ fees prescribed by the statute.</p>

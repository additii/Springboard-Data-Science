Nothing in the plain language of RCW 9.94A.701(9) refers to an exceptional sentence. To apply RCW 9.94A.70K9) to an exceptional sentence would read the phrase “standard range” out of the statute. The court will not interpret a statute in a manner that renders a portion of the statutory language superfluous. <em>See Kilian v.

Prior to the enactment of RCW 9.94A.701(9), we held that a notation on the judgment and sentence explicitly stating that the combination of confinement and community custody would not exceed the statutory maximum satisfied RCW 9.94A-.505(5). <em>In re Pers.

But <em>Broadaway </em>thoroughly examined the issue and has not been overruled. We should endorse its well-reasoned approach.</p>

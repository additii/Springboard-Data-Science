    <p id="b732-5" data-blocks='[["BL_732.4",732,[303,459,1203,764]]]'>Having information that appellant had resumed the making of liquor, the sheriff, with three deputies, went to appellant’s still to arrest him on the afternoon of July 28, 1931. When the officers came to within a hundred yards of the still, they could hear the persons there employed about the still, and the officers separated. The sheriff and one deputy came up to the still on one side, while the other two officers approached the still from the opposite side. The still was in a thicket, through which a branch or small creek ran. A negro man, who apparently was acting as- a lookout, came out of the thicket, and was ordered by the sheriff to halt. This command was repeated, when the negro began to run, and the sheriff shot him, but no other shot was fired by the sheriff, according to the testimony on behalf of the State.</p>

The officers could not see the man who was firing, as he was crouched and concealed in the foliage of the thicket.</p>
    <p id="b732-7" data-blocks='[["BL_732.6",732,[304,1556,1201,547]]]'>Appellant admitted firing the shot which killed the sheriff, but he testified that he did not know that the parties who had come upon him and his associates were officers. He testified that he heard shooting, and saw the negro fall, and, when he looked to see where the shot came from, he saw a stooping man pointing a gun at him through the bushes. The man fired, and the shot from the gun knocked his hat off, whereupon he drew his pistol and commenced firing, and continued to do so until the man fell. He then ran away without knowing that he had shot an officer.</p>

    <p id="b733-5" data-blocks='[["BL_733.4",733,[160,894,1205,1028]]]'>This instruction presents the law as favorably to appellant as he had the right to ask, but it is insisted that it was nullified by another, numbered 17, which was in conflict with it. This instruction reads as follows: “If you find from the evidence in this case, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was engaged in operating a still, and that deceased, as sheriff, went to such still for the purpose of arresting such person or persons as were operating the same, and that, while advancing on such still for such purpose, he was shot and killed by the defendant, at a time when he had not fired on the defendant ; and if you further find from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant intentionally shot and billed the deceased under such circumstances for the purpose of preventing his arrest by the deceased, you will find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. And if you find these things to be true from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, then you are told that it is not necessary that the defendant should have known the particular identity of the deceased at the time.”</p>

The one declares the law applicable to the facts as appellant contends them to be; the other announces the law applicable to the case which the State’s testimony tended to establish. It was appellant’s contention that a murderous assault was made upon him and his associates by persons who did not disclose their identity as officers, and who were not known to be officers, and that appellant <a id="p714" href="#p714" data-label="714" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*714</a>fired the fatal shot to repel this unlawful assault. On the other hand, it was the theory of the State that the negro was shot to prevent him from escaping, and that appellant immediately thereafter commenced firing at a man known by him to be the sheriff, and that his purpose in firing was to prevent an arrest being made.</p>
    <p id="b734-5" data-blocks='[["BL_734.4",734,[308,680,1203,456]]]'>As tending to show that appellant could have seen and did know at whom he was firing, testimony was offered to the effect that an officer stood at the place where the sheriff fell, and another at the place where appellant stood when he fired, and that persons thus placed could have seen and recognized each other. The admission of this testimony is assigned as error, and the case of <em>Vance </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/70/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="70 Ark. 272" data-case-ids="1509538" data-case-paths="/ark/70/0272-01">70 Ark. 272</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20S.W.%2037" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="68 S.W. 37">68 S.

    <p id="b734-6" data-blocks='[["BL_734.5",734,[296,1161,1213,1164]]]'>The facts in the two cases are not similar. In the Vance case one attorney for the 'State, representing the deceased, and another attorney for the State, representing the defendant, gave, under the direction of a State’s witness, “a sort of dramatic representation of the tragedy.” It was there said: “We can very easily see that a defendant might be irreparably injured by having his actions presented in that way before the jury by unfriendly actors not under oath and paid to prosecute him, and if the record fully presented a case of that kind it would certainly be a serious question as to whether it would not call for a reversal and a new trial. But, though the record is a little vague on that point, we conclude from it that the court only permitted the witness to illustrate the relative positions and the distance between the parties at the time of the shooting. We are not certain that it shows more than this, and we cannot therefore say that there was error. We, however, call attention to this point, for it seems to us that there is room enough for all needful display of the dramatic powers of counsel in the regular walks of the profession, and that it is unnecessary, and even unsafe, to go further, and tread more or less on the domain of the witness.”</p>
    <p id="b735-4" data-blocks='[["BL_735.3",735,[156,351,1202,412]]]'>
      <a id="p715" href="#p715" data-label="715" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*715</a>Here the point at issue was whether appellant could have seen the man who shot, and therefore have known who the man was, and that this man was an officer, the sheriff, and well known to appellant as such. To establish this fact, a witness was permitted to testify that, standing where appellant stood when he fired, he could have seen and recognized a man standing where the sheriff fell. We think this testimony was competent.</p>
    <p id="b735-5" data-blocks='[["BL_735.4",735,[158,767,1203,455]]]'>An objection somewhat similar was made to the admission in evidence of a plat showing the location of the scene of the tragedy and of the participants therein. This plat was drawn by one who was not present at the time of the shooting but who had later visited the scene, but,the accuracy of the plat was established by witnesses who were present, and we see no objection to its use in enabling witnesses who were present to better illustrate their testimony.</p>
    <p id="b735-6" data-blocks='[["BL_735.5",735,[161,1230,1201,941]]]'>Testimony was offered over the objection of appellant, to the effect that he stated that he had once been shot by officers who raided a still which he was operating, and that he did not intend for this to happen again, and that, if officers came down upon him again, he would fight it out with them. The witness so testifying stated that appellant had reference to prohibition enforcement officers. In oúr opinion, this testimony was competent. The defense was predicated upon the proposition that appellant did not fire to resist arrest, but to repel an assault, and that he had ¡been fired upon by persons not known by him to be officers. It is true' appellant’s threat was not directed against the sheriff specially, or against any other particular officer. But it was a threat against any and all officers who might attempt to arrest him, and tended to show his intention in firing the fatal shot, and that it was fired pursuant to his intention to resist officers attempting to arrest him.</p>

Khan is not a native English speaker, and his level of English fluency is disputed. It is undisputed that he was not offered an interpreter by the court or by his attorney. Khan contends, among other things, that his trial was unfair and that his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by not securing an interpreter. Khan asks that we vacate his convictions. We find he has not made the requisite showing for such relief. In the alternative, Khan asks for an evidentiary hearing to develop the factual basis <a id="p683" href="#p683" data-label="683" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*683</a>for his claims. We conclude he has made the requisite showing for such a hearing. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals’ order dismissing this personal restraint petition. We remand to that court for entry of an order transferring Khan’s petition to the Snohomish County Superior Court for a reference hearing. That reference hearing should determine whether Khan’s constitutional and/or statutory rights were violated by the lack of an interpreter and whether any such violation caused him the requisite prejudice for collateral relief.</p>

Here, the State suggests, the decision not to obtain an interpreter was a legitimate trial strategy because it served the defense’s theory that Khan’s Americanized stepdaughter fabricated the molestation story in retaliation for Khan’s enforcement of strict cultural norms, apparently on the theory that the jury would have more sympathy if it could contrast Khan’s broken English with the victim’s fluent testimony. We find this argument unavailing. First, nothing about having an interpreter would make the jury less likely to believe Khan was raised with different norms. Second, it deprived Khan of the ability to understand many of the questions he was asked on the stand and likely deprived him of the ability to <a id="p691" href="#p691" data-label="691" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*691</a>understand many other aspects of the trial.

    <p id="b741-4" data-blocks='[["BL_741.4",741,[201,910,1247,1069]]]'>¶35 Khan fails to demonstrate how his counsel’s failure to provide an interpreter prejudiced him or impacted the outcome of his case. He generally asserts that the lack of an interpreter injured his credibility. But Khan does not present any analysis or argument that his credibility would have been significantly improved with an interpreter. Further, it is more likely that his credibility was injured from evidence produced at trial, such as the testimony from Eram Mirza and Sanober Mirza that they both saw Khan standing near R.H. with an erection. This was highly relevant and consistent with R.H.’s allegations of abuse. R.H. and Eram also testified to the negative backlash they received from their cultural and religious community as a result of their decision to testify against a family member. This testimony lent significant credibility to their allegations, as the jury would not likely believe that R.H. and Eram would endure such disapproval if the allegations were false. Khan does not explain how an interpreter would have impacted his credibility in a way that could influence the result of his trial.</p>

As the lead opinion acknowledges, Khan discusses prejudice only at a very “high level of abstraction ... rather than drilling down into how the lack of an interpreter caused him prejudice by demonstrating what specifically he would have done differently had he understood the <a id="p700" href="#p700" data-label="700" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*700</a>proceedings or questions.” Lead opinion at 692. He does not explain what particular aspects of his proceedings he did not understand, nor does he state any other evidence he would have provided had he been aided by an interpreter. Although his allocution at sentencing was strained, Khan does not now indicate that he would have stated anything differently with the assistance of an interpreter. Moreover, the trial transcript reveals that when Khan expressed confusion, questions were rephrased and Khan provided the relevant information. 3 Verbatim Report of Proceedings at 342-43, 349, 355, 382-83, 391, 401-02. In addition, Khan was able to communicate his version of events and clearly deny the allegations against him. <em>See id. </em>at 344-45.</p>

But this is not the purpose of a reference hearing. Khan must at least demonstrate that he has some sort of genuine factual dispute to resolve on the issue; the reference hearing should not be a new forum “to determine whether the petitioner actually has evidence to support his allegations.” Rice, 118 Wn.2d at 886. Khan has failed to demonstrate prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>or even raise a factual dispute on the matter.</p>

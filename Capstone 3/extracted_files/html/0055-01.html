The first degree felony murder charge was predicated on the theory that Davila worked with Davis to rob Allen’s store, but the court dismissed that charge before the jury deliberated, finding that there was insufficient evidence that Davila and Davis knew one another.</p>

After filing a public disclosure request, the defense learned, after the guilty verdict but prior to sentencing, that Olson had been fired in 2011 after receiving poor evaluations for roughly five years. It also learned that the Crime Lab had performed an audit of Olson’s work in 2007, the year that she tested Swab D and Item 24 for Davis’ case, and that this audit had revealed errors in the vast majority of Olson’s cases and had “resulted in ‘Brady letters’ being sent to eleven prosecuting attorneys notifying them of [Olson’s] problems and her faulty results.” CP at 256.</p>

Specifically, it asserted that Heath had conducted the DNA tests in Davila’s case and had also “reviewed all of Ms. Olson’s tests from the Davis case and agreed with all of Ms. Olson’s findings and conclusions.” CP at 261. The State also asserted that when Heath matched Davila’s DNA to the DNA found on the handle of the murder weapon, she did not rely on any of the testing done by Olson. CP at 267.</p>

The State acknowledged that Olson’s performance record “standing alone . . . would cause a great deal of concern.” 4 VRP at 583 (Aug. 1, 2012). But it argued that in light of the fact that Heath retested Swab D and Item 24 and confirmed Olson’s results, there was no reasonable probability that the disclosure of Olson’s performance record and termination would have changed the outcome of Davila’s trial.

Indeed, the court suggested that there would be no need to consult an expert until the defense had investigated the facts surrounding the Crime Lab’s handling of the DNA evidence: “I am willing ... to give you an opportunity to basically demonstrate that you have sufficient evidence . . . [that] this was contaminated or <em>these procedures were not followed </em>and it was likely this was contaminated. ... I would give you the authority to depose ....

He stated that the expert had determined that contamination might have occurred in either of two ways: (1) if “Mr. Davila’s DNA had been at the lab prior to the evidence from this case arriving at the lab” or (2) “cross contamination of evidentiary items.” 4 VRP at 605 (Oct. 19, 2012).

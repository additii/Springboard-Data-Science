Seargeant, husband of appellee, in January, 1917, made application for membership' in the Modern Woodmen of America, and for a benefit certificate. The benefit certificate was issued on January 17, 1917. On August 19, 1930, John C. Seargeant made application for exchange of his benefit certificate for a term certificate expiring at the age of 65. The certificate was issued, and the assessments were $1.45 per month, and 35 cents per month local camp dues. The dues and assessments were not paid in June, 1932, and on July first he was suspended from membership in the company. The appellee was named beneficiary in the certificate, which was for $1,000.</p>

The money order sent to the clerk at Paducah paid for the months of June to November, inclusive. No formal application was made for reinstatement, but the clerk of the camp signed the receipt and mailed it back to the insured. The clerk also wrote him at the time that he would have, to make formal application for reinstatement, and that he, the clerk of the camp, would write to the head clerk to mail application blanks direct to Seargeant.</p>

Seargeant was not only not in sound health, but was critically ill, and in fact died the next day after the money was sent to appellant, and it was received probably a few hours before his death. The undisputed evidence shows that neither appellant nor its agents knew anything about Seargeant’s illness when it received the money and issued the receipt. The undisputed evidence also shows that the clerk of the camp, Avhen he received the money order, wrote to Seargeant that he would have to make formal application for reinstatement, and that the clerk of the local camp did not have the application but would write the head clerk to send the blank applications for reinstatement direct to Seargeant. This was the day before he learned of Seargeant’s death. It is apparent that when Seargeant was at the point of death, the dues were sent to the camp without saying anything about Seargeant’s illness. When the contract provides that a member may be reinstated if in good health, the mere fact of making application for reinstatement without disclosing the illness of the member is itself an implied statement that he is-in good health.</p>

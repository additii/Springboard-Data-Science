    <p id="b448-4" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[287,845,1209,1012]]]'>The trial court was in error in thus construing § 3772' of Crawford <em>&amp; </em>Moses’ Digest, specifying the time in which contests in primary elections must he commenced. Said section provides, in part, that: ‘ ‘ The complaint * * * shall he filed within ten days of the certification complained of, if the complaint is against the certification in one county, and within twenty days if against the certification in more than one county.” The contest in the instant case is against the total vote of the entire district, composed of three counties, and not against the total vote cast in one county. The purport and gist of the complaint was to change the total vote in the entire district so that the contestant might receive a plurality of the entire vote in senatorial district 29, composed of three counties. Under the rule of liberal construction applied to the primary election laws in this State, set out in the case of <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Russell, </em><a href="/ark/136/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="136 Ark. 217" data-case-ids="1569985" data-case-paths="/ark/136/0217-01">136 Ark. 217</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=206%20S.W.%20131" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="206 S.W. 131">206 S. W. 131</a>, the correct interpretation is to allow a contestant for an office in a district composed of more than one county 20 days from the date of certification in which to file his complaint.</p>

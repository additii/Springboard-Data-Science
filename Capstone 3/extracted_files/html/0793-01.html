First, we are asked to determine whether the Washington Consumer Protection Act (CPA), chapter 19.86 RCW, allows a cause of action for a plaintiff residing outside Washington to sue a Washington corporate defendant for allegedly deceptive acts. Second, we are asked to determine whether the CPA supports a cause of action for an out-of-state plaintiff to sue an out-of-state defendant for the allegedly deceptive acts of its in-state agent. The United States District Court noted an absence of Washington case law providing guidance on these issues. We answer both certified questions in the affirmative.</p>

    <p id="b838-4" data-blocks='[["BL_838.8",838,[201,1221,1247,593]]]'>¶2 Plaintiff in this putative class action is a Texas resident. Plaintiff alleges she received deceptive debt collection letters from defendant Seattle Service Bureau Inc. (SSB), a corporation with its principal place of business in Washington, pursuant to the referral of unliquidated sub-rogation claims to SSB by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, a corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois. Plaintiff alleges these letters constitute CPA violations by both SSB and State Farm as its principal. Plaintiff asserts she incurred damages caused by the alleged deceptive acts.</p>

Plaintiff’s son was involved in a motor vehicle collision in San Antonio, Texas, with a motorist insured by State Farm. As a result of the accident, State Farm paid for damages or repairs to the State Farm insured vehicle. State Farm attempted to pursue an unliquidated claim based on a subrogated interest from its insured in the amount of $9,126.18. Plaintiff received three letters about this claim at her home in San Antonio. According to plaintiff, these letters were deceptive because they suggested <a id="p797" href="#p797" data-label="797" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*797</a>that the sum was the “balance due” on a “debt” rather than “a potential, unliquidated claim based on a subrogated interest from its insured.” Class Action Compl. at 4, 5. Plaintiff became concerned about her credit rating and enrolled in a credit monitoring program. Plaintiff also sought and retained counsel in regard to this matter.</p>

Plaintiff also made a claim for unjust enrichment. Plaintiff named two defendants: SSB and State Farm. SSB is a Washington corporation with its headquarters located in Bothell, Washington. State Farm is an Illinois corporation.</p>
    <p id="b839-4" data-blocks='[["BL_839.5",839,[201,1067,1253,521]]]'>¶5 State Farm removed the class action complaint to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. In the United States District Court, State Farm and SSB filed motions to dismiss and motions to strike plaintiff’s class action complaint, claiming the CPA does not apply to claims made by a plaintiff who is not a Washington citizen. The United States District Court dismissed plaintiff’s claims for unjust enrichment, and certified two questions to this court. No decision has been made on class certification.</p>

The parties spend a great deal of time discussing choice of law principles as well as concerns surrounding due process and federalism. Although the briefing contains discussion about these issues, the certified questions focus on the interpretation of the statute. Additionally, for purposes of the certified question, the district court has not determined whether an agency relationship is established, which requires an analysis under the <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>(Am. Law. Inst. 1958). We are not tasked with such an endeavor. While choice of laws, agency, and federalism concerns along with other issues may all be live questions that the district court will have to resolve, they play no role in our statutory interpretation.</p>

Safeco Title Insurance Co., </em><a href="/wash-2d/105/0778-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="105 Wash. 2d 778" data-case-ids="1199153" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/105/0778-01">105 Wn.2d 778</a>, 785, <a href="/citations/?q=719%20P.2d%20531" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="719 P.2d 531">719 P.2d 531</a> (1986), this court held that in order to prove a CPA violation, an actual deception is not required, only that the act or practice “had the <em>capacity </em>to deceive a substantial portion of the public.”</p>
    <p id="b844-4" data-blocks='[["BL_844.5",844,[202,971,1254,692]]]'>¶18 While elements of other claims involving deception or unfair acts typically include reliance, in <em>Indoor Billboard </em>this court rejected the principle that reliance is necessarily an element of plaintiff’s CPA claim. <em>Indoor Billboard/Wash., Inc. v. Integra Telecom of Wash., Inc., </em><a href="/wash-2d/162/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="162 Wash. 2d 59" data-case-ids="3696450" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/162/0059-01">162 Wn.2d 59</a>, 82, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20P.3d%2010" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="170 P.3d 10">170 P.3d 10</a> (2007). Similarly, in <em>Panag, </em>we rejected the argument that the CPA applies only to consumer or business transaction disputes and that only a consumer or someone in a business relationship with the defendant can bring a private CPA claim. <em>Panag v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Wash., </em><a href="/wash-2d/166/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="166 Wash. 2d 27" data-case-ids="4001497" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/166/0027-01">166 Wn.2d 27</a>, 38, <a href="/citations/?q=204%20P.3d%20885" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="204 P.3d 885">204 P.3d 885</a> (2009). An expansive interpretation of the CPA’s extraterritorial reach in the present case is therefore consistent with our prior cases.</p>
    <p id="b844-5" data-blocks='[["BL_844.6",844,[201,1687,1255,684]],["BL_845.1",845,[201,345,1248,815]]]'>¶19 Defendants rely on <em>In re Bankruptcy Petition of Wieber, </em><a href="/wash-2d/182/0919-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="182 Wash. 2d 919" data-case-ids="4075855" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/182/0919-01">182 Wn.2d 919</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=347%20P.3d%2041" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="347 P.3d 41">347 P.3d 41</a> (2015), which does not compel a different interpretation. In <em>Wieber, </em>the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Washington certified questions to this court as to whether Washington’s homestead exemption law, chapter 6.13 RCW, applied extraterritorially to real property in other states. Ultimately, we concluded that the statute did not allow extraterritorial application where the legislature did not expressly provide for it. In the analysis, we concluded that while there were no specific geographical limitations to the homestead statute, the relevant provisions must be read in the context of the entire statute. Because the statute <a id="p803" href="#p803" data-label="803" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*803</a>includes a variety of procedures that would require action by courts and agencies, we concluded that allowing extraterritorial application of the homestead exemption law would “require the same actions be taken by out-of-state courts and agencies.” <em>Wieber, </em>182 Wn.2d at 927. We concluded that this would be unlikely to be the intent of the legislature, given that the “State lacks the authority to direct actions and procedures of foreign courts or foreign agencies.” <em>Wieber, </em>182 Wn.2d at 927. Our holding in <em>Wieber </em>does not help the defendants here. The procedures in the homestead exemption law “plainly apply only to courts and agencies in Washington.” <em>Wieber, </em>182 Wn.2d at 926-27. No similar concerns exist under the CPA, and the legislative purpose and provisions of the CPA contemplate extraterritorial application, as described above.</p>
    <p id="b845-3" data-blocks='[["BL_845.4",845,[201,1185,1248,429]]]'>¶20 The CPA does allow claims for an out-of-state plaintiff against all persons who engage in unfair or deceptive acts that directly or indirectly affect the people of Washington. The geographic limitations that defendants urge this court to adopt defeat the CPA’s twin purposes of protecting the public and fostering fair and honest competition, and are not supported by the language of the statute. Therefore, we answer question one in the affirmative.</p>

The “fact” that the principal in this case is an out-of-state entity does not change this. A principal cannot send agents into a state to commit CPA violations in order to avoid liability by virtue of its out-of-state residence. The federal court must still determine the agency relationship involved here. Based on the facts, procedural posture, and certified questions, we do not know enough specifics to answer question two except generally. For purposes of answering the certified question—based on the limited facts specific to the <a id="p804" href="#p804" data-label="804" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*804</a>legal nature of the agency relationship—we answer in the affirmative.</p>

    <p id="b846-4" data-blocks='[["BL_846.5",846,[202,595,1246,313]]]'>¶22 We answer both questions yes. Under the CPA, an out-of-state plaintiff may bring a claim against a Washington corporate defendant for allegedly deceptive acts. Similarly, an out-of-state plaintiff may bring a CPA claim against an out-of-state defendant for the allegedly deceptive acts of its in-state agent.</p>

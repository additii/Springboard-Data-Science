The rale there stated is that a common carrier of passengers is not responsible for those sudden jolts or jerks which are the ordinary incidents of travel upon electric cars, and that starting a street car when a passenger is in the act of leaving is not negligence if the passenger is within the body of the car. In other words, the Massachusetts rule supports the contention of the appellant. The case however, relied on as laying down the rule, <em>Gollis </em>v. <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. Co., </em>supra, was by a divided court, the court stating: “In the opinion of a majority of the court there was no evidence to warrant a finding for the plaintiff.”</p>

The rule here is, as stated in <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Ft.

It is not necessary to allege anything else, and the appellant in this case treated the allegations of the complaint as sufficient, without alleging that the jerk was unnecessary. Moreover, the appellee would not know, and probably could not prove, whether the sudden and violent jerk was necessary or not, and the appellant might operate a car, in order to start which it would be necessary to start it with such a violent jerk as to injure the passengers, but <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>under the rule in this State, the question is whether the carrier was guilty of negligence which caused the injury to the appellee, while she was herself in the exercise of ordinary care.

The instruction was to the effect that it was the duty to exercise for the safety of the passenger the highest degree of skill and care which may reasonably be expected of intelligent and prudent persons employed in the operation of street cars for the purpose of carrying passengers in view of the instrumentalities employed and the dangers naturally to be apprehended.

It appears that Powell made a statement in which he said he was interested in the result of the lawsuit; that he was to get half the lawyer’s fees, and that he did not go to Biddle Shops in French’s car, and did not collect $5 from Willis Smith. Powell <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>contends that he was drunk when he made the statement.

But the statement that he was to get half of the lawyer’s fees, together with the statement that he wanted to settle the case for $1,000, so that he could get $250, is not supported by the evidence. The evidence is overwhelming that his statement, which it is alleged he made, that there was a frameup, and that he was to get half the lawyer’s fee, is untrue. He admitted in his evidence on the motion for new trial, that he did not go to Biddle Shops in French’s car, and that Willis Smith was not the Smith that he collected the $5 from, but he insisted that he did collect $5 from another Smith, who worked at the Biddle Shops. He explained his statement about going in French’s car by saying that at the time he testified it did not occur to him that it was material, and he had ridden in French’s car many times. But, as a matter of truth, on the night of the accident, he was in a different car, a car belonging to the woman with whom he was driving, and he declined to say who the woman was.</p>

But a case where a showing made requires a new trial is unusual, and applications for new trials for this cause are not favored, especially where the alleged newly-discovered evidence consists largely of conclusions and hearsay. To warrant a new trial, it must appear that evidence'is in fact newly-discovered, and not merely the importance of it; and a new trial will be denied if the court is not satisfied that the alleged newly-discovered evidence really exists. A new trial for newly-discovered evidence will be granted only where manifest injustice and wrong appear, and there is no other relief obtainable; in determining whether a new trial shall be granted on the ground of newly-discovered evidence, courts, while keeping within well established legal limits, endeavor to do what the interest of truth and justice requires.” 46 C.

I base my dissent principally upon what I conceive to be error committed in overruling the appellant’s objection to appellee’s instruction No. 4 and in giving said instruction. That instruction, after telling the jury that it was the duty of the appellant to exercise for the safety of the passenger the highest degree of skill and care, continuing, was couched in the following language: “Therefore, if you find from the preponderance of the testimony in this case, that the plaintiff was a passenger upon one of the defendant’s cars and, was herself free from fault or negligence, and that she was injured by reason of the failure of the defendant’s operator of the car to exercise for her safety that degree of care above stated, and that the operator, before the plaintiff, after being accepted as a passenger had a reasonable opportunity, in the exercise of usual and ordinary care, to become seated, negligently started the car with such a sudden and violent' jerk as to throw, and did throw her to and upon the floor of the car, and that she was thereby injured, she at the time being free from fault or negligence, upon her part, your verdict should be for the plaintiff.”</p>

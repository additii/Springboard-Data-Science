During the years of the transactions embraced in this lawsuit Ben Eddins was the circuit clerk. During his term practically all the legal notices which came through his office were sent by him to the plaintiffs to be published in their newspaper. In most of the cases Eddins would either take the notices over himself or telephone to the proprietors of the newspaper to send for them. In all cases the notices were published as required by law, and the plaintiffs would then present an account for the amounts due for such publications to Ben Eddins. The plaintiffs charged all the notices which were published to Ben Eddins. They would present a bill to him, and he would look it over and check it. Eddins would then pay the plaintiffs what had been paid in to him as clerk by the various parties interested, and then turn the bill back to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs would present a bill to Eddins every thirty, sixty, or ninety days. Eddins never made any objections to the form of the bill, and, after checking it over, would only pay the items of it which had been collected by him as circuit clerk from the parties in whose interest the legal notices and publications had been made.</p>

The items sued on were never paid by Eddins, and bills were presented to him for payment of them from time to time after Eddins’ term of office had expired.</p>

It is not claimed that the plaintiffs made any express contract with the clerk whereby the latter agreed to become personally liable for the payment of the fees for the legal notices which he sent lo the plaintiffs fór publication. The evidence does show that the clerk sent most of the legal notices which came into his office during his term as circuit clerk to the plaintiffs to be published; but it also is shown that, when the plaintiffs presented <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>their account to him from time to time, the clerk only paid such amounts as he had collected from the parties for whose benefit and in whose interest the legal notices had been published. The plaintiffs knew this fact.</p>
    <p id="b261-5" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[201,589,1223,304]]]'>We are of the opinion that the plaintiffs might recover either upon an express or an implied contract upon the part of the clerk to become personally liable' for the payment of the fees for all the legal notices sent by him to the plaintiffs for publication, where the facts are legally sufficient to establish such liability.</p>
    <p id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[201,906,1208,497]]]'>As we have just seen, there was no attempt to show an express contract to pay the fees for publication on the part of the clerk. Neither is there any charge of negligence on his part in failing to collect the fees. It is only claimed that the facts established an implied contract on the part of the clerk to pay the fees. We think the evidence falls short of proving that fact. As above stated, he is not liable for such fees ¡because, as clerk, he handed the legal notices to the plaintiffs for publication. '</p>
    <p id="b261-7" data-blocks='[["BL_261.6",261,[206,1420,1211,821]]]'>But it is insisted that he is liable because the plaintiffs charged the accounts to him and that he made no objections to this course. Under the circumstances it would appear that this was done simply as a matter of convenience. According to the testimony of the plaintiffs, they submitted the accounts to the clerk at stated intervals, and knew that he was only paying the amounts which he had collected from the parties interested. In all cases where he made no collections he did not pay. Therefore we are of the opinion that the evidence in the record is not legally sufficient to submit to the jury the personal liability of the defendant, Eddins, upon an implied contract. Under the testimony as disclosed by the record he will be only held liable for the amounts collected by him from the various parties which he failed to pay to the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b261-8" data-blocks='[["BL_261.7",261,[211,2251,1205,101]]]'>For the errors indicated the judgment will be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial,</p>

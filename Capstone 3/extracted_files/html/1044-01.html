The annual premium was $64.74, running for twenty years. The policy was issued by appellant to Nieie J. Shivley, wife of the appellee, and the appellee was the beneficiary. The premiums had all been paid, and it was a paid-up policy. The last premium, was April 20, 1929. The insured died on December 26, 1932.</p>

No further payment was made on account of the indebtedness, and appellant alleged that, according to the terms of the loan agreement, the policy had lapsed, and become void on October 23, 1932, and that at the time of insured’s death the policy was not in force.</p>
    <p id="b1063-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1063.4",1063,[214,879,1206,1535]]]'>There were several loans made on the policy, the first one being for $120, and the loan agreement provided that interest on this loan at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum from date to the anniversary of the policy should be paid, and should#be paid annually thereafter on each anniversary of the policy. The agreement further provided that, if interest was not paid on the date when due, it should be added to the principal and bear interest at the same rate. It was further provided in the loan agreement that the sum so advanced shall become due and payable either, (a) if there is default in the payment of any premium on said policy, in which event the sum so due and payable with interest should be deducted in the manner provided in said policy, and said indebtedness thereupon be deemed fully paid. The agreement further provided that, whenever the total indebtedness to the company on said policy, however evidenced, shall equal its cash surrender value, then, in the event of failure to pay interest thereon, said company shall mail to the last known address of the insured, and of the assignee of record at the home office of the company, if any, a notice that the total indebtedness to the company on said policy equals its cash surrender value, and thereupon said policy shall, one month after the mailing of said notice by the company, and without any other or further notice or action of any kind,’be-void and of no effect, unless said defaulted interest shall be paid within said one month after the mailing of' said notice, and whenever said policy so becomes void and of no effect, all of said indebtedness to the company shall be fully paid and satisfied.</p>

      <a id="p1046" href="#p1046" data-label="1046" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1046</a>The policy provided that, when the total indebtedness to the company on said policy should equal its cash surrender value, then, in the event of failure to pay interest thereon, said company shall mail to the last known address of the insured a notice that the total indebtedness to the company equals its cash surrender value, and thereupon said policy shall, one month after mailing said notice, be void. The policy does not require that the insured shall receive the notice, but it does require that the notice be mailed to the last known address of the insured.</p>
    <p id="b1064-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1064.4",1064,[250,918,1204,604]]]'>We think, however, that it was unimportant whether notice was given or not, because, unless the indebtedness equaled the cash surrender value of the policy, there was no forfeiture. The company made several loans on this policy, and, when it would make a*new loan, it would always deduct the amount of the former loan and interest from the amount advanced as a loan on the policy. In all instances, also, where a loan was made, there was a policy loan agreement. The last loan was made on May 21, 1931, and was not due until May 21, 1932, and in April, 1932, the interest of $46.44 was added to the principal, making the total indebtedness $1,086.44.</p>
    <p id="b1064-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1064.5",1064,[251,1529,1203,911]],["BL_1065.1",1065,[230,366,1202,192]]]'>The appellant’s witnesses testify, and the record shows, that the interest for 1932 was added to the loan thereby extended until 1933. There was no promise to pay, and no obligation to pay either principal or interest until May, 1933; but, in order to show that the indebtedness equals the cash surrender value of the policy, appellant calculates the interest accrued, although not due until May, 1933. The only question in this case therefore is whether, in order to declare a forfeiture of the policy, the appellant will be permitted to calculate the interest that is not due, and will not be due for several months, and add this to the principal, so as to make the indebtedness equal to the cash surrender value. We do not think this should be permitted, nor do we think it was the intention of the parties. The interest not yet due should not be available to increase the amount of the indebtedness so as to forfeit the policy. The policy itself increased in value annually, although such increase was not <a id="p1047" href="#p1047" data-label="1047" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1047</a>available to the insured until the beginning of the next policy year, and the interest accrued, but not due, should not be available to the insurance company to increase the indebtedness so as to declare a forfeiture.</p>
    <p id="b1065-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1065.4",1065,[230,571,1203,148]]]'>There is some argument made about failure to pay defaulted interest. There was no defaulted interest, and there was no interest due until the following May.</p>

There were, of course, no premiums due, because this policy was paid up. Of course, if interest is calculated up to the time the company gave the notice, the indebtedxxess would equal the cash surrender value of the policy; but, in order to arrive at this result, interest that is not due must be added to the indebtedness, and we do not think there was any more intention of adding interest due in the future than there was in calculating the increased value of the policy, which would not be available until the beginning of the next policy year.</p>

    <p id="b1066-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1066.4",1066,[252,731,1202,190]]]'>In construing the contract most strongly against the insurance company, as we must do, we think it clear that the company did not have the right to declare a forfeiture at the time it did.</p>

Appellant insists that the United States Government has no lien and is not entitled to priority of payment of the funds paid to the guardian of the incompetent world war veteran by the Government under its laws and by him deposited in the failed bank. No claim was first made for priority of payment under the provisions of § 3466 of the Revised <a id="p1111" href="#p1111" data-label="1111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1111</a>Statutes of the United States (31 U. S. Code, § 191), nor could any valid claim have been made thereunder. The facts are undisputed: the payments were made to the guardian of the veteran under the provisions of the statute, the funds were received for the ward by the guardian and by him deposited as such guardian in the failed bank, and such funds were on deposit in the amount of $2,078.68 on November 15, 1930, when the depository bank became insolvent.</p>

Code, title 38,, § 450) does not grant priority of payment to any such funds, and § 3466 of the Revised Statutes (31 U. S. Code, § 191) cannot apply in this case, because the American Exchange Trust Company, the failed bank, was not indebted to the United States on account of the deposit of the compensation money paid by the Grovernment to the guardian of the incompetent world war veteran and by him deposited in the failed bank.</p>

After stating the terms of the act and citing cases from other jurisdictions construing it, the court said: “The World War Veterans’ Act of 1924 contains substantially the same exemption from seizure as is found in the War Bisk Insurance Act, and the cases cited which construe the latter act are applicable here.” And further: “we think the manifest purpose of the legislation making provision for World War Veterans was to devote the benefactions there provided to the sole use of the beneficiaries, and that the same should not be subject to the .demands of creditors, even after the money came into their hands or was held by another for their benefit.”</p>

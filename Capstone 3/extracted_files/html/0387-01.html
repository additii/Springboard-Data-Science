It would hardly seem probable that the vendors intended this as a present conveyance when only $300 out of $3,600, the amount of the purchase money, was paid. Although the instrument uses the words, “grant, bargain, and sell,” they are coupled with the added words, “and agree to convey”. When construed -with reference to these words and the <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>surrounding circumstances, it would seem to have been their intention to execute an executory instrument.</p>
    <p id="b417-5" data-blocks='[["BL_417.5",417,[163,520,1203,452]]]'>This view is strongly supported by the last clause of the instrument which binds Stewart to pay an agreed rental of $330 per annum. Then, too, the instrument binds the vendors to execute a warranty deed to the land, to be placed in escrow with a designated bank until the purchase price was paid. If the instrument is to he construed as a present conveyance, then there was no use to provide for the payment of rent or for the execution of this deed in escrow.</p>

If the section just quoted does not have the effect to create the relation of a landlord and tenant between the parties, it has no meaning whatever, and had just as well been left out of the contract. It was evidently placed in the contract for some purpose, and it would seem that the only purpose it could legitimately serve would be to create the relation of landlord and tenant between the <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>parties until tlie whole purchase price was paid. In this way the vendor could secure himself the payment of the purchase price, and without it he would have but little security.

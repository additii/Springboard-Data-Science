Texas, </em><a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">379 U.S. 476</a>, 485, <a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">85 S.

In this case, we are asked to evaluate a search warrant in a prosecution for possession of and dealing in depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. For guidance, we look to a 1992 case, <em>State v. Perrone, </em><a href="/wash-2d/119/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="119 Wash. 2d 538" data-case-ids="1370266" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/119/0538-01">119 Wn.2d 538</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=834%20P.2d%20611" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="834 P.2d 611">834 P.2d 611</a> (1992), that involved similar circumstances. We unanimously held that the <em>Perrone </em>warrant failed to meet the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment, in part because it provided for the seizure of items that were legal to possess, such as adult pornography. That holding is binding in this case, where the warrant similarly provided for the seizure of items that were legal to possess. The State contends that the warrant in this case is saved by a citation to the child pornography statute at the top of the warrant. The State is incorrect because the statutory citation does not modify or limit the items listed in the warrant, so it does not save the warrant from being overbroad. More importantly, the State’s posi<a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>tion conflicts with our reasoning in <em>Perrone </em>and would hinder the goals of the warrant particularity requirement. Because the warrant fails to meet the Constitution’s particularity requirement, we must reverse these convictions.</p>

After a friend of Swenson’s, Kellie Westfall, was arrested, she told police that she had seen drugs and child pornography at Besola’s house. Besóla was a veterinarian, and Westfall said that he provided prescription drugs from his veterinary clinic to Swenson, who was a drug addict.</p>

The State argues that the warrant is saved by a citation to the child pornography statute at the top of the warrant. As explained below, the State is incorrect. The statutory citation does not modify or limit the items listed in the warrant, so it does not save the warrant from being overbroad.

Second, it held that the description was too general under these circumstances because the warrant could easily have been made more particular if the language in the statute had been used to describe the materials sought. <em><a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">at 553-54</a>. The court suggested that “a <em>specific statement </em>of the type of contents which would render the material child pornography” would be sufficient. <em><a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">at 554</a>.

For instance, a reference to a specific illegal activity can sometimes provide guidance to an officer executing a search warrant. <em><a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">Id.</a> </em>But the court held that such a holding would be inappropriate because “so much of the rest of the warrant suffers from lack of probable cause and from insufficient particularity.” <em><a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">Id.</a> </em>Based on those three reasons, the court concluded that the term “child pornography” was invalid because it was insufficiently particular. <em><a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">Id.</a></em>

And certainly, if this search warrant had used the <em>language </em>of RCW 9.68A.011 <em>to describe materials sought, </em>the warrant would likely be sufficiently particular. But this warrant does not use the language of the statute; it simply notes the statutory citation. <em>See </em>CP at 312 (stating that the felony under investigation is “Possession of Child Pornography R.C.W. 9.68A.070” (boldface omitted)).

The warrant lists the crime under investigation and then separately lists the evidence that is material to that investigation, which police are then authorized to seize. <em>See <a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">id.</a> </em>The name of the felony at the top of the warrant does not modify or limit the list of items that can be seized via the warrant. This is evidenced by the plain language of the warrant, which introduces the list of evidence covered by the warrant with the statement, “[T]he following evidence is material to the investigation or prosecution of the above described felony.” <em><a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">Id.</a> </em>That sentence does not limit the evidence to be seized by referencing the <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>felony; it merely says that the evidence that follows is “material” to the investigation of that felony. Additionally, the State’s conclusion is inconsistent with the descriptions of the items to be seized. If the reference to the crime of possession of child pornography was meant to be read as limiting each item on the list, then the phrase “[a]ny photographs, but particularly of minors,” would not need the latter modifying phrase. <em><a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">Id.</a> </em>(boldface omitted).</p>

However, neither common sense nor practicality allows the court to assume there are limitations on a warrant’s scope where such limitations are plainly absent. Here, the warrant’s rote citation to the child pornography statute is at best ambiguous as to whether it limits the subsequent list of items to be seized. Because that ambiguity means the officers, rather than judges, will decide the scope, it fails not just <em>Perrone, </em>but the core purpose of the historically grounded particularity requirement. <em>See Stanford, </em><a href="/us/379/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="379 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="11731294" data-case-paths="/us/379/0476-01">379 U.S. at 485-86</a>.</p>

But more importantly, applying the Tenth Circuit’s holding to this warrant in particular would undermine the purposes of the particularity requirement.

When Mike Belenski requested certain records from Jefferson County (County), the County responded that it had “no responsive records.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 214. Over two years later, Belenski sued the County, asserting that this response violated the PRA because the County did in fact have such records and failed to make the proper disclosures.

One week later, the County mailed a response to Belenski’s “Public Records Request Dated September 27, 2010 - Internet access logs from February 1, 2010 to September 27, 2010,” stating that “the County has no responsive records.” CP at 214.

CP at 120. This led him to follow up through conversations with county employees and file other PRA requests (that are not before us). Eventually, Belenski discovered (through a separate public records response) e-mails between county employees sent shortly after his request admitting that the IALs existed during the relevant time period of Belenski’s PRA request, but suggesting the County need not provide them because they are not “natively viewable” and would need to be “pulled <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>out of a database and generated in a human readable format.” CP at 138.</p>

Instead, the Court of Appeals applied the two year catchall statute of limitations contained in the general chapter on “limitation of actions” in Washington’s civil procedure code, which states, “An action for relief not hereinbefore provided for, shall be commenced within two years after the cause of action shall have accrued.” RCW 4.16.130.</p>

Therefore, we adopt the one year statute of limitations in RCW 42.56.550(6) for causes of action under the PRA. Belenski’s claim here falls into that category, as he specifically requested to inspect IALs “[p]ursuant to the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56,” and now challenges the agency’s response as improper under the PRA.

The agency provided those notes and stated, “ T trust that this responds fully to your public disclosure request.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 511. After the requesters sued the agency for PRA violations, the Court of Appeals held that neither of these agency responses was sufficient to trigger the PRA statute of limitations.

Instead, the statute of limitations’ reference to bringing suit within one year of “the agency’s claim of exemption or the last production of a record on a partial or installment basis” indicates that the legislature intended to impose a one year statute of limitations beginning on an agency’s final, definitive response to a public records request.

Regardless of whether this answer was truthful or correct, the county’s definitive, final response to Belenski’s PRA request was sufficient to put him on notice that the County did not intend to disclose records or further address this request. If Belenski was unsatisfied with this answer, he could sue to hold the County in compliance with the PRA as soon as it gave this response—there was no need for him to wait an additional 25 months before bringing his cause of action.</p>

On one hand, we recognize that such an incentive could be contrary to the broad disclosure mandates of the PRA and may be fundamentally unfair in certain circumstances; on the other hand, certain facts in this specific case indicate that Belenski knew the County possessed IAL data, yet he inexplicably waited over two years <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>before filing his claim.

The holding in <em>Rental Housing </em>was limited to the timeliness of claims when an agency attempts to claim an exemption and discusses how the agency must claim an exemption to begin the limitations period. In contrast, in this case the County never attempted to claim an exemption and, instead, simply stated that it had “no responsive records.’’ Therefore, <em>Rental Housing </em>is distinguishable, and the limitations period here should begin to run on this final, definitive response.</p>

This turns the PRA on its head. I would hold that Jefferson County’s response to Mike Belenski’s public records request was false, the response did not comply with the PRA, the statute of limitations under the PRA was never triggered, and the lawsuit was timely. This court should embrace a rule prohibiting the government from enjoying the protections of the PRA’s statute of limitations when responding falsely to records requests.

Perhaps the holding in <em>Tobin </em>would be too narrowly applied in cases where the government responds truthfully and accurately to a records request, but that is not what happened in <em>Tobin. </em>In that case, the Court of Appeals did nothing more than apply the words of the PRA’s statute of limitations as written. In <em>Tobin, </em>Susan Tobin repeatedly requested from the county copies of any complaints against her property. After her first request, the county sent her a copy of a one-page, handwritten complaint with some portions redacted.

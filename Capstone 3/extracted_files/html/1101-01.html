At the time of his injury, hereinafter mentioned, he was engaged in stenciling coal cars. It was usual and customary to do this work out in the yards in the open in good weather, but on the morning of October 23, 1930, the date of the injury complained of, it was raining to such extent that such work could not proceed in the open, and about 1 p. m. of said date, the rain continuing, the foreman caused ten coal cars to be moved under the sheds, and directed appellee to stencil the cars. There were a number of tracks under the sheds about eight or ten feet apart. There had been stacked a°pile of grain strips between the track on which the coal cars were placed and another, same being about two feet wide and one and one-half or two feet high and held together by stakes driven in the ground. These grain strips were three-cornered pieces of wood of about two-inch faces, about thirty feet long, and were used in coal cars to prevent wastage of bulk grain when shipped therein. Some three or four of these strips had fallen off the pile. In moving from one place to another in doing his work, and while carrying his ladder, appellee stepped on said grain strips, which gave way and caused him to fall, injuring his back.</p>
    <p id="b1122-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1122.8",1122,[307,1745,1199,96]]]'>A suit by appellee against appellant resulted in a verdict and judgment against appellant.</p>
    <p id="b1122-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1122.9",1122,[308,1854,1198,245]]]'>The only error urged for a reversal of the judgment by appellant is that the court erred in refusing to direct a verdict in its favor on its request, on the ground that the undisputed evidence shows appellee assumed the risk. We must agree with appellant in this contention.</p>

He testified himself that he saw the strips, knew some three or four of them had fallen off the pile, and that the pile was higher than the stakes that held them. It is not clear whether he stepped on the pile and slipped, or whether on one of those that had fallen off, but in either event he must have known that to do so might cause him to fall. If was not incumbent therefore upon appellant to warn him of such danger, as whatever danger there might be was apparent. As said by this court in <em>Crawfordsville Trust Co., </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em><a href="/ark/121/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="121 Ark. 556" data-case-ids="1559395" data-case-paths="/ark/121/0556-01">121 Ark. 556</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=181%20S.W.%20904" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="181 S.W. 904">181 S.

Co. </em>v. <em>Lane, ante </em>p. 807, we said: “He was unloading this car in broad open daylight, and the only excuse he gives for not seeing the oil and thereby avoiding it is that he did not look.

The Court of Appeals reversed Benito Gomez’s convictions for second degree murder and six counts of first degree assault on the grounds that the trial judge effected an unconstitutional closure of the courtroom during trial by his pretrial comment that the public would not be permitted to enter the courtroom once the proceedings began. First, we disagree that the trial judge, by mere virtue of making this remark, fully excluded the public from entering the courtroom and, thus, we have no basis for finding a constitutional violation.

In denying the motion, the court made a few comments regarding the spectators of the proceedings: “This is a public courthouse.

Smith, </em><a href="/wash-2d/181/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="181 Wash. 2d 508" data-case-ids="4356663" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/181/0508-01">181 Wn.2d 508</a>, 513-14, <a href="/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%201049" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="334 P.3d 1049">334 P.3d 1049</a> (2014). In this case, neither party disputes that the public trial right attaches to the regular proceedings and that because the judge did not consider the <em>Bone-Club </em>factors, a closure of those proceedings would not be justified, so steps (1) and (3) need no analysis. Only the second step requires our review: whether the judge’s comment alone effected an actual closure of the courtroom during the trial. Our cases have largely used a case-by-case approach in determining when a closure occurs, but we have established some general guidelines.</p>

The only evidence in this record supportive of a possible closure is the judge’s comment on the first day of trial, which Gomez contends amounted to a “ruling” for “a general prohibition for spectators and an exclusion of the public from the trial.” Resp’t’s Suppl. Br. at 5. Far short of an actual ruling, the judge said, “We do not allow people to come into the courtroom after [it] is in session.” 2 VRP at 153. The judge also commented, “This is a public courthouse. Everyone in the public is entitled to appear in this courthouse for appropriate matters, as either litigants or spectators or witnesses.” 2 VRP at 150. The judge did not explicitly <em>order </em>a closure of the courtroom, such that we can conclusively determine that the statement itself was meant to prevent people from entering or to compel spectators to leave. Rather, the judge made the remark in the context of a lengthy ruling on venue, he mentioned it only once during the proceedings, and there is no other indication in the record that the court directed the exclusion of any spectators or that anyone else acted to close the trial to the public. The record shows the opposite here: that the courtroom was rather full of spectators and none were asked to leave. Given our existing definition of a “closure,” something more must be shown from the record.</p>

As in <em>Lormor, </em>the exclusion of only one or a few individuals is a matter of courtroom operations, in which the trial judge possesses broad discretion “to preserve and enforce order in the courtroom and to provide for the orderly conduct of its proceedings.” <em>Lormor, </em>172 Wn.2d at 93-94.

First, the State argues that using an experience and logic analysis, this court should find that the trial court did not effect a closure because, historically and logically, judges have possessed wide discretion in controlling the courtroom and maintaining decorum. Pet’r’s Suppl. Br. at 7. But the State’s reliance on that analysis is misplaced: we employ the experience and logic analysis to determine whether the public trial right attaches to a particular proceeding or portion of the proceedings. <em>State v. Sublett, </em><a href="/wash-2d/176/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="176 Wash. 2d 58" data-case-ids="4306367" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/176/0058-01">176 Wn.2d 58</a>, 72-73, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20P.3d%20715" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="292 P.3d 715">292 P.3d 715</a> (2012) (plurality opinion). There is no question here that the right attaches to the regular trial proceedings.</p>
      <p id="b91-9" data-blocks='[["BL_91.8",91,[97,2131,1248,259]]]'>Second, the State argues that if we do find that the comment effected a closure, the closure was de minimis in nature and does not warrant reversal. The State argues that our ruling in <em>State v. Shearer, </em><a href="/wash-2d/181/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="181 Wash. 2d 564" data-case-ids="4356699" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/181/0564-01">181 Wn.2d 564</a>, 573, <a href="/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%201078" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="334 P.3d 1078">334 P.3d 1078</a> (2014) (plurality opinion), in which we said that the structural nature of the public trial violation “forecloses the possibility of de minimis violations,” should not apply here because unlike <em>Shearer, </em>the record reveals that the public was actually present during the proceedings. We do not reach that issue here.</p>

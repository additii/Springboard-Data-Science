Well within the relevant <a id="p805" href="#p805" data-label="805" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*805</a>statutes of limitations, Swagerty was charged with first degree rape of a child and first degree child molestation. Because of his criminal history, he faced a life sentence if convicted as charged. In order to avoid a life sentence, Swagerty pleaded guilty to four lesser offenses in 2013. However, the statute of limitations had run on three of the amended charges. Swagerty seeks to vacate those three convictions and be resentenced only on the one remaining charge. We hold that a criminal defendant may expressly waive an expired statute of limitations on lesser charges during plea negotiations to take advantage of a favorable plea offer. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals in part and remand to the trial court with direction to allow Swagerty a choice of two options: (1) he may withdraw his personal restraint petition, effectively keeping to the plea bargain he made, or (2) he may keep the victory he won at the Court of Appeals and move to vacate the 2013 judgment and sentence, and the State will have the opportunity to refile the original charges.</p>

It is difficult to imagine what evidence or strategy could have overcome the documented presence of Swagerty’s DNA in the victim’s underwear, and Swagerty identifies none.

Legal errors in offender score calculations may be raised for the first time on collateral review when the error is apparent on the face of the judgment and sentence “without further elaboration.” <em>In re Pers.

Although the statute of limitations for the three latter charges had expired, Swagerty pleaded guilty to and received a 30-year sentence for the four lesser charges rather than the life sentence he might otherwise have received.

This remedy is not available, and as explained below, several rules together direct us to the proper remedy: to vacate the entire plea agreement.</p>

In <em>Stoudmire, </em>we held that the defendant’s restraint on expired charges resulted “in a complete miscarriage of justice.” 141 Wn.2d at 355. Here, the State concedes that three of the four charges <a id="p817" href="#p817" data-label="817" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*817</a>were subject to statutes of limitation that had expired before Swagerty was sentenced. In <em>Peltier, </em>we said that defendants may expressly waive a statute of limitations to his or her own advantage (to plead guilty to a lesser charge, for instance), but that this waiver must occur before the limit has expired while the court still has authority to sentence on those charges. 181 Wn.2d at 297-98. Here, Swagerty did not expressly waive the statute of limitations. Since the convictions rest on expired charges without waiver, Swagerty’s continued restraint based on those three charges would be unlawful. Swagerty asks that we vacate those three convictions and resentence him as to the remaining unexpired charge. However, the next important rule instructs us as to why that is not the appropriate remedy.</p>

Since the statute of limitations had expired on three of the four charges, those convictions are contrary to our law. Under our law, one problematic charge in a plea agreement can spoil the whole bushel when it is indivisible. <em>State v.

When a conviction rests on an invalid plea agreement, the proper remedy is to vacate the conviction to “place the parties back in the position they were in before they entered into the agreement.” <em>In re Pers.

Both the State and Swa-gerty will be placed back in the position that they were in before they entered into the agreement. Not only is that the legally accurate outcome, but it is important to bear in mind that Swagerty himself challenged the validity of these convictions. Rather than face a potential life sentence with the original charge of first degree child rape, Swagerty accepted the benefit of the plea agreement. That was his choice. He then chose to challenge the validity of those convictions in spite of that benefit. It is no failure of justice to give Swagerty what he asked for. I would affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>

      <a id="p824" href="#p824" data-label="824" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*824</a>¶43 Based on the clear holdings of <em>Stoudmire </em>and <em>Peltier, </em>the three charges for which the statute of limitations had run must be vacated and Swagerty should be resentenced on the single remaining charge. The majority and the Court of Appeals view this result as unjust, and seek to avoid it by characterizing the plea as indivisible under <em>Turley. See </em>majority at 812; <em>In re Pers. Restraint of Swagerty, </em>No. 45862-4-II, slip op. at 4 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 21, 2015) (unpublished), http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions /pdf/D2%2045862-4-II%20%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. <em>Turley, </em>however, is inapplicable because Swagerty is not seeking to withdraw his plea.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">8</a>
      <em>See Knight, </em>162 Wn.2d at 813 (holding <em>Turley </em>did not prevent the court from vacating a single conviction obtained through an indivisible plea agreement where the defendant did “not seek to withdraw her guilty pleas”). Swagerty asks us to “vacate the three counts [for which the statute of limitations had run] and remand for resentencing on count I.” Suppl. Br of Pet’r at 15. This is the same remedy we provided in <em>Stoudmire. See </em>141 Wn.2d at 356 (vacating convictions where the statute of limitations ran before charging, and remanding for resen-tencing on the remaining counts). <em>Knight </em>also supports this remedy and, as an analogous case, aptly explains why the indivisibility of the plea is irrelevant.</p>

She then appealed, arguing that two of <a id="p825" href="#p825" data-label="825" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*825</a>the convictions violated double jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at 809. The question before the court was whether “a single conviction can be vacated for a double jeopardy violation without rejecting an indivisible plea agreement.” <em>Id. </em>at 810. We held, “[V] acating a conviction is the proper remedy when the conviction violates double jeopardy, even when entered pursuant to an indivisible plea agreement.” <em>Id. </em>at 808.</p>
    <p id="b863-4" data-blocks='[["BL_863.4",863,[197,728,1251,944]]]'>¶45 The court explained that double jeopardy prevents the court from entering “ ‘multiple convictions for the same offense.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 813 (quoting <em>State v. Womac, </em><a href="/wash-2d/160/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="160 Wash. 2d 643" data-case-ids="3631169" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/160/0643-01">160 Wn.2d 643</a>, 658, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20P.3d%2040" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="160 P.3d 40">160 P.3d 40</a> (2007)). “The proper remedy for double jeopardy violations ... is vacating the offending convictions.” <em>Id. </em>at 812. This was true even when the conviction was entered pursuant to a plea agreement, where that agreement did not waive double jeopardy protections. <em>See id. </em>at 813. “[T]he plea agreement has no bearing on the ability of the court to vacate a conviction entered pursuant to the guilty plea itself, because the plea itself need not be disturbed.” <em>Id. </em>at 812. Because Knight did not seek to withdraw her guilty pleas, and her plea agreement did not waive double jeopardy protections, “the indivisibility of the plea agreement ha[d] no bearing on our analysis.” <em>Id. </em>at 813. The court vacated the conviction that violated double jeopardy, even though it was entered into as part of an indivisible plea agreement. <em>Id.</em>

    <p id="b863-5" data-blocks='[["BL_863.5",863,[197,1693,1251,686]]]'>¶46 Statutes of limitations, like double jeopardy, limit the power of the court. <em>See Stoudmire, </em>141 Wn.2d at 355. Although double jeopardy is a constitutional limitation, and statutes of limitations are legislatively imposed, they both restrict the court’s authority to enter judgment against the defendant. There is nothing in the reasoning of Knight’s holding that limits it to cases of double jeopardy, particularly in light of the continuing validity of <em>Stoudmire </em>and <em>Peltier. </em>Because the court lacked the authority to enter judgment against Swagerty on three of the convictions at the time he entered into the plea agreement, we must vacate those charges and remand for resentencing on the remaining valid conviction.</p>

      <a id="p826" href="#p826" data-label="826" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*826</a>¶47 The majority resists this clear mandate from binding precedent and instead offers Swagerty the choice of either withdrawing his personal restraint petition or withdrawing his entire plea. <em>See </em>majority at 809-10. Neither option is tenable. The former impermissibly expands the authority of the court to enter judgment against a defendant once the statute of limitations has already run. <em>See Peltier, </em>181 Wn.2d at <em>297;Stoudmire, </em>141 Wn.2d at 355. The latter forces Swagerty to face the very peril he specifically sought to avoid by entering into the plea agreement. <em>Cf. State v. Hall, </em><a href="/wash-2d/162/0901-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="162 Wash. 2d 901" data-case-ids="3696420" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/162/0901-01">162 Wn.2d 901</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=177%20P.3d%20680" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="177 P.3d 680">177 P.3d 680</a> (2008) (holding double jeopardy prohibits the State from moving to vacate a criminal conviction against the defendant’s objection). I share the majority’s dissatisfaction with a result that seems to give Swagerty a windfall, but I believe an occasional unsatisfying outcome is the acceptable cost of consistently applying settled legal rules. Moreover, I am confident that this situation need not arise again. The parties and trial courts in future cases can assure that plea agreements conform to the limits of judicial authority and contain appropriate express waiver provisions. I respectfully dissent.</p>

In fact, waiver was the central issue, aas the State in each case argued that defendant’s guilty plea agreement expressly waived the statute of limitations. <em>See Stoudmire, </em>141 Wn.2d at 354 (“[T]he State argues that Stoudmire is not entitled to relief because his guilty plea waives any challenge to the charging dates in counts I and II.”); <em>Peltier, </em>181 Wn.2d at 293-94 (“The State argued that Peltier waived his right to object to the statute of limitations in the agreement upon stipulation.”). This court in <em>Stoudmire </em>squarely held that the defendant could not waive the statute of limitations because “ ‘[a] plea bargaining agreement cannot exceed the statutory authority given to the courts.’ ” <em>Stoudmire, </em>141 Wn.2d at 355 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Moore, </em>116 Wn.2d at 38). Later explaining why this holding did not require invalidating Peltier’s plea to then-timely charges, the court recognized that <em>Stoudmire </em>addressed the issue of waiver and held that a defendant “could not consent to be charged or waive any objection to the untimely charging.” <em>Peltier, </em>181 Wn.2d at 297.

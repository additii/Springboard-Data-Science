The act provides, among other things, for the assessment of benefits on the real property in the district, for making the amount of the assessment against each piece of real property a lien thereon, and for the collection of the benefits in annual installments. The method provided for enforcing delinquent assessments is by suit in the chancery court to foreclose the lien of the assessment, leading, as in other cases of foreclosure, to the sale of the property by a commissioner of the court appointed for that purpose.</p>
    <p id="b501-7" data-blocks='[["BL_501.8",501,[176,1145,1205,825]]]'>The lots owned by appellees are described as lots 8 and 9, in block 4, of East End Place, an addition to the city of Port Smith. Prior to the assessment of benefits a house had been built on the lots, a portion thereof being on each lot, and when the betterments were assessed the two lots were assessed as a single tract. The value of the lots was assessed at $4,000, and the annual benefit installment payable each year was $5. The 1927 installment was not paid, and a decree was rendered to enforce payment, pursuant to which the lots were sold to Ed Haglin, as a single tract, for the sum of $10, and upon the expiration of the time allowed for redemption, redemption not being made, a commissioner’s deed was executed and approved by the court. A short time before this sale a loan of $2,300 was obtained on the security of the property from a local building and loan association.</p>

    <p id="b503-3" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[184,472,1206,871]]]'>The property involved in the Cassady case was there referred to as “the lot in controversy.” As a matter of fact, the transcript in the case shows that the property involved was a half-lot. It was there insisted “that the sale was invalid because there was no notice to the effect that ‘only so much of the property shall be sold as will pay the assessment, costs and penalty and no more.’ Kirby’s Digest, § 5700.” A comparison of this section with § 25 of act 104 of the Acts of 1913 shows that the latter was copied from the former. The court there held that upon collateral attack the omission to state that only so much of the property would be sold as was required to pay the assessment, costs and penalty was a question which could not be raised. However, it was not held that this was an irregularity, but only that, if so, it was an irregularity which had been cured by the confirmation of the sale.</p>
    <p id="b503-4" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[182,1359,1206,925]]]'>We have here a different question. The provisions of § 5700, Kirby’s Digest, and those also of § 25 of act 104 of 1913, would apply in applicable cases, whether the notice of sale recited them or not, and we do not think this recital in the notice of sale would be essential to the validity of the sale in either case. Neither provides that the notice of sale shall recite that only so much of the property shall be sold as is necessary to pay the assessment, etc., but the direction is that only that quantity shall be sold, and the sale is subject to this statute, whether the notice recited its provisions or not. It is not stated in the opinion in the Cassady case, <em>supra, </em>that the sale was not made in conformity with § 5700, Kirby’s Digest. The contention was that the notice of sale did not recite that it would be so sold; whereas in the instant case the fact is that the sale did not conform to the requirements df § 25 of act 104, and the form of the notice is therefore unimportant.</p>

The objections to the form of notice of sale were overruled, the opinion holding, in effect, that statutory requirements regarding such sales would be read into the notice, and need not be recited in it.</p>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[280,614,1199,100]]]'>We conclude therefore that the Cassady case does not foreclose the question here presented.</p>

W. 461</a>, is cited in the note, to the text last quoted. In this Richards case a tax sale was made under a statute which required that the whole tract should be sold to the person offering to pay the highest price therefor, but the deed to the tax purchaser showed that the least quantity of the land was sold that any one would take and pay the taxes, penalty and costs charged against it, and that, no one having offered to pay them for less than the whole of the tract, it (the entire tract) was struck off to the person who offered to pay that price. In holding that <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>the sale was void as not having been made in conformity with law, Judge Battle said: “But it may be said that the whole tract sold only for the taxes, penalty and costs, and the original owner was not affected or prejudiced. How can this be truly said when it was not offered to the highest bidder? No one can tell how much it would ha-ve sold for, had it been sold in the manner prescribed by law. Some one might have given more for the entire tract, when he would not have paid the taxes, penalty and costs for less than the whole. It might have sold for more; it could not have brought less. The owner was entitled to the experiment. The collector had no authority to take it from him, and constitute himself the judge of what was for his benefit. The sale in question was void.”</p>

These lots were sold for taxes amounting to $5, with penalty and costs in addition. Can it be said that no one would have paid this small sum for one or the other of these lots had they been separately offered for sale, as the statute, requires ? As was said by Judge Battle in the Richards case, <em>supra, </em>the owner was entitled to the experiment.</p>

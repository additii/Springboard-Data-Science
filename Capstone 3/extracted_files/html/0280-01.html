Appellants first urge that the verdict against each appellant is not supported by the testimony. The basis for appellant’s contention as to no liability against McKewen is put upon the following grounds:</p>
    <p id="b301-2" data-blocks='[["BL_301.3",301,[168,331,1201,813]]]'>
      <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>That MeKewen, prior to procuring the warrant of arrest, gave a full and fair statement of all the known facts to the public prosecutor, and he followed this advice. It suffices to say, in reference to this contention, that MeKewen’s testimony is flatly contradicted by that of the public prosecutor. This officer was a witness in the case and testified that, if MeKewen had revealed all the facts when in his office, he would not have issued an information. It is true, of course, had MeKewen given a full and fair statement of all the known facts in reference to the controversy to the public prosecutor, then had acted upon the advice of such official, it would be a complete defense. The jury found that MeKewen did not make a full and fair statement of all the known facts to the public prosecutor, and its finding in this regard is supported by the testimony.</p>
    <p id="b301-3" data-blocks='[["BL_301.4",301,[168,1150,1200,351]]]'>It is next said, in behalf of appellant MeKewen, that the evidence fails to establish either want of probable cause or malice. This court held, in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Orblitt, </em><a href="/ark/131/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="131 Ark. 408" data-case-ids="1578611" data-case-paths="/ark/131/0408-01">131 Ark. 408</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20S.W.%2091" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="199 S.W. 91">199 S. W. 91</a>, that, in an action for damages for malicious prosecution, malice may be inferred where there was a lack of probable cause, even though there was no express showing of malice.</p>
    <p id="b301-4" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[169,1505,1199,141]]]'>We also said in <em>Cable </em>v. Carey, <a href="/ark/135/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="135 Ark. 137" data-case-ids="1571567" data-case-paths="/ark/135/0137-01">135 Ark. 137</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=204%20S.W.%20748" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="204 S.W. 748">204 S.

    <p id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.6",301,[168,1660,1200,553]]]'>On the question of probable cause in the instant case but little need be said. Really, there can be no doubt but that appellant MeKewen knew that appellee had no intention of stealing either the truck or the merchandise thereon. Without reviewing the testimony in this regard, it suffices to say that the jury was fully warranted in finding that appellant MeKewen had no reason, cause or excuse for instituting the criminal prosecution against appellee. If appellant MeKewen instituted the prosecution without probable cause, and we have no hesitancy in saying that he did so, then malice may be inferred.</p>
    <p id="b301-6" data-blocks='[["BL_301.7",301,[169,2217,1199,201]],["BL_302.1",302,[299,321,1203,1362]]]'>Neither do we hesitate in saying that the testimony here presented fully warranted the jury in finding that the criminal prosecution instituted against appellee by appellant MeKewen was without probable cause and with <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>malice. The contention, in reference to the nonliability of the Louisiana Oil Refining Corporation, is grounded upon the contention that McKewen, in obtaining the warrant of arrest in the criminal prosecution, was acting in his own right and not in aid of any business'being transacted for the oil company, and that appellee was charged with stealing property of McKewen and not that of the oil corporation. The argument is that McKewen had a special ownership in the property and was fully justified in treating it as his-own, and that the criminal prosecution was instituted against appellee in protection of this special ownership. On this question the jury was fully warranted in finding that McKewen was the agent and local manager of the appellant oil company in Stuttgart ; also that he had the exclusive possession and control of the oil plant and merchandise located in that vicinity. The sale and disbursements of all the oil company’s products in that vicinity was under the exclusive control of McKewen. Naturally, McKewen had the duty of protecting and preserving appellant oil company’s merchandise, which had been theretofore entrusted to his care. In furtherance of the performance of this duty, he had the apparent authority to do and perform any and all things necessary for the preservation and protection of said property. This court expressly so decided in <em>Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Gage, </em><a href="/ark/136/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="136 Ark. 122" data-case-ids="1569965" data-case-paths="/ark/136/0122-01">136 Ark. 122</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=206%20S.W.%20141" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="206 S.W. 141">206 S.

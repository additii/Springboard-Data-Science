By so instructing the jury, the trial court eliminated all issues joined on liability, assumed risk, contributory negligence, etc., holding that the Miller County Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to try and determine the cause under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, upon which act appellant sought to recover.</p>

    <p id="b420-3" data-blocks='[["BL_420.4",420,[285,1163,1198,403]]]'>We do not think driving the engine out of the yard into the roundhouse for its federal monthly routine inspection and for necessary repairs disclosed by said inspection, which were of a minor nature, under order of the United States Government, changed its character as an interstate instrumentality, especially in the light of the fact that it was to be and was returned to its accustomed use as soon as inspected and repaired.</p>
    <p id="b420-4" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[284,1588,1197,196]]]'>It was not a road engine removed from an interstate haul indefinitely or for any considerable length of time for repairs, nor was it a disabled, broken-down engine which was to all intents and purposes out of commission.</p>

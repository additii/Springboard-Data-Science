The trial court imposed a standard range sentence of 116 months of confinement and ordered community custody for a period of “at least 4 months, plus all accrued earned early release time at the time of release.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 7. Bruch challenges his sentence, arguing that the court-imposed term of community custody is indeterminate and may exceed the statutory requirement of three years of community custody required under RCW 9.94A.701(1). The Court of Appeals rejected Bruch’s challenge. So do we.</p>
    <p id="b893-4" data-blocks='[["BL_893.8",893,[125,1002,1256,1387]]]'>¶2 We hold that Bruch’s sentence complied with all statutory requirements. The trial court properly reduced the three-year term of community custody to a fixed, four months so that the total sentence did not exceed the applicable statutory maximum, consistent with RCW 9.94A-.701(9). While the court recognized the Department of Corrections’ (DOC) authority to transfer Bruch to community custody “in lieu of earned release time,” as described under RCW 9.94A.729(5)(a), this did not render the sentence indeterminate. The statutory scheme contemplates that an offender might serve more time in community custody than imposed by the sentencing court under RCW 9.94A.701 if he earns early release pursuant to RCW 9.94A.729. There is no need for the trial court to amend Bruch’s sentence to limit community custody to a maximum of three years. The statutes must be read together to assure that the trial court’s intended sentence — a total term of 120 months — is not undermined by giving effect to the DOC’s authority to transfer earned early release into community custody. Even assuming that RCW 9.94A.701(1) limits the period of community custody the DOC can supervise under RCW 9.94A.729(5), the judgment and sentence remains valid; it need not direct how the DOC will exercise its authority in accordance with all applicable provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), ch. 9.94A RCW. We affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>

These offenses were committed sometime between January 26, 2007 and January 25, 2011. Then, as now, child molestation in the second degree was a class B felony punishable by a maximum term of 120 months, RCW 9A.44.086(2); RCW 9A.20.021(l)(b), and rape of a child in the third degree was a class C felony punishable by a maximum term of 60 months, RCW 9A.44.079(2); RCW 9A.20.021(l)(c).</p>

RCW 9.94A.701(1). However, at the time of Bruch’s sentencing, as now, the SRA prohibited trial courts from imposing a term of community custody that would, in combination with a defendant’s term of confinement, exceed the statutory maximum for the crime. RCW 9.94A.505(5). Trial courts are required to “reduce[ ]” a term of community custody that, in combination with the term of confinement, may exceed the statutory maximum for the crime. RCW 9.94A.701(9). In order to avoid exceeding the 120-month statutory maximum for the combined term of confinement and community custody, the trial court sentenced Bruch to only four months of community custody: 120 months (the statutory maximum for a class B felony) minus 116 months (the term of confinement imposed).</p>

Majority at 860 (citing former RCW 9.94A.710G), .712(5), .715(1) (2008)). The majority is also correct that the 2009 amendments eliminated this range-based community custody scheme and replaced it with a requirement that trial courts impose a community custody term of 3 years, 18 months, or 1 year, depending on the offense at hand, and then “reduce! ]” that term so that it does not combine with the term of confinement to exceed the statutory maximum for the underlying crime.

Indeed, the Final Bill Report that accompanied the 2009 amendment indicates that the amendment’s primary purpose was to reduce the number of offenders that are subject to DOC supervision while serving terms of community custody.

The mandate to transfer early release time to community custody in RCW 9.94A.729 is directed to the DOC, not the trial court. <em>See Franklin, </em>172 Wn.2d at 837 &amp; n.8. The scope of the DOC’s obligations under RCW 9.94A.729 is not before us, but we will not presume that in fulfilling these obligations, the DOC will act in a manner that is contrary to the SRA. <em>See Brooks, </em>166 Wn.2d at 672-73 (noting the DOC’s statutory discretion with regard to community custody); <em>Franklin, </em>172 Wn.2d at 843 (refusing to order amendment of judgment and sentence where the DOC can act within authority consistent with the SRA).</p>

      <p id="b906-9" data-blocks='[["BL_906.9",906,[189,1730,1250,635]]]'> The State suggests that Bruch’s judgment and sentence should be corrected to expressly state that both types of community custody run concurrently from the date of release. It believes this is what the legislature intended when it required an offender to be “ <em>‘transferred </em>to community custody in lieu of earned early release time.’ ” Suppl. Br. of Resp’t at 8 (emphasis added) (quoting RCW 9.94A-.729(5)(a)). But, the meaning of “transferred” in this context is not entirely clear. The same statute allows the DOC to “transfer” an offender to partial confinement when he does not qualify for community custody. RCW 9.94A.729(5)(d)(i). As noted, the limits of the DOC’s authority under RCW 9.94A.729 are not before us. For present purposes, it is enough to note that the trial court’s reference to “at least 4 months, plus all accrued earned early release time at the time of release,” CP at 7, is not inconsistent with running the court-imposed period of community custody concurrently with the period resulting under RCW 9.94A.729, if that is what the DOC is required to do. The trial court’s language can be understood as recognizing the separate statutory sources for community custody and reflecting its intent that both will apply, i.e., that Bruch will be subject to the court-imposed term <em>plus </em>the DOC-granted term.</p>

It is insisted, on behalf of appellant, that this case is ruled by <em>City Oil Works </em>v. <em>Helena Improvement District No. 1, </em><a href="/ark/149/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="149 Ark. 285" data-case-ids="8719232" data-case-paths="/ark/149/0285-01">149 Ark. 285</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=232%20S.W.%2028" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="232 S.W. 28">232 S.

In the McCoy case the alleged damages accrued'by reason of the construction of the levee in the first instance. This court held in effect that the levee district was not liable to a property owner for damages accruing by reason of the construction of the levee. In the City Oil Works case it was determined that it was necessary to move the levee back and cut off the oil'mill between the new levee and the river because of the caving in of the old levee. It.was not contended in either case that taxes had been paid to the district for a long number of years. In the instant case appellee has paid taxes to the levee district for the past thirty years and had a perfect right to expect that his lands would continue to be protected by the levee. This, in our opinion, differentiates the instant case from either of the cases cited <em>supra.</em>

Consistent with the pattern jury instructions on witness intimidation, the jury was instructed that “[a]s used in these instructions, threat <em>also </em>means to communicate, directly or indirectly, the intent immediately to use force against any person who is present at the time.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 40 (Instruction 9) (emphasis added); <em>see </em>11 Washington Practice: Washington Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal 2.24, at 71-72 (3d ed. 2008) (WPIC). There was no evidence presented that France, who was in jail when he made the calls, intended immediately to use force against any person present at the time of the charged conduct. France contends under the law of the case doctrine, his felony harassment convictions must be dismissed. The State argues that the instructions, taken as a whole, accurately informed the jury of the elements of felony harassment and that it presented sufficient evidence to sustain France’s convictions.

No party in this case argues that the elements listed in the to-convict instructions were erroneous or were not supported by the evidence presented.

However, this is because “true threat” defines and limits the scope of criminal statutes, such as felony harassment, that potentially encroach on protected speech. <em>Allen, </em>176 Wn.2d at 626 (quoting <em>Kilburn, </em>151 Wn.2d at 43). The First Amendment to the United States Constitution broadly protects speech but not “true threats”— statements “made in a ‘context or under such circumstances wherein a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted ... as a serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm upon or to take the life’ of another person.” <em>Kilburn, </em>151 Wn.2d at 43 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>State v.

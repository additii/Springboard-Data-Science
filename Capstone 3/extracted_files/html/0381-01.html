It is your duty to reconcile the statements of these different witnesses, so as to believe as much of this testimony as you can, but if you cannot do so on account of contradictions, then you have the right to believe the witnesses whom you think the most worthy of credit, and disbelieve the witnesses who you believe from the evidence to be the least worthy of credit.

The true rule is that the credibility of a witness who knowingly testifies falsely as to one or more material facts is wholly a matter for the jury.

He <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>has done so. It is clear that defense trial counsel’s failure to interview three previously identified and easily accessible eyewitnesses before trial constituted deficient performance. This deficiency also caused prejudice: it deprived Jones of the opportunity to develop a theory of the case that Jones was the victim rather than the aggressor, and it deprived him of neutral bystander eyewitness testimony in support of that theory. When considering the case as a whole, defense counsel failed to provide the meaningful adversarial role that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees. Following <em>Strickland, </em>we must reverse.</p>
    <p id="b385-4" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[105,1027,1255,808]]]'>¶3 Jones also argues that two prior Florida assault convictions should not have been used to increase his sentence because they are not “comparable” (per RCW 9.94A.525(3)) to second degree assault in Washington for “persistent offender” sentencing purposes. The difference is that Florida courts reject the defense of “diminished capacity” that Washington courts accept as a defense to this specific-intent crime. Because this issue might arise again if there is a retrial, we address it here also. Recently, in <em>State v. Sublett, </em><a href="/wash-2d/176/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="176 Wash. 2d 58" data-case-ids="4306367" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/176/0058-01">176 Wn.2d 58</a>, 88-89, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20P.3d%20715" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="292 P.3d 715">292 P.3d 715</a> (2012) (plurality opinion), we held that a difference in the availability of this particular defense — diminished capacity — is not relevant to whether the out-of-state conviction is “comparable” to an otherwise nearly identical Washington crime. Thus, the trial court did not err in its sentencing calculations.</p>

According to the transcript of the defense interview filed with the trial court in support of the motion for a new trial, Hamilton said that he was at the bus stop when the fight occurred and that he was standing very close to Alford and Jones. He was certain that the younger man (Alford) tackled the older man (Jones) and started beating him before the young man’s friends joined in. Hamilton said, “I did not see the actual extraction of the knife. I did see it in his hand after he had been tackled and after [Alford] started hitting him.” CP at 223. Hamilton also stated, “[W]hat I saw was guy number two [Alford] tackled guy number one [Jones], then the knife coming out, subdued the knife [in the hand of guy number one]. . . . Guy number <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>three came up, clocked him, a beating ensued, and I called 911 and went away on the bus.” CP at 226. Hamilton believed that the police were bound to get the wrong idea when they arrived and would think that the young men were restraining an armed attacker. CP at 225. Hamilton believed that the older man (Jones) was acting in self-defense. Hamilton also said that he was with another man who would have testified to the same thing, but because no one contacted him sooner, he could no longer remember the other man’s name. According to police reports filed in support of the new trial motion, Hamilton’s name and phone number were recorded on a 911 dispatch report provided to the prosecutor and to the defense through discovery, but neither party contacted Hamilton before the trial.</p>

The trial court concluded that the failure to interview Brown before trial was not prejudicial because Brown ultimately testified at trial. CP at 888. The trial court also concluded that the failure to interview Hamilton was not prejudicial because “Hamilton’s proposed testimony is not exculpatory because it contradicts the defense position at trial. At trial defendant testified he drew the knife in self-defense after he was assaulted by Alford and his two friends.” CP at 889. The trial court clearly erred on this point: Jones did not testify at trial.</p>

The trial judge conducted the hearing, at which the original defense counsel testified about Hamilton and Brown, as well as the witness defense counsel was unable to contact before trial— Ooveda. The court concluded that the failure to call Brown and Ooveda was deficient but did not prejudice Jones. <em>Id. </em>at 39. Specifically, the court found that whether there is a reasonable possibility the result of the trial would have been different hinged on whether Ooveda’s hypothetical testimony would have bolstered Forbes’s testimony and created a reasonable doubt as to Jones’s guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 35. The court was “not persuaded of this probability given the testimony of the other State’s witnesses who testified that the Defendant Jones first introduced the knife.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). As to Hamilton, the court concluded that Hamilton was confused about when Jones wielded the knife and therefore would not have helped counsel’s self-defense theory. The court also noted that “Hamilton mixed up the parties, having the Defendant chased by the younger man, rather than as the majority of witnesses testified.” <em>Id. </em>at 36 (Finding of Fact (B)(2)).

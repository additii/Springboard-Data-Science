The chapter contains no language expressly supporting or prohibiting extraterritorial application of the exemption to property located outside of Washington. The statutes defining “homestead” (RCW 6.13.010, .020), creating the homestead exemption (RCW 6.13.030), and limiting its application (RCW 6.13.080) do not expressly address this issue.

If we were to interpret the homestead exemption to apply to real property located outside of Washington, a consistent reading would also require the same actions to be taken by out-of-state courts and agencies. It is unlikely the legislature intended such extraterritorial application of these procedures, however, because the State lacks the authority to direct actions and procedures of foreign courts or foreign agencies. Nor can the procedural aspects of the law be jettisoned. The homestead exemption law operates through its statutory procedures that direct courts and agencies. For this reason, the homestead exemption law cannot apply to real property located outside of Washington without necessarily triggering its procedural requirements.

Cons. Stat. Ann. § 8124 (exempting particular property from execution but not including homesteads). In stark contrast, several states allow exemptions for the value of the <em>entire </em>homestead, with some acreage limitations, unlike Washington, which has a statutory maximum value of $125,000. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20561.2" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="Iowa Code § 561.2">Iowa Code § 561.2</a>; Fla.

This interpretation, which the debtors urge in their brief, seems consistent with the liberal, prodebtor construction that federal courts apply to exemptions under § 522. <em>See, e.g., In re Arrol, </em><a href="/f3d/170/0934-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="170 F.3d 934" data-case-ids="11589009,11636508" data-case-paths="/f3d/170/0934-01,/br/231/0934-01">170 F.3d 934</a>, 937 (9th Cir. 1999) (“[W]e are mindful of the strong policy underlying both California law and federal bankruptcy law to interpret exemption statutes liberally in favor of the debtor.”); <em>In re Glass, </em><a href="/br/164/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="164 B.R. 759" data-case-ids="6115259" data-case-paths="/br/164/0759-01">164 B.R. 759</a>, 764 (B.A.R 9th Cir. 1994) (recognizing “that the availability of exemptions is to be liberally construed in favor of the debtor”).</p>

The bankruptcy court, which handles exemptions arising under § 522 on a daily basis, is better positioned than this court to discern Congress’s intent in § 522. Regardless, construing a federal statute is not a matter of Washington state or local law, and RCW 2.60.020 therefore does not give us the authority to answer this certified question.</p>
    <p id="b970-4" data-blocks='[["BL_970.5",970,[186,736,1250,1140]]]'>¶34 To the extent our own legislature’s intent is relevant here — and for the reasons stated above, I do not believe it is — the legislative intent behind Washington’s homestead act supports permitting a federal bankruptcy court to apply our homestead exemption to property owned by Washingtonians wherever that property is located. As the majority correctly recognizes, the homestead act is a remedial statute that is entitled to liberal construction. Majority at 925, 929. The majority further acknowledges the homestead act “contains no language expressly supporting or prohibiting extraterritorial application of the exemption to property located outside of Washington.” <em>Id. </em>at 926. The plain language of the homestead act thus does not preclude a Washingtonian from exempting a homestead that is located in another state. Nevertheless, the majority concludes that our legislature did not intend for our homestead exemption to be applied to property physically located outside Washington because chapter 6.13 RCW contains provisions specifying that Washington state agencies and courts would be responsible for enforcement. <em>Id. </em>at 926-29 (citing RCW 6.13.040(2)-(4), .050, .090, .130, .150, .160, .190, .240).</p>

At most, the statutes cited by the majority merely recognize that <em>our own </em>courts and other state institutions lack the authority to apply Washington law extraterritorially. They say nothing about whether a federal court — a court not subject to the same geographic and jurisdictional restrictions as our own <a id="p935" href="#p935" data-label="935" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*935</a>courts — has the power to do so.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">5</a> Because we must construe the homestead act libérally, I do not believe its references to local courts and agencies can be construed as limiting the manner in which the exemption may be applied by a federal bankruptcy court.</p>
    <p id="b971-4" data-blocks='[["BL_971.5",971,[153,629,1250,640]]]'>¶36 In any case, our own legislature’s intent is not relevant to whether § 522 grants federal bankruptcy courts the authority to apply Washington’s homestead exemption to a Washingtonian’s homestead in Alaska. If the bankruptcy court determines that Congress did not intend to incorporate certain state law restrictions into the § 522 exemption scheme, then it may apply our homestead exemption to the disputed property in this case. If it reaches the opposite conclusion, it may reject the debtors’ attempt to claim an exemption on their Alaska property. Either way, the question ultimately turns on an interpretation of a federal statute, not on an interpretation of Washington law.</p>

Given that Congress did not pass the first uniform federal bankruptcy law until 1898 and did not create the current federal bankruptcy exemption scheme until 1978, our legislature could not possibly have had modern federal bankruptcy law in mind when it created the homestead exemption. It would be anachronistic, then, to look to the legislative intent behind the statutes the majority cites when considering how our homestead exemption applies in federal bankruptcy.</p>

A summons was issued in each case, and on September 29, 1921, a separate judgment was rendered in each case for the amount sued for. The judgment in the first case was for $60 for one heifer; that in the second case was for $60 for another heifer, and the judgments in the four other cases were for different amounts aggregating $180.</p>

The testimony on the part of appellees was to the effect that the animals were found lying along the track, and one witness stated that the last animal killed was lying 225 feet from the first animal killed. The other animals were lying between. Other witnesses .for appellees placed the animals nearer together than we have stated, but none of them place the entire distance at more than 225 feet, and we state the testimony most favorably to appellees.

It results from this principle, and the rule is fully established, that an entire claim arising either upon a contract or from a wrong cannot be divided and made the subject of several suits; and if several suits be brought for different parts of such a claim, the pendency of the first may be pleaded in abatement of the others, and a judgment upon the merits of either will be available as a bar in the others.”</p>

The facts recited in the opinion of the court were that the colt was first struck and killed, and then the mare was struck and injured at a point thirty rods from where the colt was struck. The court said there was a difference of time and locality, and that this difference made and constituted separate and distinct causes of action. The court stated the fact that the killing of the colt might have been prevented by the exercise of ordinary care, while the injury of the mare must have been the result of gross negligence. The court, however, recognized and stated the principle which controls here, for it was there said: “When two horses are killed by the cars of a railroad company at the same time, or when different chattels are taken by one trespass, or converted by one person at the same time, but one recovery can be had. This rule applies in all such cases where the tort, trespass, or conversion consists of one entire and undivided act.”</p>

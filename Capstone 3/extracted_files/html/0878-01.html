It directs the judge to consider if the presump<a id="p887" href="#p887" data-label="887" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*887</a>tive sentence “is clearly excessive in light of the purpose of this chapter, <em>as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.” </em>RCW 9.94A-.535(l)(g) (emphasis added). RCW 9.94A.010 lists seven policy goals the legislature intends the SRA to advance:</p>

    <p id="b929-12" data-blocks='[["BL_929.12",929,[625,1570,224,36]]]'>Conclusion</p>
    <p id="b929-13" data-blocks='[["BL_929.13",929,[109,1660,1250,583]]]'>¶18 We hold RCW 9.94A.535(l)(g) allows an exceptional sentence for multiple current serious violent offenses scored under RCW 9.94A.589(l)(b) that is achieved by departing downward from the standard ranges for the offenses and/or by running sentences concurrently. We reverse the Court of Appeals and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion. We take no position on whether Graham’s sentence is “clearly excessive” under .535(l)(g) or on the virtues of his 25-year sentence recommendation, as those issues are properly left for the sentencing judge.</p>
    <p id="b929-14" data-blocks='[["BL_929.14",929,[109,2300,1247,99]]]'>Madsen, C.J., and C. Johnson, Owens, Fairhurst, Stephens, Wiggins, González, and Gordon McCloud, JJ., concur.</p>

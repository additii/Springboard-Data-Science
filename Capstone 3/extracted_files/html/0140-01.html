On appeal to the circuit court, the proceedings in the county court in 1925 were offered in evidence and also the testimony of the present county judge and clerk regarding the status of the turnback funds, the number of miles of county roads and the condition of the roads, from which it appeared that, if the $5,000 per annum .were paid from the turnback fund, there would not be sufficient funds from that and other sources to maintain the county roads in a usable condition. The county judge testified from the facts within his own knowledge and the information he had received that he had concluded that it was not for the best interest of the county and the various road districts thereof that payment be made under the order of June 1,1925.</p>

It is true that the order or contract does not specify the number of payments to be made, but it is clear that such annual payments are to continue during the life of the bonds and no longer. The final payment of the county is necessarily restricted to the final pay<a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>ment of the bonds. It is not to be supposed, as suggested, that the' bridge commissioners would unduly extend the payment of the bonds in order to continue indefinitely the county’s contribution to the enterprise. It is common business knowledge that, in order to float a large bond issue, the payment thereof must be within a reasonable time.</p>
    <p id="b161-2" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[150,680,1216,1615]]]'>(2) The order or contract, on its face, provides "that the annual appropriation for a contribution to the enterprise shall be paid out of the special road fund, or what both appellant and appellee treat as the gasoline turn-back fund, by the State to the county. It is argued that, at the time the order or contract was made, the gasoline turnback fund could not be used in building bridges. The special acts of the Legislature relating to the use to be. made of the turnback fund provided that it may be used “for constructing and maintaining roads” — “for use on county roads” — and “for aid of county highway fund.” See act No. 5, § 21, Special Acts of 1923; act No. 147 of Acts 1925; acts Nos. 11 and 18 of Acts of 1927. The provisions quoted above from the special acts referred to are broad enough to include building and maintaining bridges, which are necessary integral parts of highways. The mere fact that building and maintaining bridges is specially mentioned in act No. 63 of the Acts of 1931, relative to the use of turnback fund, does not mean, as argued, that a different Legislature in passing the prior acts intended to prevent the use of the turnback fund in building and maintaining bridges. Had all the acts been enacted at the same session of the Legislature, there would be some force in appellant’s argument that special reference made to the use of the fund for building and ■maintaining bridges in the last act and not in the prior acts evidenced an. intention that such use thereof was not intended by the Legislature in the prior acts. Not so when the several acts were enacted at different times by different Legislatures. Under these circumstances, the intention of each act would and must depend largely on the breadth and scope of the language used.</p>

The record does <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>not reflect that any injury resulted from the contract.

The final payment of the county is necessarily restricted to the final payment of the bonds.” In order to find warrant for this statement, the court must go .beyond the language of the judgment and indulge in surmise and speculation. This, I submit, is an improper way to interpret the language of a judgment or to test its validity. Continuing, the court says: “It is not to be supposed, as suggested, that the bridge commissioners would unduly extend the payment of the bonds in order to continue indefinitely the <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>county’s contribution to the enterprise. It is common business knowledge that in order to float a large bond issue the payment thereof must be within a reasonable time. ’ ’ It is, perhaps, true that the bridge commissioners would not intentionally extend the payment of the bonds, and that the maturities of the bonds will fall due within a reasonable time, but it does not follow by any means that the payment will not be unduly extended beyond the maturity, and may be for a long time thereafter, from causes arising which could not have been reasonably foreseen or prevented. It is also “common business knowledge,” which has been sharpened and made alert by recent events, that bonds which were expected to be paid at a certain time may, unhappily, never be paid or their payment extended to a far distant day. Therefore, if the judgment means what it says, it is entirely possible that the $5,000 per annum payment may be indeed perpetual. I repeat that the order appears to me to violate the first requisite of a valid judgment; that it must be certain in the amount which must be paid.</p>
    <p id="b163-2" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[150,1355,1204,970]]]'>The special road fund named in the judgment was a gift from the State to the county, and the former had the right to, and did, prescribe and limit its use. That prescription and limitation is clear and explicit. The controlling law at the time the county court rendered its judgment is to be found in § 21 of act No. 5 of the Extraordinary Session of 1923, and thus speaks: “The funds thus paid into the county highway improvement fund shall be by the county court expended upon the public highways of said county, and it shall be the duty of the county court to fairly and equitably apportion the funds so paid into the county highway improvement fund at the option of the court among the various road districts and road improvement districts or road districts only -in said county for the purpose of constructing and maintaining the road, whether hard surface or earth road, and such apportionment shall be made by the county court after taking in consideration the relative importance of the roads of the county.”</p>

In all of the acts dealing with State aid to the counties for the improvement of highways, prior to act 63 of the Acts of 1931, State aid was limited to the improvement of county roads. In the last-named act, which is not retroactive and therefore cannot affect previous orders made with respect to the turnback fund, the power is given county courts to expend a part of the fund for the payment of bridges built by bridge districts, the amount to be paid the bridge districts to be determined by the county court or judge thereof. That act, however, as we have seen, relates only to the disposition of the turnback fund from and after the passage of that act.</p>

This is a bridge one and a half miles long erected at a cost of $600,000 across one of the principal rivers of the State and as a part of one of its main highways, and to say, as does the court, that “the provisions above (referring to the acts of the Legislature) are broad enough to include building and maintaining bridges which are necessary parts of the highways” is to totally ignore the character of the bridge under consideration which, in no sense, is a county bridge and the expenditure from the turnback fund thereon was wholly unauthorized.</p>

It seems to me that much injury will result. It is to be presumed that the vast majority of the county’s population resides on or near the county roads, and, if these become impassable, -as it is the opinion of the county officers they will, but little good will result to the people from the magnificent-bridge and the State’s highway and the enforcement of the order of the county court will, in the end, prove disastrous to the county.</p>

We simply decide the contest for the nomination, and, under the law, if a person is given a certificate of nomination, his name placed on the ticket, and he is elected, we have the jurisdiction to decide whether he was or was not entitled to the nomination, and if the court decides that he was not, and there has already been an election, the judgment of the court operates as an ouster. That is, it decides that his election was void because of a violation of the Primary Election Law.</p>

W. 1</a>, in which the validity of the three-mill road tax levied by Sevier County for the years 1922 and 1923 was upheld. In that case, as shown by the record herein, the railroad company, by suit on April 10, 1923, enjoined the collection of the road taxes for the year 1922, and, by an amendment filed on April 4, 1924, the injunction was made to include the road taxes for 1923. Upon the hearing on April 28, 1923', the injunction was made permanent, but, on appeal to this court, the decree was reversed and the complaint dismissed. Thereupon the appellee, the present tax collector, who had succeeded the collector at the time of the other suit, demanded payment of the amount of the road taxes due, with a 25 per cent, penalty and interest.</p>
    <p id="b866-5" data-blocks='[["BL_866.7",866,[291,1342,1200,605]]]'>The amount of the road taxes only was paid to the collector by the railroad companies., the present appellants, under a stipulation that such payment should not affect the rights of either party as to interest and penalty. The appellants herein then enjoined the collection of the penalties for said years. The appellee demurred to the complaint, and moved for a judgment on the bond. There was a hearing, the appellee still insisting upon his demurrer. The court sustained it, and rendered judgment for the collector for the amount of the penalty, denying interest on either taxes or penalty, or on both, and from this judgment the appeal is prosecuted.</p>

The failure to pay the taxes in the time allowed therefor is what constitutes them delinquent and fixes the liability for the penalty.</p>

Digest) is required to be added by the county clerk upon all taxes on real estate returned delinquent, which is to be collected in the manner provided for the collection of delinquent taxes, we can see no good reason why this penalty should not attach without the filing of a delinquent list, since the law fixes the amount of the penalty, and since it could not be collected in any event by the sale of the railroad property by the collector, as <a id="p850" href="#p850" data-label="850" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*850</a>the lands of individual delinquent taxpayers are sold. In other words, the law fixes the penalty for the failure to pay the taxes within the time allowed by law, and the collection of such delinquent taxes can only he made through the courts in the manner provided therefor. The report and filing of a delinquent list by the collector and the charging of the 25 per cent, penalty thereon against such property by the county clerk is not a condition precedent to the collection of such penalty, in the case of delinquent taxes on railroads.</p>

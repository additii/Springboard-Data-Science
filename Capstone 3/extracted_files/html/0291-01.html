The amounts due from Miller were proved beyond dispute, as hereinbefore stated, and it was also proved that the funds collected by Miller from the city and districts were jointly deposited in bank in his name as collector. It was impossible to show from what particular source these funds came further than that they were collections for the benefit of the city and the districts. There is no way, from the testimony, to separate the funds, and, if being shown to be a joint fund, it can only be divided <em>pro rata </em>in accordance with the .amounts due by Miller to each.</p>

The last mentioned statute was again amended by the act of February 11, 1897 (Acts of 1897, p. 23) reenacting the old statute to the effect that the collector and treasurer of local improvement districts should be appointed by the board of improvement, but providing that the cities of Little Rock and Pine 'Bluff should have the power, by ordinance, to make the city collector <em>ex-officio </em>collector of improvement districts.

If the repeal or amendment has been accomplished, it must be by implication only, and such repeals are not favored. That principle is elemental and needs no citation of authorities to -support it. This court has often announced that rule of construction. There is no reference made in this statute to the act of 1897, but, on the contrary, the section under consideration expressly refers to another statute, <em>viz., </em>§ 5337 of Sandels <em>&amp; </em>Hill’ Digest, which relates merely to the method of certifying the assessments by the city clerk. At the time of the enactment of § 5-337, Sandels &amp; Hill’s Digest, the statute provided that assessments for local improvements should be according to valuation as appraised for general taxation purposes, and that section provided that, immediately after the passage of the ordinance authorizing the improvement, the city clerk, should procure, at the expense of the district, a copy of the last assessment made by the county assessor and deliver the same to the collector of the improvement district, with his warrant attached, directing the collection of the assessments. The manifest purpose of the amendment of § 5337 was to give further time for the certification of the list of assessments, giving forty days after the passage of the ordinance, and also providing that there should be certified a list of assessments as appraised by the assessors of the district, instead of a list of valuation made to the county assessor as required under the former statute. That part of the section which prescribes the form of the certificate was a mere formula and nothing more, and it cannot be presumed that the lawmakers intended in this incidental way to repeal or amend an important feature of the former statute. If such had been the intention, the lawmakers would doubtless have adopted more direct language expressing that intention. As an indication that such a change was not in the minds of the framers of the statute in prescribing the formula for certifying the assessments, it was pro<a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>vided that the warrant should be directed to the collector of the city or town, whereas there is no such office as collector of an unincorporated town. The statute does not provide for any such office, and that office pertains only to cities. If the statute in question is construed to repeal the former statute, then there is no provision at all for a collector for local improvement districts in incorporated towns.</p>

    <p id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[319,1075,1202,859]]]'>We hold, in accordance with this view, that the act of 1897 (‘Crawford &amp; Moses’.

Having received the funds, however, for the benefit of the improvement districts, he became, in fact, a bailee, and was subject to prosecution for embezzlement, as we announced in the former opinion in the criminal case against Miller, but the sureties on his official bond are not liable for the defalcation, for the reason, as before stated, that Miller was not, in law, the authorized collector of the districts.</p>
    <p id="b320-5" data-blocks='[["BL_320.6",320,[317,1948,1201,396]]]'>It follows therefore that the decree was wrong in awarding any sum to the0 improvement districts, but the bond protects the city of North Little Bock to the extent of Miller’s defalcation of said funds.

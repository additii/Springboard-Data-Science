An agency violates a requestor’s right to receive a response when it withholds or redacts public records without articulating a specific applicable exemption and providing a “brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld.” RCW 42.56.210(3). We are asked to decide whether the city of Lakewood’s explanation for redacting driver’s license numbers from records produced for David Koenig was inadequate and, if so, whether Koenig is entitled to attorney fees.

I do not find this correct-explanation requirement in the statute, and I do not believe that we should create one. Instead, if the agency has failed to identify a record at all or has failed to either release a record or give its reason for withholding, whether correct or incorrect, then attorney fees may be warranted. But where the agency has identified the records and given its reason for redacting or withholding the record, no attorney fees are independently warranted. Therefore, I dissent.</p>

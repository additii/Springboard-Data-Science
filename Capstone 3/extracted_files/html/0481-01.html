The lawsuit stems from Gate Gourmet’s employee meal policy, which bars employees from bringing in their own food for lunch (for security reasons), leaving only employer-provided food for the employees to eat. According to the plaintiffs, the policy forces them to work without food or eat food that violates their religious beliefs. The trial court dismissed the lawsuit in its entirety, finding that the WLAD contains no requirement that employers make reasonable accommodations for their employees’ religious practices. We granted direct review and now reverse.</p>

Due to security concerns, the employees can neither bring food with them to work nor leave the premises to obtain food during their 30-minute lunch break. Instead, Gate Gourmet provides meals for employees to consume during their break. These meals ostensibly consist of one vegetarian and one meat-based main dish. The employees allege, however, that Gate Gourmet uses animal by-products in the “vegetarian” option. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 14. They also allege that they informed Gate Gourmet that their various religious beliefs prohibited them from eating the beef-pork meatballs the company served, that Gate Gourmet responded by temporarily switching to turkey meatballs, that the company later switched back to the beef-pork mixture without notifying the employees, and that it now refuses to alter the employee meals. Finally, the complaint alleges harm. It claims that the employees “caused the plaintiffs ... harm by deliberately refusing to accommodate their religious and moral beliefs.” <em>Id. </em>In particular, the complaint alleges that Gate Gourmet’s alleged deception caused “putative class members [to] unknowingly eat[ ] food forbidden by their beliefs,” CP at 19, and that class members “have faced the choice of eating food forbidden by their sincerely held beliefs or not eating, have suffered offensive touching due to their contact with food prohibited by their beliefs, and have suffered distress as a result.” CP at 22.</p>

CP at 21. This allegation is based on two distinct theories: (1) that Gate Gourmet’s meal policy constituted a failure to reasonably accommodate the employees’ religious practices and (2) that the meal policy has a disparate impact on employees who adhere to certain religions.

    <p id="b572-5" data-blocks='[["BL_572.5",572,[223,859,1248,483]]]'>¶46 The legislature has given authority to the HRC, not this court, to create specific rules to effect its general intent. RCW 49.60.110 (“The commission shall formulate policies to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.”), .120(3) (stating that the HRC has the power “[t]o adopt, amend, and rescind suitable rules to carry out the provisions of this chapter”). The HRC has exercised this authority, most notably when it promulgated rules requiring accommodation for persons with disabilities.</p>

Judicial law making of the type engaged in by the majority, alternately, gives no notice to parties and provides no opportunity for public input to help vet the consequences. Instead, the majority imposes a new cause of action and applies it to Gate Gourmet without any prior notice of how it might have conformed its behavior to the law. The HRC has so far declined to exercise their legislative grant of power and has neither recognized nor provided rules establishing an accommodation cause of action as it did in the context of disability discrimination. Agencies are experts in their fields and have the time, resources, and knowledge to make the most informed decisions. Additionally, rule making provides an important opportunity to those most affected to offer critical input. This court should not announce new regulations where the HRC has chosen not to.</p>

      <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>¶48 The majority justifies its decision to bypass the HRC by contending that HRC regulations merely interpret preexisting WLAD law rather than create new law. Majority at 495. The majority cites <em>Holland v. Boeing Co., </em><a href="/wash-2d/90/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="185" data-cite="90 Wash. 2d 384" data-case-ids="1104360" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/90/0384-01">90 Wn.2d 384</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=583%20P.2d%20621" class="citation" data-index="186" data-cite="583 P.2d 621">583 P.2d 621</a> (1978), for this proposition, reasoning that in <em>Holland </em>the court found an accommodation action in the disability context “inherent” in the WLAD itself. Majority at 495. Though this court in <em>Holland </em>did recognize the compatibility of a disability accommodation claim with the governing policy of WLAD, this court nowhere said such a disability cause of action was “inherent” and preexisting in the WLAD. <em>Holland, </em>90 Wn.2d at 388-89. In fact, <em>Holland </em>gave “great weight” to an existing administrative regulation that had created an accommodation cause of action for disability discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 389 (“The regulation, as the construction of the statute by those whose duty it is to administer its terms, is entitled to be given great weight.”). Moreover, <em>Holland </em>emphasized the unique difficulties faced by handicapped individuals in the workplace and even explicitly distinguished between religious and disability discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 388 (explaining that, in contrast to other forms of discrimination, “different treatment may eliminate discrimination against the handicapped and open the door to employment opportunities”). Because Congress had also recognized the exceptional challenges faced by disabled employees by providing a cause of action separate from Title VII, this court declined to use the Title VII standard for measuring an unfair employment practice in the employment context. <em>Id. </em>at 390 (“Congress recognized, as do we, that discrimination on the basis of handicap is different in many respects from other types of employment discrimination.”). Though collateral to the court’s decision to imply a cause of action for accommodation of disability, the distinction shows the court’s recognition of disability discrimination and religious discrimination as two different bodies of law. The majority’s reliance on <em>Holland </em>is misplaced.</p>

      <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>¶49 Instead, this court should heed the teaching of <em>Hegwine v. Longview Fibre Co., </em><a href="/wash-2d/162/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="187" data-cite="162 Wash. 2d 340" data-case-ids="3696372" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/162/0340-01">162 Wn.2d 340</a>, 349-52, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20P.3d%20688" class="citation" data-index="188" data-cite="172 P.3d 688">172 P.3d 688</a> (2007), where we declined to imply an accommodation claim for sex discrimination. In <em>Hegwine </em>a woman challenged an employer’s refusal to hire her because she was pregnant, reasoning that the employer was liable for sex discrimination under the WLAD. <em>Id. </em>at 345-48. We noted the legislature’s silence and reasoned that “[i]t is not for this court to impose such an accommodation analysis where the legislature has not seen fit to do so.” <em>Id. </em>at 352. The majority contends that <em>Hegwine </em>is “inapposite” based on a “straightforward application of the HRC’s interpretive guidelines.” Majority at 500 n.26. Though the <em>Hegwine </em>court did use HRC guidelines to determine that pregnancy fell within the realm of sex rather than disability discrimination, the court went on to hold that the failure to accommodate is not actionable as sex discrimination and declined to imply a cause of action. Whether or not the parties focused on this point is irrelevant; this court reached the issue and chose not to imply an accommodation action. <em>Hegwine </em>is our most recent and relevant case addressing whether to imply a failure to accommodate cause of action into the WLAD, and its reasoning is on point here.</p>

The majority reasons that because we have implied a disparate impact cause of action into the WLAD, we can imply a similar religious accommodation cause of action. Majority at 498-501. Contrary to the majority’s contention, I do find a “logical reason” to recognize disparate impact but not accommodation claims in the WLAD. <em>Id. </em>at 500. Unlike religious accommodation, disparate impact is not a “cause of action” but is merely an alternate method of proving discrimination under RCW 49.60.180(1). An employee can prove discrimination by showing actual discriminatory intent or by showing a disparate impact in the absence of intent. A typical dis<a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>crimination claim, whether proved through treatment or impact, promotes access to employment opportunities for all. Accommodation claims require that the employer not just refrain from discrimination in hiring, firing, and promotion decisions but rather reasonably accommodate employees’ demands for alterations in employment conditions when grounded in bona fide religious belief. The majority cites <em>Fahn v. Cowlitz County, </em><a href="/wash-2d/93/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="189" data-cite="93 Wash. 2d 368" data-case-ids="1167738" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/93/0368-01">93 Wn.2d 368</a>, 378, <a href="/citations/?q=610%20P.2d%20857" class="citation" data-index="190" data-cite="610 P.2d 857">610 P.2d 857</a> (1980), to support its proposition that disparate impact is its own cause of action, yet <em>Fahn </em>itself refers to disparate impact and disparate treatment as two “forms” of discrimination. Our disparate impact jurisprudence provides no support for implying an accommodation cause of action into the WLAD.</p>

In 1972, Congress created a cause of action for religious accommodation by amending the definition of “religion” in Title VII. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j). The majority credits the employees’ argument that “Title VII had always imposed a reasonable accommodation duty on the employer and that the 1972 amendment clarified (rather than expanded) that implicit duty ... to reasonably accommodate employees’ religious practices.” Majority at 496. The majority contends that the WLAD must likewise contain an implicit religious accommodation cause of action. But the majority overlooks a crucial fact. Shortly after Congress enacted Title VII, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) promulgated a rule establishing a religious accommodation cause of action. The EEOC promulgated this rule using their legislatively granted rule making authority to apply the legislative intent of Title VII. So although the Court did recognize an accommodation cause of action before Congress explicitly amended Title VII in 1972, this long stand<a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>ing recognition was supported by a rule crafted by an agency that Congress had granted specific authority to interpret and apply the statute at issue. As addressed above, the HRC, though cloaked with the same authority as the EEOC, never promulgated a rule establishing a religious accommodation cause of action. Unlike the United States Supreme Court, this court has no support, legislative or administrative, for finding an implicit religious accommodation action in the WLAD.</p>
    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[226,855,1254,1175]]]'>¶52 Even if I agreed with the majority’s decision to imply an accommodation cause of action, I strongly disagree with its application of such a cause of action to these facts. By creating a new accommodation cause of action without any legislative or administrative guidance, this court’s only choice is to create a cause of action identical to the federal Title VII accommodation claim. The majority holds that our new accommodation claim will track the federal equivalent but misapplies the prima facie elements. Federal law requires the existence of a cognizable employment harm to sustain a valid accommodation claim. To state a prima facie case of failure to accommodate under Title VII, the employee must show (1) the employee holds a bona fide religious belief, (2) the employee informed the employer of that belief, and (3) the employee was <em>disciplined </em>for failing to comply with the conflicting employer policy. 2 Charles A. Sullivan et al., Employment Discrimination: Law and Practice 551 (3d ed. 2002). Indeed, this court in <em>Hiatt v. Walker Chevrolet Co., </em><a href="/wash-2d/120/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="191" data-cite="120 Wash. 2d 57" data-case-ids="1368169" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/120/0057-01">120 Wn.2d 57</a>, 64-65, <a href="/citations/?q=837%20P.2d%20618" class="citation" data-index="192" data-cite="837 P.2d 618">837 P.2d 618</a> (1992), required <em>actual discharge </em>of the employee in order to satisfy the third prong of a prima facie Title VII accommodation claim.</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.6",576,[225,2063,1249,314]],["BL_577.1",577,[143,350,1250,317]]]'>¶53 Kumar fails to allege discharge or discipline. The Gate Gourmet employees may have held bona fide religious beliefs and did notify their employer of those beliefs, but they did not suffer any sort of punishment, reprimand, threat of punishment, or discharge based on these beliefs. The prima facie requirement of an adverse employment <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>action serves an important purpose in accommodation claims. Private employers are under no <em>constitutional </em>duty to accommodate the religious beliefs of employees, and the requirement of an adverse employment consequence properly limits the statutory accommodation remedy to the most serious cases of employer discrimination.</p>
    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[140,691,1251,856]]]'>¶54 Though some cases suggest that actual discharge is not always required, even those cases recognize that there must at the very least be an “implicit threat” of adverse employment consequences or the existence of constructive discharge. <em>E.g., Berry v.

In a footnote, the majority contends that an “employee need not be at immediate risk of actual firing or demotion to demonstrate threatened or actual discriminatory treatment.” Majority at 502 n.30. Even following the cases the majority cites, the facts here do not support an adequate prima facie case.</p>

Under any reasonable definition of a prima facie case, Kumar failed to allege the requisite employment harm.

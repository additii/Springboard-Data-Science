When Officer Erik Olson stopped and seized Antoine Brock, he had Brock <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>remove the backpack he was wearing and placed it where Brock could not readily access it. After a period of questioning, the officer arrested Brock and then searched the backpack.

The park was closed and had been since 11:30 p.m. As he approached the men’s room, the officer could see a person’s legs inside the stall. Officer Olson waited approximately 10 minutes before Brock emerged wearing baggy clothing and carrying a backpack.</p>

Because Brock had been cooperative, Olson did not use handcuffs and instructed Brock just to remain near the curb while he returned to his truck to search the backpack for identification.

He also found a Department of Corrections (DOC) inmate identification card displaying Brock’s photograph and identifying him as Antoine L. Brock. Olson walked back over to Brock, handcuffed him, and put him in the back of his patrol truck. Olson estimated that the entire encounter, from the time of the initial contact to the time he handcuffed Brock, was about 10 minutes.</p>

Once Washington State Patrol confirmed the warrant, Olson had no choice but to take Brock to jail. Before doing so, Olson emptied the contents of the backpack in what he considered an inventory search prior to taking Brock to jail for booking. Olson explained that for safety <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>reasons, he could not bring the backpack to the jail without first performing a search of the arrestee’s personal effects for weapons or explosives.

A valid search of the latter requires justification grounded in either officer safety or evidence preservation— there must be some articulable concern that the arrestee can access the item in order to draw a weapon or destroy evidence. <em>Byrd, </em>178 Wn.2d at 617 (citing <em>Chimel v.

The former search does not; in analyzing the search of an arrestee, we utilize the United States Supreme Court’s rationale from the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution that “ ‘a search may be made of the <em>person </em>of the arrestee by virtue of the lawful arrest.’” <em>Byrd, </em>178 Wn.2d at 617 (quoting <em>United States v.

This is known as the “time of arrest” rule. We have previously applied this rule in cases involving an arrestee who was holding the personal item at the precise moment of arrest. But here, because Brock was separated from his backpack several minutes prior to arrest, the issue involves the scope of “immediately preceding arrest.”</p>

      <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>¶13 In <em>Byrd, </em>we analyzed this “time of arrest” distinction between items that are part of the arrestee’s “person” and items merely within the arrestee’s immediate control. <em>Byrd </em>involved the validity of a warrantless search of a car passenger’s purse. At the time of arrest, Byrd held the purse in her lap, but when ordered to step out of the car, she asked to leave the purse in the car. The officers refused and seized her purse as part of the arrest. The purse was removed and searched separate from her person. We recognized that her physical distance from the bag dispelled any practical concerns that she could have reached the purse to draw a weapon or destroy evidence, but we upheld the search as a search of her “person.” Unlike items in the immediately surrounding area, the officer does not need to articulate any objective safety or evidence preservation concerns before validly searching the item. We said that the officer’s authority to search the purse flowed “from the authority of [the] custodial arrest itself.” <em>Byrd, </em>178 Wn.2d at 618 (citing <em>Robinson, </em><a href="/us/414/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="414 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="11715586" data-case-paths="/us/414/0218-01">414 U.S. at 232</a>). This authority satisfies article I, section 7’s requirement that the incursions into private affairs be supported by “‘authority of law.’” <em>Byrd, </em>178 Wn.2d at 618 (quoting Wash. Const. art. I, § 7). The arrest provides the constitutional authority of law justifying the search.</p>

    <blockquote id="b197-5" data-blocks='[["BL_197.5",197,[247,2004,1206,290]]]'>The time of arrest rule reflects the practical reality that a search of the arrestee’s “person” to remove weapons and secure evidence must include more than his literal person. . . .

The officer returned to the patrol car, radioed in that she had custody of Smith, and searched the fanny pack approximately 9 to 17 minutes after the arrest.

In this case, the Court of Appeals found the difference between a few minutes and approximately 10 minutes dispositive.

Although we must draw these exceptions to the warrant requirement narrowly, we do not draw them arbitrarily; the exception must track its underlying justification. Because the search incident to arrest rule recognizes the practicalities of an officer having to secure and transport personal items as part of the arrestee’s person, we draw the line of “immediately preceding” with that focus. The proper inquiry is whether possession so immediately precedes arrest that the item is still functionally a part of the arrestee’s person. Put simply, personal items that will go to jail with the arrestee are considered in the arrestee’s “possession” and are within the scope of the officer’s authority to search.</p>

Brock wore the backpack at the very moment he was stopped by Officer Olson. The arrest process began the moment Officer Olson told Brock that although he was not under arrest, he was also not free to leave. The officer himself removed the backpack from Brock as a part of his investigation. And, having no other place to safely stow it, Brock would have to bring the backpack along with him into custody. Once the arrest process had begun, the passage of time prior to the arrest did not render it any less a part of Brock’s arrested person.</p>

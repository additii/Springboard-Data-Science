This argument fails for three reasons. First, legal errors alone do not warrant reassignment. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em><a href="/us/510/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="510 U.S. 540" data-case-ids="235096" data-case-paths="/us/510/0540-01">510 U.S. 540</a>, 555, <a href="/us/510/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="510 U.S. 540" data-case-ids="235096" data-case-paths="/us/510/0540-01">114 S.

Second (and relatedly), our decision today leaves no discretion in the hands of the trial court as to the <em>Alleynel Apprendi </em>issue appealed. Thus, as to that issue, there is simply no basis for the State’s assertion that Judge Ramsdell will have trouble “putting aside [his] strongly held views.” Opening Br. of Pet’r at 41.

Moreover, the State did not develop the theory that <em>Siers </em>was the dispositive case until it filed its motion for reconsideration in the trial court. Before it filed that motion, the State never treated <em>Siers </em>as controlling.

The evidence presented to the court below is not in dispute, and the facts may be thus stated: Jesse Hardee, the husband of the appellee, became a member of the appellant society in 1909 and secured a certificate of insurance for $2,000. He was in good standing on June 13, 1929, when, pursuant to an application he had made on May 28 preceding, his certificate of insurance was canceled by agreement and a new one issued. In his written application for exchange of certificate, he applied for an ordinary life certificate in the sum of $2,000 in lieu of his certificate then in being. The application contained, among others, these provisions: ‘ ‘ The new certificate is to become effective on thé first day of June, 1929, and to bear the date of June 1, 1923, and age of 45.</p>

    <p id="b564-4" data-blocks='[["BL_564.4",564,[310,515,1208,1680]]]'>Beginning with the month of June, 1929, down to and including the month of September, 1931, the insured paid each monthly installment when due, amounting to a total of 28 monthly payments. He did not pay the installment falling due in the month of October, 1931, or any other installment thereafter, and died on February 24, 1933, in arrears to the society for sixteen monthly premiums the total amount of which, with accrued interest, was $89.82. At the time of the exchange of policies the insured Avas 51 years old, but because of the fact that under his first certificate he Avas due a certain amount of accumulated reserves, the rate charged him in the ucav policy was as of the age of 45 years, and the nonforfeiture values were to be computed as if the certificate had been issued on June 1, 1923, and, after the accumulated reserves had been used for the purposes last stated, there remained a cash reserve of $186.24, Avhieh Avas credited to the new certificate as reserve on June 1, 1929, the date of its issuance. At the end of the policy year, June 1, 1931, the cash and loan value of the certificate amounted to $268.38, up to which time the monthly payments had been regularly made down to and including the month of September following. Hence it appears, and this is admitted, that there was a cash reserve on the old policy which was credited on the neAV on June 1,1929, in a sufficient sum with the 28 monthly payments made on the latter to carry it well beyond the date of the death of the insured, and which it was the duty of the society to apply to the payment of monthly premiums and thus prevent a forfeiture of the policy. <em>Pfeiffer </em>v. <em>Mo.

We do not agree to this interpretation of the waiver, first, because under the old certificate there was sufficient cash reserve to justify the writing of the insured as of the age of 45 years, and any waiver of the right to the benefit of the balance of the cash reserve remaining would be without consideration. <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Reliance Life Ins.

That this waiver was required and executed simply because the old certificate was lost is made clearer by the agreement in it that the same should be canceled, and that it should be forwarded to the home office of the society if it should again come into the possession of the insured; and that the right to the cash •reserve was not waived was clearly shown by the fact <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>that the society, on the date of the new certificate, credited snch reserve to it.

What we have said heretofore sufficiently disposes of this contention. But, even if it should be assumed that the right to the use of the cash reserve was waived, it is our opinion, when the contract is considered, including the application, the certificate with its provisions, and by-laws of the society, the contention of the appellant could not be sustained. It is the settled rule of this court that insurance contracts, like all others, must be considered as a whole, and the several parts construed together, those defining liability as well as those stipulating against it; and that, since the contract was written by the insurer, it must be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer; if there are any conflicting’ provisions, those most favorable to the insured must be given effect to effectuate the purpose for which the insured paid" his premiums, <em>i. e., </em>that his beneficiaries should be paid the stipulated sum in the event of his death. <em>American Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Hord, </em><a href="/ark/183/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="183 Ark. 266" data-case-ids="1441887" data-case-paths="/ark/183/0266-01">183 Ark. 266</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20S.W.2d%20353" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="35 S.W.2d 353">35 S.

B. McIntosh was the owner of the lands in question by purchase from the Hamlin Stave Company. The People’s Savings Bank advanced the purchase money for the lands to his vendor and held his unrecorded deeds as security for the advancement until he could sell the lands. On August 3,1922, he entered into a contract for the sale and purchase of them to appellee for $35,000, $5,000 of which amount was paid in cash, pending the consummation of the deal. The examination of the abstract by appellee’s attorneys was completed on October 18,. 1922, and accepted with a written understanding that McIntosh might procure patents for about forty pieces of the land at a later date and have them recorded. After the acceptance of the abstract, the parties met at the People’s Savings Bank to close the deal. McIntosh executed a deed for the lands to appellee, drew a draft for $10,000 on the Citizens’ National Bank of Boston, and appellee executed two notes to McIntosh for $10,000 each evidencing the balance of the purchase money; and these, together with the abstract and other muniments of title, were left in the People’s Savings Bank with directions to forward the draft for collection and the two notes for the indorsement of the Citizens’ National Bank of Boston; and when the draft was paid and the notes returned, to deliver them to McIntosh, and the deeds, abstracts, and other muniments of title, when patents were obtained, to appellee. About this time it was discovered that the national banking law prohibited a national 'bank from indorsing notes of this kind: so an attempt was made to close up the deal on the basis that Guy Ham, the president of said bank, should.personally <a id="p1138" href="#p1138" data-label="1138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1138</a>indorse the notes in the place of the bank. This arrangement was agreed upon dependent upon the approval of Ham’s indorsement by W. E.-Lenon. While W. E. Lenon was investigating the solvency and sufficiency of Guy Ham as indorser upon the notes, McIntosh became apprehensive lest the first deal might fail, and, having an opportunity to sell the lands to the Valley Planing Mill Company, gave it a week’s option to buy same for $34,500 on condition that the deal with the Lena Lumber Company should fail. At the time he executed the option, he gave the Valley Planing Mill Company a copy of his written contract with the Lena Lumber Company. The Valley Planing Mill Company obtained information that W. E. Lenon was not satisfied with the personal indorsement of Guy Ham upon the two $10,000 notes and that the draft had been returned unpaid, whereupon'it paid McIntosh $34,500 and obtained a deed from him to the lands. This understanding was obtained through conversation with W. E. Lenon, but it is quite evident that, at the time of the conversation, Lenon had not determined whether he would approve Ham’s personal indorsement. The Valley Planing Mill Company made no inquiry of appellee concerning the matter. On November 9, W. E. Lenon went away on a hunting trip before he had completed his investigation of the financial condition of Guy Ham. The sale of the lands by McIntosh to the Valley Planing Mill Company was completed November 14 before Lenon returned from the hunting trio and before he had decided whether the individual indorsement of Guy Ham. on the notes would be sufficient. Appellee had no notice of the option which McIntosh had executed to the Valley Planing Mill Company, and the first information it received of the sale was contained in a. registered letter written to it by 'McIntosh claiming that, on account of the failure to comply -with the terms of the contract of sale and purchase, he was forfeiting the contract by taking down the deposit of $5,000 and returnina- it, the draft for $10,000 and .the two. notes for $10,000 each.</p>
    <p id="b1157-2" data-blocks='[["BL_1157.3",1157,[133,368,1205,1668]]]'>
      <a id="p1139" href="#p1139" data-label="1139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1139</a>Appellant’s first contention for a reversal of the decree is appellee’s failure to pay the $10,000 draft. The insistence is made that this constituted a breach of the contract, thereby preventing appellee from demanding its specific performance. We do not think the failure to pay the draft under the circumstances in this case constituted a breach of the contract. As we read the contract, its payment was to be coincident 'with the indorsement of the notes and concurrent with the delivery of the deed as contended by appellee. Payment thereof was not refused but withheld pending the acceptance of the personal indorsement of the two notes by Ham, which indorsement had been offered and was being considered as a substitute for the indorsement of the Citizens National Bank of Boston. The validity of the indorsement of the Citizens National Bank of Boston had arisen when the parties came to close the contract. All the parties recognized that the contract had provided for an indorsement of the two $10,000 notes, which could not be enforced. When this discovery was made, appellee offered to substitute the individual indorsement of Huy A. Ham for that of the bank, which was satisfactory to McIntosh if it should meet with the approval of W. E. Lenon whose bank had advanced the money to McIntosh with which to purchase the land. Pending the investigation and decision of W. E. Lenon relative to the sufficiency of Ham’s personal indorsement, the matter was left <em>in statu quo. </em>The failure to pay the $10,000 draft during the time W. E. Lenon was considering the acceptance of Ham’s personal indorsement in lieu of that of the bank, could not, in good conscience, be treated as a refusal to pay same in the sense of breaching the contract.</p>

E. Lenon constituted a material change <a id="p1140" href="#p1140" data-label="1140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1140</a>in the original contract and was void because not in writ* ing. The contract in question related to the sale and purchase of real.estate; and, in order to be enforced, must have been in writing to meet the requirements of the statute of frauds. <em>St. L. I. M. &amp; S. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Beidler, </em><a href="/citations/?q=45%20Ark.%201" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="45 Ark. 1">45 Ark. 1</a>. The general rule is that a material modification of a contract within the statuté of frauds must be in writing in order to be valid and binding. Such a contract cannot be modified in essential parts by parol agreement so as to be valid against a plea of invalidity under the statute of frauds. <em>Arkmo Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Cantrell, </em><a href="/ark/159/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="159 Ark. 445" data-case-ids="8722866" data-case-paths="/ark/159/0445-01">159 Ark. 445</a>. There is a marked difference, however, between a modification of a written contract in the essentials required to meet the statute of frauds and an agreement for a substituted method of performance not within the statute. The former is required to be in writing in order to be enforceable as against a plea of the statute of frauds, whereas the latter is valid if in parol. The reason of the distinction is that the purpose of the statute of frauds is to require contracts to be certain and definite which it attempts to regulate, but does not attempt to regulate a substituted mode of performance thereof not within the statute. <em>Cummins </em>v. <em>Arnold </em>(Mass)., <a href="/citations/?q=37%20Am.%20Dec.%20155" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="37 Am.

The Valley Planing Mill Company took its option on the lands with full knowledge of the executory contract for the sale of same by McIntosh to appellee. In fact, it was furnished with a copy of the contract between McIntosh and appellee. It exercised its option to buy without making any inquiry whatever of appellee as to whether it had forfeited its rights under the contract.

Lenon as to whether the indorsement of Ham would be sufficient after getting further information as to his financial condition. At the time Lenon made the statement to appellee’s representative that he was not satisfied with Ham’s personal indorsement,. Lenon had not completed his investigation of Ham’s financial condition. He had the matter under advisement, and had agreed to' get a report from Bradstreet, and then make his decision and report to appellee, and give appellee an opportunity to furnish other secu-lity if Ham’s indorsement was hot sufficient. The rule is: '“Notice of facts putting a man of ordinary prudence on inquiry is tantamount to knowledge of the facts to which the inquiry might lead: ’ ’ <em>Halloway </em>v. <em>Eagle, </em><a href="/citations/?q=135%20Ark.%20205" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="135 Ark. 205">135 Ark. 205</a>, and cases cited therein. Had the Valley Planing Mill Company prosecuted the inquiry, it could have easily ascertained the real situation. We think, under the circumstances, that it should have made inquiry from some representative of appellee before exercising an option which it took from McIntosh, subject to the rights of appellee under a written contract with him for sale and purchase of the lands, a copy of which had theretofore been furnished to it.</p>

The only express requirement is that “the character of the improvement desired” must be stated in the petition, and there is a requirement by necessary implication that the territory to 'be annexed must be specified. There is no requirement, however, in express language or by necessary implication that the petition must set forth a limitation upon the cost of the improvement. There is nothing in the Constitution of the State which fixes any limitation upon the cost of the improvement, except that the cost shall not exceed the benefits. Since the Legislature has not seen fit to enact a law containing any requirement for a specification of a limitation, we cannot read such a requirement into the statute. It does not follow, however, that the power to annex is unrestricted. While it is unnecessary for the petition for annexation to specify the limitation upon the cost, we interpret the statute itself to mean that the cost of the additional improvement shall be limited to the proportionate cost of the original improvement. This limitation is expressed in the statute itself, and need not be expressed in the petition of the property owners. The statute (Crawford &amp; Moses’ 'Digest, § 5733) provides that the assessments on the annexed territory shall be made “on the same basis as if said territory was included in the original district.” This means that the proportionate cost shall be the same as in the original district, that is to say, the cost of the improvement ehall be in the same proportion to the assessed valuation as the cost of the improvement in the original district is to the assessed valuation of the property in that district. Otherwise the assessments on the annexed territory would not be “on the same basis as if said territory was included in the original district. ’ ’</p>

In other words, our decisions in those cases were that under the annexation statute the additional territory is brought into the original 'district for the construction of the improvement and the levying’ of assessments, the same as if the territory had originally been a part of the district, but that, so far '-as. imposing the burden of the expense of the improvement, the annexation is tantamount to the creation -of a new district without the imposition of new burdens on the original distinct, or the assumption of any burdens on the annexed territory for the cost of the original improvement. We think that it follows from this interpretation of the statute in those decisions that the annexation of the territory comes within the' restrictions specified in the original petition of the property owners in creating the district, and that it is unnecessary for a new specification to be made in the petition for the annexation. It becomes the duty of the commissioners under the law to ascertain the proportionate cost of the original improvement and to limit the cost of the new improvement'to the same proportion — not exceeding the same proportion to the couiity assessment of the property in the annexed territory for the year next preceding the formation of the original district. ‘</p>

In. the first place, we tfiink that, counsel, are mistaken in the contention that the act of 1925, <em>supra, </em>has any bearing upon these proceedings. The statute has. nothing to do with- the question of annexation, but <a id="p1131" href="#p1131" data-label="1131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1131</a>merely changes the law as to the formation of an original district, and, as the original district in this instance had been formed under prior statutes, the new statute is without effect. The'statute is not retroactive. The annexation statute, under our interpretation, places the limitation of cost the same as that in the original district, therefore The act of 1925 could have no bearing upon these proceedings. Nor do we agree with counsel as to the other contention that, in determining the proportionate cost, ' the combined cost of the entire improyement must be considered in its relation to the assessed value of the property in the entire territory, original and added. All that the annexation statute requires is that the new assessment of benefits on- the added territory must be made on the same basis as the assessments in the original territory, and this is fully accomplished by limiting the cost of the new improvement in the same proportion to the assessed value of the new territory to be added, the same as the proportionate cost of the original improvement to the property in the original district., ‘"If we construe the statute to mean that in arriving at this, proportion the cost of thecombinedimprovement is to be considered, then the basis of assessment in the new district would not be the same as that in th.e old district because'the assessments in the old district have already been made on a basis of the proportion of the cost of the original improvement to the assessed value of the property in the original district. It is shown in the present case, however, that the estimated cost of the additional improvement will not exceed fifty' per centum of the assessed value of the territory to be annexed.' Therefore, if the act 'of 1925, <em>supra, </em>had any application it would not' affect the validity of the present proceedings.</p>

Under the FFA, the Department of Commerce (Department) administers a mediation program to encourage home loan modifications in lieu of foreclosures. In that program, a beneficiary of a deed of trust must mediate with a residential borrower before the borrower’s home may be foreclosed. RCW 61.24.163. The FFA exempts from mediation certain beneficiaries that are relatively small banks, specifically federally insured depository institutions that were not a beneficiary of deeds of trust in more than 250 trustee sales of owner-occupied residential homes in Washington during the prior year.

A “deed of trust transaction” is “a three-party transaction in which the borrower (grantor) deeds the property to a trustee who holds the deed as security for the lender (beneficiary)” in return for the borrower having received a loan from the lender. Gose, <em>supra, </em>at 96. The DTA defines the relevant parties. RCW 61.24.005(2), (3), (7), (16). In the transaction’s simplest form, the borrower <em>is </em>the grantor and the lender <em>is </em>the beneficiary. The trustee acts as a neutral <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>third party and owes a “duty of good faith to the borrower, beneficiary, and grantor.” RCW 61.24.010(4).

The beneficiary must send a letter to the borrower containing certain information, including that the borrower should contact a housing counselor to discuss mediation under the FFA. <em>Id. </em>at (1)(c). The beneficiary must also engage in a sequence of phone calls to attempt to communicate with the borrower, a process known in the statute as “due diligence.” <em>Id. </em>at (5). If the borrower responds to these communications, the notice of default cannot issue for at least 90 days. <em>Id. </em>at (1)(a). During that period, the parties “shall attempt to reach a resolution,” such as a loan modification. <em>Id. </em>at (4); <em>see also id. </em>at (1)(e).

By definition, the PETE is the person entitled to enforce the note, i.e., to sue in its own name and collect on the note if the obligation has been dishonored. RCW 62A.3-301; <em>see also </em>RCW 62A.3-502 (defining “dishonor”). Thus, article 3 elsewhere provides that the borrower’s <em>“obligation is owed to </em>a person entitled to enforce the instrument[, the PETE].” RCW 62A.3-412 (emphasis added). As a consequence, the PETE may modify and discharge the note. <em>See </em>RCW 62A.3-604(a) (“A person entitled to enforce an instrument[, a PETE], with or without consideration, may discharge the obligation of a party to pay the instrument (i) by an intentional voluntary act, such as surrender of the instrument to the party, destruction, mutilation, or cancellation of the instrument, cancellation or striking out of the party’s signature, or the addition of words to the instrument indicating discharge, or (ii) by agreeing not to <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>sue or otherwise renouncing rights against the party by a signed writing.”). When the borrower pays the PETE—and <em>only </em>when the borrower pays the PETE—the borrower’s obligation is discharged. <em>See </em>RCW 62A.3-602(a) (“[A]n instrument is paid to the extent payment is made ... to a person entitled to enforce the instrument!, a PETE]. To the extent of the payment, the obligation of the party obliged to pay the instrument is discharged . . . .”).

If “a beneficiary of deeds of trust” refers to the owner of the note (here, Freddie Mac), the statute entitles Brown to mediation with Freddie Mac. That is because Freddie Mac is not a federally insured depository institution, so Freddie Mac cannot claim the exemption. But if “a beneficiary of deeds of trust” refers to the holder of the note (here, M&amp;T Bank), the statute does not entitle Brown to mediation. That is because M&amp;T Bank is a federally insured depository institution that has certified under penalty of perjury to the Department that it has been a beneficiary in less than 250 residential Washington homes in the last year. Thus, this case turns on whether “a beneficiary of deeds of trust” in the exemption statute means the “owner” or the “holder” of the note. The exemption statute itself does not answer that question, so the parties turn to related statutes.</p>

By enacting a program designed to promote the modification of notes, the legislature necessarily intended the party with the authority to negotiate and modify the note to be present in the FFA mediation session. <em>See </em>RCW 61.24-.163(7)(b)(ii) (requiring the mediator to send a notice stating that “a person with authority to agree to a resolution, including a proposed settlement, loan modification, or dismissal or continuation of the foreclosure proceeding, must be present. . . during the mediation session”). As discussed above, the party with such modification authority is the PETE, regardless of whether the PETE owns the note. <em>See supra </em>pp. 523-29.

Only <em>after </em>the notice of default has been issued may an attorney or housing counselor refer a borrower to FFA mediation. RCW 61.24.163(1).

A borrower can identify the note holder based on the information provided in the notice of default. The notice of default informs the borrower of the identity of the “servicer.” RCW 61.24.030(8)(l). “Servicer” is not a legal term of art. Homeowners use the word to refer to the bank to which they send mortgage payments because they reasonably believe the servicer is the person entitled to enforce <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>the note and because paying the servicer will discharge their obligation. That is true when the servicer holds the note. RCW 62A.3-301(i), -602(a).

This form language contemplates the traditional scenario where one party both owns and holds the note, making that party clearly the beneficiary. But the form does not require that the borrower’s obligation is <em>always </em>owed to the owner of the note because that would make the DTA conflict with article 3 of the UCC. Article 3 provides that a borrower’s “obligation <em>is owed to a person entitled to enforce </em>the instrument!, the PETE],” RCW 62A.3-412 (emphasis added), and “[a] person may be a person entitled to enforce the instrument!, a PETE,] even though the person is <em>not the owner </em>of the instrument,” RCW 62A.3-301 (emphasis added).</p>

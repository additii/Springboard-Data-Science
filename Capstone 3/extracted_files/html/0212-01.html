Most regularly compensated state employees and elected officials qualify for the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS). Certified public school teachers qualify for the Teachers’ Retirement System (TRS), while “classified” (noncertified) school district staff receive benefits under the School Employees’ Retirement System (SERS). There are three different pension plans, and benefits offered by Plans 1, 2, and 3 are consistent across the three systems.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Plan 1 is a defined benefit plan where members receive a fixed monthly pension amount regardless of the amount they actually contribute during employment.

Plan 3, alternately, is a hybrid pension plan with defined benefit and contribution components. The defined benefit portion is funded exclusively through employer contributions and the investment returns thereon. For the defined contribution portion, the employee chooses the contribution rate upon joining and controls the investment of the funds. The gain-sharing program at issue here applied to members of Plan 1 and Plan 3 of PERS and TRS and Plan 3 of SERS.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

State employers benefited significantly from this spike because their contribution rates for Plans 1 and 3 automatically adjusted downward to reflect the extra cash flow. But because employee contribution rates were fixed, the employees did not receive the same benefit. The legislature decided to share some of the upside with employees and passed the gain-sharing program in 1998. Laws of 1998, chs. 340 (PERS 1 and TRS 1), 341 (TRS 3 and SERS 3); Laws of 2000, ch. 247 (PERS 3).

Former RCW 41.31.020 (2006) (Plan 1); former RCW 41.31A.020 (2006) (Plan 3). Plan 1 members received their gain-sharing benefit as an increase to their postretirement annual cost of living adjustments (COLAs). Former RCW 41.31.010 (2006).

In sum, these two gain-sharing events augmented Plan 1 members’ COLAs by $924 million. Plan 3 members received $134.43 per year of service from the 1998 gain-sharing event, generating a $28 million expenditure. The 2000 gain-sharing event paid $254.23 per year of service to Plan 3 members for a total disbursement of $73 million.

Because employee contribution rates in Plans 1 and 3 were fixed, it became necessary to increase employer contribution rates after gain-sharing events to accommodate years of poor investment returns. In 2002, the legislature appointed a new state actuary. This new actuary quantified the monetary impact of gain sharing and recommended that employer contribution rates be increased in anticipation of future gain-sharing liabilities. The legislature directed a study of its options and ultimately decided to re<a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>peal gain sharing in 2007. Laws of 2007, eh. 491. The 2007 act eliminated gain sharing for employees hired after July 1, 2007 and discontinued gain sharing for existing employees as of January 2, 2008. This structure allowed existing employees to collect a gain-sharing benefit scheduled for January 1, 2008. Additionally, benefits already paid under the 1998 and 2000 gain-sharing events were not reclaimed. The 2007 act also enacted “replacement benefits” for members of each class. Plan 1 members received an increase in their COLAs, some Plan 2 and 3 members were allowed early retirement, and newly hired TRS and SERS members were allowed to choose between Plans 2 and 3, instead of being forced into Plan 3.</p>

That case concerns the legislature’s 2011 repeal of the uniform cost of living adjustment (UCOLA) program. Enacted by the legislature in 1995, UCOLA replaced a prior system of ad hoc COLAs with an automatic grant of annual COLAs based on a statutorily calculated increase amount per year of service. Laws of 1995, ch. 345. As with gain sharing, the legislature expressly reserved its right to modify or repeal UCOLA in the future. In fact, the reservation language is almost indistinguishable: “The legislature <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>reserves the right to amend or repeal this section in the future and no member or beneficiary has a contractual right to receive this postretirement adjustment not granted prior to that time.” Former RCW 41.32.489(6) (2010); former RCW 41.40.197(5) (2010).

Just like the parties in this case, the respondents in <em>WEA </em>I claimed that the 2011 repeal of the UCOLA program impaired their contract rights with the State. But as we explain, the 1995 creation of the UCOLA program also provided for its repeal. The repeal of UCOLA could never substantially impair existing contractual rights because a repeal of the program was expressly anticipated by the language of the contract.

The parties are in fact arguing over the enforceability of the reservation clause contained in the original gain-sharing legislation.

Here, the employees impliedly consented to the gain-sharing program, including its reservation clause, because gain sharing was a favorable addition to their employment contract. When the legislature instituted gain sharing in 1998, it did not replace any similar preexisting rights. Rather, gain sharing was a gratuitous addition to employees’ retirement packages. In this way, gain sharing, even more so than UCOLA and in spite of its reservation clause, represented a favorable modification to the employees’ contract with the State. Thus, the employees impliedly consented to the modification and gain sharing, as defined by the statute that created it, which then became part of their employment contract. In other words, gain sharing provided new advantages to employees compared to their prior benefits because gain sharing was <em>all </em>advantage.</p>

I would hold that the traditional contract clause analysis applies to contract clause challenges to statutes affecting public employee pension rights. As it was in <em>Charles, Bakenhus </em>is relevant to our contract clause analysis but does not replace it. <em>Id. </em>at 624 (citing <em>Bakenhus, </em>48 Wn.2d at 698-99, 701); <em>see also Wash.

Like the majority, I would hold that it did not. The original legislation stated that gain sharing could be adjusted or repealed at any time. <em>E.g., </em>Laws of 1998, ch. 340, § 3 (“The legislature reserves the right to amend or repeal this chapter in the future and no member or beneficiary has a contractual right to receive this postretirement adjustment not granted prior to that amendment or repeal.”), ch. 341, § 312(4). A contractual right is potentially impaired by a statute that alters its terms, imposes new conditions, or lessens its value. <em>Charles, </em>148 Wn.2d at 625 (citing <em>Wash. Fed’n of State Emps. v.

In this case, the language of the original gain-sharing statutes does not “ ‘evince a legislative intent to create private rights of a contractual nature’ ” in ongoing gain sharing. <em>Haberman v.

The threshold issue under <em>Bakenhus </em>is whether there is a pension right that has been changed by subsequent legislation. <em>E.g., </em>48 Wn.2d at 700. If there is a pension right that has been changed, then <em>Bakenhus </em>must be satisfied or the contract clause is violated. <em>See, e.g., Wash. Fed’n of State Emps., AFL-CIO, Council 28 v.

Here, the pension right at issue was the right to gain sharing for as long as the legislature allowed gain sharing. From its inception, the right was subject to the legislature’s explicitly reserved power to repeal or revoke it in the future. <em>See </em>Laws of 1998, ch. 340, § 3, ch. 341, § 312(4); Laws of 2000, ch. 247.

A person commits that crime if he “directs a threat” to a former witness because of the witness’s role in an official proceeding. RCW 9A.72.110(2). The statute defines a “threat” to mean “[t]o communicate, directly or indirectly, the intent” to harm another in various ways. <em>Id. </em>at (3)(a)(i); <em>see also id. </em>at (3)(a)(ii) (incorporating a similar definition of “threat”).</p>

In June 2010, Ozuna was incarcerated in the Yakima County Department of Corrections (Yakima County Jail). Ozuna was awaiting sentencing for a prior conviction. The conduct underlying that conviction involved Augustine Jaime Avalos, a member of the same gang as Ozuna. Avalos had testified against Ozuna in Ozuna’s underlying trial and was also incarcerated in the Yakima County Jail.</p>

The officer confiscated the letters because Ozuna was not allowed to have the letters in the new cell and because the envelope in which they were found listed a return address for another inmate, Marc Cole. A handwriting expert testified that Ozuna wrote the letters.

The detective believed Ozuna’s letter targeted Avalos, and the detective was concerned for Avalos’s safety because Avalos was a former gang member with Ozuna and had testified against him. The detective had investigated Ozuna’s underlying crime and was present during trial. On the day the detective showed Avalos the letter, she also conducted a recorded interview with him. The content of that interview was not admitted as substantive evidence at trial.</p>

The call was recorded, admitted into evidence, and played to the jury. During the call, Ozuna stated, “[T]hey wrote me up for tampering with a witness—or not tampering—threatening a witness.” <em>Id. </em>at 390. Ozuna then said he thought “they’re going to show the letter to the [sentencing] judge or some shit,” so he said he was going to “be prepared [for the sentencing hearing] and <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>I’m like hey man, you’ve got to understand, you know, I’m doing ten years because of this gato and I was mad and—[inaudible on tape—language]—you know?

Avalos received stiches at the hospital for his injuries. The inmates who were present when Avalos was injured were not cooperative. No evidence suggests that Ozuna was present during the assault.</p>

The State attempted to impeach his credibility with questions based on his recorded interview given to the detective on June 22. For example, when Avalos was asked, “And you received some verbal threats?,” he testified, “Like I said, people talk a lot through their doors.” <em>Id. </em>at 422. He was asked, “Isn’t it true that you said [in the recorded interview] you did receive a letter that stated that the homeys were waiting for you in a shelter ... to take care of you?,” but he responded, “I don’t remember that, no.” <em>Id.</em>

He responded, “[I]t’s not just the BGL gang, it’s all of the gang members so I’m not going to clump just one; it’s the whole entire culture of the gang culture. That is one of their main staples, the no snitch credo.” <em>Id. </em>And the State asked, “If a gang member felt like another gang member snitched on them would it be likely to see some retaliation?” <em>Id. </em>at 443. He answered, “Likely!?] [N]o, there will <em>be.” Id. </em>The expert testified about the hierarchical decision-making structure of gangs, explaining that for a significant action—such as the retaliation against a former witness—to be taken, someone high in the gang must authorize the action or else it cannot proceed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Ultimately, the officer testified about how the content of Ozuna’s undelivered letter was consistent with gang culture.</p>

We reject this notion. The very concept of a “communication” conveys the idea that something is communicated to someone. <em>E.g., </em>Black’s Law Dictionary 337 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “communication” as “the process of bringing an idea to another’s perception”); Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 460 (2002) (defining “communication” as “the act or action of imparting or transmitting” and as “interchange of thoughts or opinions : a process by which meanings are exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols (as language, signs, or gestures)”).

Avalos had been a longtime gang member with Ozuna, and Avalos testified against Ozuna. They were incarcerated in the same prison. Ozuna had gang allies in the prison. Avalos had enemies. Testimony established the gang follows a strict “no snitch” code, enforced by violent retaliation. Ozuna’s confiscated letter reveals his state of mind. It said, for example, “[L]et that fool feel the wrath and let’em know the rata that he is and tell ’em that I siad that bad things come to those that snitch. May he rest in piss.” State Ex. ID at 2. Additionally, the jury could consider the timing of Avalos’s assault by a member of Ozuna’s gang, David Soto. The evidence is sufficient insofar as it establishes Ozuna’s state of mind, motivation, and opportunity to direct a threat regarding Avalos.</p>

An officer in the Yakima County Jail specifically testified that Ozuna was a shot caller or tank boss with such elevated decision-making authority. A member of Ozuna’s gang later assaulted Avalos. Viewing a reasonable inference from this testimony in favor of the State, a rational jury could conclude that the only way Soto had authority to engage in the assault on Avalos was because Ozuna directed him to do so.</p>

Perren testified that he communicated with Ozuna in the prison through letters.

Perren testified that he “forward [ed the] message” to an unspecified group of prisoners so that “they could leave him alone, anybody that came across him.” <em>Id. </em>at 476.

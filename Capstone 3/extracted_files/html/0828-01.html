C.W. was present at T.A.W.’s birth and signed the paternity affidavit confirming that he is T.A.W.’s father. Though the parties dispute the exact duration, C.W., C.B., and T.A.W. resided together between four months to one year following T.A.W.’s birth. At some point during this period, the parties shared a home on the Shoalwater Bay Tribe reservation. C.W. and C.B. dispute how much of the parenting responsibilities C.W. contributed, but C.W. testified that he cared for T.A.W. while C.B. worked. C.B. eventually asked C.W. to leave the family home because of C.W.’s addiction to methamphetamine.</p>

When C.B. refused permission, C.W. punched a wall in C.B.’s home while T.A.W. was present. As part of the dissolution proceedings, the court granted C.B. a <a id="p836" href="#p836" data-label="836" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*836</a>temporary restraining order (TRO) that prevented C.W. from contacting her. The TRO permitted only supervised visits between C.W. and T.A.W. until C.W. completed drug treatment. However, C.W. did not attempt to visit T.A.W. during the dissolution proceedings.</p>

Aside from those two occurrences, C.B.’s mother claimed she was unable to facilitate any additional visitations because C.W. no longer resided in the area. C.W. testified that his drug addiction prevented him from maintaining his visitations with T.A.W.</p>

In October of that year, the Shoalwater Bay Tribal Court modified the protection order to permit C.W. to petition for rehearing if he completed at least six months of domestic violence perpetrator classes. During the same period, C.B. petitioned the superior court for modification of the parenting plan based on C.W.’s recent release from prison, allegations of C.W.’s suspected involvement in an unsolved murder, and the fact that the protection order was still in place preventing C.W. from contacting C.B. Based on these assertions, the court modified the parenting plan. As <a id="p837" href="#p837" data-label="837" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*837</a>modified, the parenting plan prohibited all visitations between C.W. and T.A.W.</p>

WICWA’s definition of “Indian child” is nearly identical to ICWA’s definition. <em>See </em>RCW 13.38.040(7) (“ ‘Indian child’ means an unmarried and unemancipated Indian person who is under eighteen years of age and is either: (a) A member of an Indian tribe; or (b) eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.”). Under WICWA, “parent” is defined as “a biological parent or parents of an Indian child or a person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child, including adoptions made under tribal law or custom.” RCW 13.38.040(13). The express language of WICWA states that it “shall apply in <em>all </em>child custody proceedings.” RCW 13.38.020 (emphasis added). WICWA also defines “child custody proceeding” to include foster care placement, termination of parental rights,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> preadoptive placement, and adoptive placement. RCW 13-.38.040(3). Like ICWA, WICWA exempts custody determinations stemming from delinquency proceedings and custody determinations following divorce where one parent retains custody. <em><a href="/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201903" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="25 U.S.C. § 1903">Id.</a></em>

Though the rules do not come into effect until December 12,2016, they are nevertheless informative.

Under Washington law, because C.B. and C.W. were married at the time T.A.W. was born, C.W. was presumed to be his father. RCW 26.26.116(1)(a). This has never been disputed. Pursuant to the Court’s analysis in <em>Adoptive Couple, </em>RCW 26.26.116(1)(a) establishes that C.W. had <em>legal </em>custody of T.A.W. because he was T.A.W.’s father from birth. Additionally, it remains undisputed that for at least four months following T.A.W.’s birth, C.W. lived with C.B. and shared parental responsibility for T.A.W. This establishes, consistent with <em>Adoptive Couple, </em>that C.W. had actual <em>physical </em>custody of T.A.W. for a time. Even following C.B. and C.W.’s divorce, C.W. retained visitation rights with T.A.W. Finally, C.W. has never voluntarily relinquished his parental rights to T.A.W. and has never <a id="p861" href="#p861" data-label="861" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*861</a>evidenced an intent to do so. In fact, C.W. attempted to reestablish visitation following his second release from prison.

As previously explained, once its protections are triggered, WICWA excepts only delinquency proceedings and custody determinations following divorce where one parent retains custody—there is no additional exception for abandonment under WICWA. Our interpretation of WICWA therefore provides additional protection to the parents of Indian children by preventing termination when tribal culture would otherwise permit the long-term absence of parents. <em>See </em>Dustin C.

Specifically, the Court of Appeals stated, “This statute unequivocally provides that under Washington law, ICWA applies to <em>all </em>termination cases in which the child is an Indian.

Relevant here, the trial court found that within less than six months after T.A.W.’s December 23, 2007 birth, C.W. was addicted to methamphetamine. In the spring of 2009, C.W. engaged in domestic violence against C.B., and C.B. obtained a temporary protection order and filed for dissolution. During the year preceding these events, “[C.W.] had extremely limited contact with [T.A.W.]. Any contact between the father and the child was initiated by [C.B.] or [C.W.’s] mother, not by any effort of [C.W.].” Clerk’s Papers at 91.

The court found that from the summer of 2010, C.W. did not communicate with T.A.W. in any way that demonstrated love or affection for the child, that C.W. was “currently unfit to parent [T.A.W.],” that C.W. was “currently incapable of providing a safe environment for [T.A.W.],” that it is in T.A.W.’s best interest that C.W.’s parental rights be terminated, and that T.A.W. is presently in a “stable home” with C.B. and his stepfather and has bonded with the stepfather. <em>Id. </em>at 92. All of these findings find support in the trial transcript. Yet the majority chooses to discount these findings because the trial court did not expressly label them as addressing C.B.’s “active efforts” prior to seeking termination of C.W.’s parental rights.

That is the circumstance and the appropriate result here also. Like <em>C.A.V., </em>the mother here facilitated the development of the father’s relationship with the Indian child, but those efforts were unsuccessful.

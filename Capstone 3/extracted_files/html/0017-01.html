The WSBA charged Jones with four counts of misconduct arising out of litigation involving his mother’s estate. The counts include failing to comply with discovery requests, engaging in frivolous litigation, and dishonestly and intentionally manipulating the value of the estate. Jones challenges each count. The hearing officer and a unanimous Board concluded that Jones violated RPC 3.1,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> 3.4(c) and (d),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and 8.4(c) and (d).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The hearing officer recommended that Jones be disbarred.

The brothers met in May 1996 to divide up the estate’s personal property, and at this meeting Jeffrey selected the piano valued at $5,000. At this meeting, Jones also informed his brothers that the house was appraised at $155,000, less defects. Despite their requests, Jones did not give Peter or Jeffrey a copy of either appraisal. The hearing officer found Jones’ testimony that he showed Peter a copy of the appraisal not credible and rejected testimony from Jones’ brother David that the appraisals were available at <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>the May meeting. Peter, both at the meeting and in writing, offered to purchase the house at the price of $155,000, but Jones did not respond to Peter’s offers. Even with Peter’s offers and without telling the cobeneficiaries, Jones deeded the house to himself at a value of $125,866.27 and did not record the deed.</p>

The court commissioner ordered that he provide the information and documents, but Jones, as attorney for the estate, successfully moved to revise the order. In November 1998, after still not receiving any of the requested documents from Jones, Peter and Jeffrey petitioned for a judicial proceeding to remove Jones as PR. Peter and Jeffrey also filed a complaint for use of estate assets by a PR for personal benefit and for breach of fiduciary duty. In response to these actions, Jones asserted that he occupied the house according to an agreement by all heirs. This response was false because there was no such agreement among the heirs. In December 1998 Jones filed a declaration of comple<a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>tion, swearing that he had completed a final accounting.

Before mediation, Jones sent Judge Clarke an accounting of the estate distributions. This accounting purported to show that the distributions among the brothers were equal. The accounting document was the first time that Peter and Jeffrey learned that Jones had distributed the house to himself for $125,866.27 and that Jones claimed the piano was valued at $14,950.00 rather than the original valuation of $5,000.00. The hearing officer found that the increase in the piano’s value was to get back at Jeffrey for challenging Jones’ administration of the estate. Jones claims that the increase in amount was based on a conversation with Stephen Bagmanyan, Jones’ client and expert on pianos. Bagmanyan never saw the piano in person.</p>

Judge Baker stated that her findings regarding the value of the house and piano would have a preclusive effect on subsequent litigation. In addition, Judge Baker asserted that her findings were necessary to reach her decision on other issues and that such findings “will then be res judicata for any further factual determinations in this litigation.” Ex. A-27, at 2. She then appointed James Woodard as the PR of the estate.</p>

By receiving sanctions, Jones was aware of his RPC violations but persisted with his conduct. Jones’ testimony indicates that he planned to continue this pattern of filings.

By the time of Jones’ disciplinary hearing, he had accumulated sanctions in the amount of $138,881.68. Some of this was paid out of the estate, but by the time of the hearing, Jones still owed Peter and Jeffrey $123,901.93. The findings of fact indicate that Jones avoided paying sanctions and avoided answering questions about the lack of payment. The WSBA asserts that the sanctions were imposed to compensate Jeffrey and Peter for the financial costs imposed on them by Jones’ frivolous litigation from 2004-2012. As such, it would be reasonable to consider the sanctions as restitution. There was substantial evidence to show that Jones avoided the payment of sanctions, hid his assets, and violated court orders. Thus, the indifference to restitution aggravating factor applies to Jones.</p>

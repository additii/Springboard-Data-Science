That initiative establishes a $15-per-hour minimum wage and other benefits and rights for employees in the hospitality and transportation industries in the city of SeaTac. <em>See </em>ch. 7.45 SeaTac Municipal Code. Opponents of Proposition 1 challenged its validity under state and federal law. The trial court largely rejected these challenges, with two exceptions. The trial court held that (1) under state law, Proposition 1 could not be enforced <a id="p779" href="#p779" data-label="779" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*779</a>at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and (2) federal labor law preempted a provision of Proposition 1 protecting workers from certain types of retaliation. We reverse both of these rulings. We hold that Proposition 1 can be enforced at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport because there is no indication that it will interfere with airport operations. We also hold that federal labor law does not preempt the provision protecting workers from retaliation. We otherwise affirm the trial court and thus uphold Proposition 1 in its entirety.</p>

In June 2013, the Committee circulated a petition to city of SeaTac voters that proposed a set of minimum employment standards for certain hospitality and transportation employers in the city of SeaTac, including an hourly minimum wage of $15.

The Port of Seattle is a special-purpose municipal corporation that, among other things, owns and operates the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport within the city of SeaTac’s territorial boundaries. In the amended complaint, Filo Foods alleged that Proposition 1 is invalid on a number of grounds, including that it (1) violates the single-subject rule, (2) violates the Port of Seattle’s jurisdiction over the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, (3) is preempted by federal labor and aviation laws, and (4) violates the dormant commerce clause.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

First, the trial court determined that Proposition 1 did not violate the single-subject rule. Second, the trial court held that Proposition 1 violates a state law that gives the Port of Seattle jurisdiction over the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and thus could not be enforced at the airport. Third, the trial court held that federal labor law preempts Proposition l’s antiretaliation provision, but that federal law did not otherwise preempt Proposition 1. Finally, the trial court held that Proposition 1 did not violate the dormant commerce clause.

First, Filo Foods argues that Proposition 1 is procedurally invalid in its entirety because it violates the single-subject rule. We hold that Proposition 1 does not violate the single-subject rule. Second, Filo Foods contends that under state law, Proposition 1 may not be applied at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. We conclude that Proposition 1 can be applied at the airport because there is no indication that it will interfere with airport operations. Third, Filo Foods argues that federal law preempts Proposition 1, in whole or, alternatively, in part. We conclude federal law does not preempt Proposition 1 in whole or in part. Finally, Filo Foods argues that Proposition 1 violates the dormant commerce clause; we conclude that it does not. Thus, we find Proposition 1 valid in its entirety.</p>

And, although the public safety earmark’s connection with the measure’s liquor privatization provisions was arguably tenuous, we found the earmark to be germane to liquor privatization given the enforcement burdens the measure places on local governments, and given the legislature’s past recognition of the relationship between liquor regulation and public welfare. <em>Id. </em>at 657-58.</p>

That provision would be meaningless if the Port of Seattle could trump such laws in airports it controls. RCW 49.46.120 does not carve out an exception for airports, and RCW 14.08.330 does not contain any language indicating that the Port of Seattle’s jurisdiction and control over the airport includes the power to trump local minimum wage laws.

Proposition 1 creates no such supplemental sanction for violations of the NLRA. Rather than providing an employee a remedy for illegal retaliation for exercising rights protected under the NLRA, Proposition 1 provides an employee a remedy for illegal retaliation for exercising rights protected under Proposition 1. The two are not the same. Proposition 1 is self-contained. If an employer takes an adverse action against an employee because the employee reported a minimum wage violation under Proposition 1, the employer violates Proposition l’s antiretaliation provision. But in this scenario, the employer does not necessarily violate the NLRA’s antiretaliation provision nor become subject to a new sanction for a NLRA violation. Proposition l’s antiretaliation provision is thus not a supplemental sanction appended to the NLRA but instead protects against retaliation for the exercise of rights under its provisions.

The exception provides, “However, ... a municipality in which an airport ... is located” (the city of SeaTac) “may be responsible for the administration and enforcement of the uniform fire code ... on that portion of any airport . . . located with its jurisdictional boundaries,” so long as it does this “by agreement with the municipality operating and controlling the airport” (the Port of Seattle). <em>Id. </em>Thus, a fire code is the single circumstance in which the city of SeaTac can enforce its laws within the airport.</p>

If the legislature intended the operating municipality’s exclusive jurisdiction to be over only that narrow functional concept, why would the legislature specify an exception from the operating municipality’s exclusive jurisdiction to allow the municipality in which the airport sits to enforce <em>a fire code </em>at the airport? Under the majority’s view of the statute, the fire-code exception is simply unneeded because the city of SeaTac can already enforce a fire code at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport because that does not concern “airport operations or the subjection of aeronautics,” <em>id.</em>

Under the majority’s holding, the fire code exception seems misplaced. If the city of SeaTac can <em>unilaterally </em>impose other measures at the airport, such as Proposition l’s sweeping wage and employee right protections, what is the point of requiring the Port of Seattle’s consent to enforce a minimally intrusive fire code?

The majority simply asserts and concludes, “Proposition 1 has nothing to do with airport operations or the subject of aeronautics.” Majority at 790-91. Yet, Proposition l’s text specifically regulates the performance of quintessential airport activities that the Port of Seattle contracts for, regulates, and licenses, including “aircraft interior cleaning; aircraft carpet cleaning; aircraft washing and cleaning; aviation ground support equipment washing and cleaning; aircraft water or lavatory <a id="p816" href="#p816" data-label="816" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*816</a>services; [and] aircraft fueling.” SeaTac Municipal Code 7.45-.010(M)(l)(a); see <em>also </em>Br. of Resp’t Port of Seattle at 27-32 (describing the Port of Seattle’s regulation of these and other activities that Proposition 1 attempts to regulate).

RCW 49.46.120 does not carve out an exception for airports, and RCW 14.08.330 does not contain any language indicating that the Port of Seattle’s jurisdiction and control over the airport includes the power to trump local minimum wage laws.

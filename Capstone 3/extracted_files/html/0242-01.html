(Forth) appeal the dismissal of their separate actions against the State of Washington Department of Natural Resources, Weyerhaeuser Company, and Green Diamond Resource Company (collectively DNR). Their suits, filed in Rang County Superior Court, seek monetary damages for the flooding of real property located in Lewis County. At issue is the distinction between venue and jurisdiction, in the context of a statute providing that actions “for any injuries to real property” “shall be commenced” in the county in which the property is located. RCW 4.12.010(1). Case law from the 1940s and 1950s held that RCW 4.12.010 is jurisdictional, so that an improperly commenced action must be dismissed if filed in a superior <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>court outside the local county. <em>See, e.g., Snyder v.

Just the opposite is true. In many instances, the legislature has authorized courts to adjudicate matters affecting title to real property outside their geographical boundaries. RCW 6.32.240 and RCW 6.32.270 specifically authorize courts to resolve title disputes over “any real property” necessary to satisfy judgments entered by them. <em>A&amp;W Farms v.

And, in probate matters, the legislature has given to “[t]he superior court of every county” jurisdiction, RCW 11.96A.040(1), to resolve “[a] 11 matters concerning the estates and assets of incapacitated, missing, and deceased persons,” RCW 11.96A.020(1)(a), and states venue is proper in “any county . . . the petitioner selects,” RCW 11.96A-.050(4). These statutes recognize that the resolution of an action can involve multiple properties situated in different counties and that it would be impractical to require parties to litigate matters in different courts or inconvenient venues simply to protect the interests of prospective buyers and lenders. Instead, the legislature provides mechanisms outside of RCW 4.12.010 to protect interested persons and to facilitate the efficient transfer and resolution of real property matters. One example is RCW 4.28.150.

Today we discard the erroneous label and hold that RCW 4.12.010 relates to mandatory venue, not jurisdiction. This reading of the statute is consistent with our treatment of similar language in other statutes and court rules, avoids unnecessary constitutional conflict, and maintains the fundamental distinction between jurisdiction and venue.</p>

Town of Twisp, </em><a href="/wash-2d/133/0769-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="133 Wash. 2d 769" data-case-ids="331069" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/133/0769-01">133 Wn.2d 769</a>, 790-91, <a href="/citations/?q=947%20P.2d%20732" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="947 P.2d 732">947 P.2d 732</a> (1997) (Durham, C.J., concurring)). Because RCW 4.12.010 applies to personal property as well as real property, treatment of its filing requirements as jurisdictional has had the absurd effect of requiring plaintiffs to track moving objects and to synchronize the commencement of their actions with the present location of those objects. <em>See </em>RCW 4.12.010(2); <em>Snyder, </em>48 Wn.2d at 638-42. <em>Snyder </em>aptly illustrates the difficulty. The property at issue in <em>Snyder </em>was a stolen car, a 1955 Buick. 48 Wn.2d at 637. Upon holding that the statute was jurisdictional, we concluded that the action was improperly filed (and conse<a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>quently dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction) because the Buick was in Chelan County, not King County, at the time the case commenced. <em>Id. </em>at 638, 642.

Under article IV, section 6 of the Washington Constitution, each superior court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear these types of claims; the legislature cannot restrict the superior court’s subject matter jurisdiction. However, the legislature may impose further restrictions on the power of its courts to assert territorial jurisdiction. RCW 4.12.010 is such a restriction; the statute restricts a court’s exercise of its territorial jurisdiction when an action involving real property is commenced in the wrong county.

In the earliest case on this issue, the Supreme Court of the Territory of Washington held that “all actions for the causes mentioned in [RCW 4.12.010] <em>must be commenced </em>in the county or district in which the subject of the action lies, and the Court of no other county or district has jurisdiction.” <em>Wood, </em><a href="/wash-terr/2/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="176" data-cite="2 Wash.

I share amicus’s concern that this would make the process for transferring title to real property more difficult, expensive, and time consuming because parties conducting a title examination would presumably have to search the records in all 39 Washington state counties to verify that a property is not the subject of current or past litigation. Worse yet, a buyer might purchase property after diligently searching county records for title information, never knowing of a cloud on title recorded elsewhere. <em>See Hayes v.

Importantly, supplemental proceedings are not in rem proceedings and so do not affect title against all possible parties.

It is not only, as the majority asserts at 256, that “it may be more convenient” to have all title records filed on the county in which the property is located if no one files a lis pendens in the proper county, any nonparty might be lulled into the mistaken notion that they are purchasing a property while unaware that a fierce title action is raging elsewhere. The majority dismisses these concerns by inaccurately asserting that RCW 4.28.160 “requires plaintiffs to record at the onset of litigation a lis pendens in each county where disputed property is located.” Majority at 256. Although the statute permits the filing of a lis pendens, nothing requires a party to do so.

A lawsuit filed in the county where the property is located automatically gives notice to anyone who consults the county records that the lawsuit is pending, and even if the lawsuit is subsequently transferred, anyone consulting the county records will still be on notice of the lawsuit. This straightforward rule, which has been the rule in Washington for over 160 years, effectively provides notice without reliance on a party’s filing a lis pendens in the proper county.

It is insisted that this is not a case in which estoppel or waiver applies, but that under the undisputed evidence a case is presented “where, with a full knowledge of all the facts as to the provision of the contract and as to the facts inquired about, Long gave an untrue answer to the question as to whether he had consulted a physician within the last five <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>years”; that to these facts an application of the principle announced in <em>Ins.

As we understand the rule laid down in the Reutlinger case, it is merely to the effect that, if a false answer is knowingly made by the insured with the knowledge of the agent of the company, and the two collude to defraud the company by means of the false answer, the policy of insurance is void. In the Mudge case the inference to be drawn from the testimony was that the assured was as well informed of the nature of the question as was the agent. The question was, “Have you ever had the disease of insanity?” This question was answered in the negative, when in fact the insured had at one time been insane, and the examining physician was well aware of this fact. Therefore, both the insured and the physician knew that the answer was false, and thereby colluded to defraud the insurer.</p>

The appellant introduced several physicians who testified that they had examined the insured in a hospital in Little Rock in June, 1927. Appellee then called the physician who had made the examination of the insured at the time of his application and who wrote the answers in the application. It developed that this physician and •.the insured both lived in the town of G-urdon, and that the ‘medical examiner had been the physician of the insured for a period of time from five to ten years. This physician testified that the insured had never had any disease of a serious nature before the application for insurance was made; that he knew that the insured had gone to the <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>Missouri Pacific Hospital in June, 1927, and that he had treated him two days before he went there for a slight indisposition, describing the ailment and its result as “a bilious attach and a bad cold — he had got kind o’ knocked out, as we call it.”</p>
    <p id="b344-3" data-blocks='[["BL_344.4",344,[308,644,1208,1482]]]'>Long was a brakeman in the employ of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, and as such was entitled to free treatment in the hospital of the company whenever he was indisposed. Employees of the railroad company made frequent use of the hospital advantages as they were transported to and from their homes to the hospital and there cared for without any cost to them. For this reason they would go to the hospital, even though troubled with only minor ailments. The physician who took the application was, and had been, employed by the appellant company for the purpose of examining applicants for insurance for eight or ten years. The blank applications would be sent to him for use as occasion required. He testified that he made the examination of Long in November, 1927, and that he, himself, wrote the answers to the questions that were contained in the application. Referring to the blank spaces left for the insertion of the answers to questions he was asked “Did you fill those in,” and he answered, “Yes, sir — in answer to his question, or father my questions.” Witness was also asked the following question: “Just tell how you conducted the examination, doctor.” To this question the appellant objected, and, after some colloquy between counsel and the court, the objection was sustained and the witness was not permitted to answer. The witness was then asked, “Doctor, in the application you were asked if he had consulted a physician and the answer is, no. You wrote that answer down?” The witness answered, “Yes, sir.”</p>

We think it may be <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>fairly deduced from this testimony and from the nature of the ailments of the applicant, for which he was treated by the physician before his visit to the hospital, that these were, as thought by the physician, only temporary in their nature, attendant merely with bodily discomfort and without any serious consequence such as would affect his general health or life expectancy; that this was known to the physician and also that the applicant had stayed about three or four days in the hospital some three or four months before the date of the application, and that he had gone there because of a bilious attack and a cold, and that with this knowledge the physician placed his own interpretation on the question and gave an answer based on that interpretation which he believed was true; that this was the answer of the physician himself and not that of the applicant. It will be remembered that the physician was asked to state how he conducted the examination of the applicant, and on objection of the appellant was not permitted to testify. This testimony should have been admitted, for it was not for the purpose of varying the answers, but to show specifically how and by whom the answers were in fact given, and, if not literally true, why a false answer was written. As the examining physician at that time was the witness of the appellee and the agent of the appellant at the time the application was made, it must be presumed that both knew the answer that would be given, and, since the appellant prevented this testimony by his objection, the inference is that it would have been unfavorable to it, <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Jones, </em><a href="/ark/32/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="32 Ark. 337" data-case-ids="1877185" data-case-paths="/ark/32/0337-01">32 Ark. 337</a>.</p>

W. 1016</a>, was an action based upon a policy of fire insurance, and one of the defenses was that one of the representations made by Brodie, which was by express agreement of the parties a warranty, was false. The question was, “Do all the stove pipes go directly into brick chimneys'?” and the answer was, “Yes,” while in truth the stove pipes did not go into brick chimneys, but ran directly through the roof. It was shown that the answers were not written by Brodie but by the agent of the insurance company and signed by Brodie. To the application was appended a statement to the effect that the applicant warranted each of the answers to the questions to be true. There was evidence that the agent personally inspected the property at the time of the application and knew the condition of the stove pipes. The court instructed the jury that the false statements vitiated the policy unless the agent of the company inspected the property and informed the applicant that the facts warranted the answer. In approving this instruction, the court quoted with approval from <em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em><a href="/us/80/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="13 Wall. 222" data-case-ids="1134248" data-case-paths="/us/80/0222-01">13 Wall. 222</a>, as follows: “They (the agents) not unfrequently mislead the insured by a false or erroneous statement of what the application should contain, or, taking the preparation of it into their own hands, procure his signature by an assurance that it is properly drawn, and will meet the <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>requirements of the policy. The better opinion seems to be that, when this course is pursued, the description of the risk should, though nominally proceeding from the insured, be regarded as the act of the insurers.

If such facts are to be held to be a breach of such a clause, they are a breach <em>eo instanti </em>of the making of the contracts, and are so known to be by the company as well as the insured, and to allow the company to take the premium without taking the risk, would be to encourage a fraud. ’ ’ Concluding, this court said: “We therefore conclude that the appellant was estopped from taking advantage of the falsity of the answer appended to the question, ‘Do all stove pipes go directly into brick chimneys?’ if, at the time the policy sued on was issued, it, personally, or through its agent, knew or had notice of, the facts which the question was intended to elicit.” The doctrine of that case has been reaffirmed in <em>People’s Fire Ins.

The court did not err in its refusal to give the instructions requested by appellant because they ignored the question of estoppel and were equivalent to a peremptory instruction to find for the defendant.</p>

An examination of the testimony of the examining physician, which was the only testimony offered on the question of estoppel, shows that there was no objection made to. the evidence on the ground that it was not responsive to the. pleadings. The only exception saved Avas to the overruling of an objection to a question asked the doctor if the applicant had ever consulted him or any other physician with reference to any serious illness, and the objection was not on the ground that there was no plea of estoppel, but that “it sought to <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>contradict the’ statement the man adopted as Ms own as the basis of the contract.” As the evidence warranted the submission of the question, it was not an abuse of the court’s discretion to treat the pleadings amended to conform to the proof and to submit the issue to the jury. <em>Anglin </em>v. <em>Marr Canning Co., </em><a href="/ark/152/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="152 Ark. 1" data-case-ids="1364129" data-case-paths="/ark/152/0001-01">152 Ark. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=237%20S.W.%20440" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="237 S.W. 440">237 S.

The appellant insists that under the decisions of the Ohio courts an interpretation has been placed upon clauses in insurance policies, similar to the one in question, which operated to constitute a waiver of the right to claim privileged communications under the statute. <em>Wills </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., supra. </em>While the contract before us is by agreement of the parties to be construed as an Ohio contract, the laws of that State have no application except as to the construction of the contract, and the competency of the testimony and its admissibility are to be determined by the law of the forum. 5 R.

W. 83</a>. Our statute, § 4149, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, makes the information which a doctor or trained nurse obtains, acting in their professional capacities, which is necessary to enable them to prescribe as a physician or act as a trained nurse, privileged, and this statute was passed for the protection not only of themselves, but for their patients. A patient, however, may waive the privilege by' calling the physician to testify or by a clause in the contract on which suit is brought, and if the privilege is waived by a clause in the contract that waiver binds any one who claims thereunder. In the case at bar, however, the contract did not contain any such clause, and the court properly refused to admit the testimony of the physicians. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>

According to her testimony, she is the widow of Everett Piety and the mother of Noble Piety, both of whom were killed by Bill Stepp in Greene County, Arkansas, in June, 1925. Noble Piety would have been ■twenty-two years of age had he lived until the 22d day of December, 1925. Her husband had rented the "Woosley place, and was living on it with his family at the time he was killed. Her husband had rented a part of the land from Mr. Woosley himself and a hayfield from Mr. Stepp, who was Mr. Woosley’s overseer. On the morning her son and husband were killed, Mrs. Piety went with a little <a id="p1063" href="#p1063" data-label="1063" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1063</a>boy named Welch to a drainage ditch on the Woosley farm to pick berries. When she got in sight of the hayfield, she saw the defendant and her husband in it, fighting. She went on to where they were,- but they stopped fighting before she got there. Mr. Stepp went over into the woods adjoining the hayfield, after the fight. Her husband told Mr. Stepp to take his team and get off of the place and stay off until his rent ran out. In a few moments Mr. Stepp started towards a little house, and Mr. Piety started to unhitch the horses. Her son, Noble, was assisting his father in unhitching- the traces. The witness begged her husband and son to go to the house with her. Her husband replied that Stepp had rented him the hayfield, and that he was going to have the hay. By that time Mr. Stepp was coming back, and the witness told her husband to run and not have any trouble with him. Her husband replied, “Pie won’t shoot me. He rented that hay to me himself. ’ ’ The witness then turned to her son and told him to run, and he said, “No, mamma, I’ll stay with papa as long as there is breath in my body. ” About that time Mr. Stepp came up with his gun drawn on Mr. Piety, and Mrs. Piety begged him not to shoot. Noble took a few steps toward Mr. Stepp, and Mr. Stepp shot him down. Her son was not armed at the time. He did not have a hoe or anything else. The witness was begging Mr. Stepp not to shoot her husband at the time, and her son was also begging Stepp not to shoot his father. Her husband was not making any demonstration as if to hurt Stepp at the time. When Stepp shot her son, he started to run back towards the house, and her husband ran towards him. The witness went to her son, and, about that time she heard the gun fire again. She looked around, and saw her husband on his knees. As soon as Stepp could load the gun again she heard another shot, and her husband fell on his face. She went to him, but he was not able to ■speak; Her husband never made a move or said a word after he was shot. Her husband was not armed when he started towards Mr. Stepp. In a short time the defendant came back for the horses, and the witness said, “Mr. <a id="p1064" href="#p1064" data-label="1064" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1064</a>Stepp, I’m afraid you’ll have to punish for this.” He said, “If I do, you’ll never know anything about it.” Noble was shot under the right arm with a single-barrel shotgun, No. 12 gauge. He lived something like an hour after he was shot, but her husband died instantly after he was shot the second time.</p>

Their home was -situated a quarter and a half-quarter from the hayfield. After Stepp started to running the mower in the hayfield, the witness heard her husband and son talking. They said that they were not going to let him cut the hay, because he had rented it to them. When she first saw Mr. Stepp and her husband fighting, they had nothing in their hands, and Noble was- just standing there looking on. She saw her husband knock Mr. Stepp down, and then saw Mr. Stepp knock her husband down. Neither one of them had-any weapons. They were just fighting with their fists.

He was then asked what Noble was doing when he was shot, and replied that he did not see that he was doing anything. He was then asked if Noble was armed in any way, and answered, “No sir, not that I seen. ” In a few minutes after the defendant shot Noble Piety, he sjiot the father of the boy twice. The witness was hoeing cotton at the time the defendant shot Noble Piety and his father. On cross-examination, he said that the whole hayfield was between him and the scene of difficulty, and the witness stated that he could not see whether Noble had anything in his hands or not.</p>

After Stepp and Everett-Piety stopped fighting with their fists, Stepp came towards him and asked him to go after Will iWeaver, who was also a tenant on the farm. Everett Piety told the witness if he knew which side his bread was buttered on he would not go. The witness then started to take a short cut to where his brother was, and Mrs. Piety forbade him to go across the hayfield. The witness then had to go around the field to get to where Will Weaver and his brother were. After the fist fight, Stepp started to run, and Everett Piety chased him with a hoe, and struck him in the back with it after he had started running. Stepp had lived in their house for several weeks, and knew where the gun was kept.</p>

Some days before the defendant commenced mowing the hay, Everett Piety said to him, “Bill, if you are figuring on cutting that hay next week, you had better bring your coffin along with you. ’ ’ On the morning in question, after the defendant had completed about three rounds with the mower in the hayfield in question, Everett Piety and his son came up and stopped his team. The defendant attempted to start his team, but they stopped it again, and said, “Stepp, what do you God damned sons of bitches mean by cutting this hay?” The defendant then told Piety that there was no use of having any trouble, and proposed to go with them to see Mr. Woosley about who the hay belonged to, and then Everett Piety hit the defendant and knocked him down, and Noble said to his father, “Take this hoe and let’s kill the God damned son of a bitch.” Both'of them ran after the defendant across the cottonfield, and, while he was still running, struck him once. • When the witness went to the house he saw the gun on the rack, and started back with it, intending to defend himself if they attacked him while he was getting his horses. When he got back the two men had their hoes, and he told them to let him alone, that he was going to get his team and go home. He made an effort to pick up the lines with his foot, and Piety said to his son, “When he picks up them lines, cut him in two.” Mrs. Piety said, “Go ahead and do what your pa says.” The boy struck at the witness with his hoe, but missed him. The boy stepped around the team, to strike the witness a second time, when the witness' shot him. The witness then unbreeched his gun and loaded it, and saw the elder Piety coming towards him. He turned and ran, with Piety after him.' When he saw that Piety was gaining on him, he shot him.

The witness came back to get his team and leave the place. Two of his ribs were fractured where one of the Pietys had struck him with a hoe. One of them also struck him with a hoe on the back of the head.

We have set out the substance of the testimony relied upon by the defendant to justify the killing, as well as the evidence for the State to support the verdict, in order to better get at the viewpoint of the jury. In arriving at its verdict, the jury is not required to accept or reject the whole of the testimony of a particular witness.

Moreover, the garments had been washed, and could have served no purpose whatever except to show where the shots had struck the body of Everett Piety. The undisputed evidence shows that he died instantly after being shot twice by the defendant. The defendant admitted the killing, and we cannot see how any prejudice whatever could have resulted to him from exhibiting the garments to the jury.

There has been a whole host of witnesses here in attendance on the court, brought here on account of this trial, and this case ought to be decided at this term of the court, at this time, if it can be done without any jurors doing’ violence to their consciences. I do not mean in anything I say to the jury that any juror should forego or give up any firm or fixed conviction or opinion he may have, but I am trying, the best I can, to impress upon you the importance of reaching a verdict in this case if you can do so without doing violence to your conscience. 'If you gentlemen don’t reach a verdict in this case, it simply means that this case must be tried again, and the same time consumed and the same expenses incurred here; the same witnesses brought back again that were brought here this time, and the same expenses incurred that have been incurred at this time, and everything done again that is done here now. I don’t know of any more reason why any twelve men selected from this district of this county should, be any more ready, willing and able to agree on a verdict in this case than you men. You, as reasonable men, should make an honest effort to arrive at a verdict. You should undertake to reason together as reasonable <a id="p1071" href="#p1071" data-label="1071" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1071</a>men'and to iron out and settle the differences of opinion, that exist between you. I realize, of course, that in a great majority of cases, when jurors go into the jury room, there are differences of opinion among them, but if you sit down and discuss those differences of opinion between, yourselves as reasonable men, having in mind the desire, and all having in mind the desire to reach a verdict in the case, you will, in a great majority of instances, be able to iron out your differences and arrive at some verdict. It is peculiarly within the province of the jury in cases of this kind to settle the case. There is no other way or manner provided by law for the disposition of this kind of a case except by a jury’s verdict, and they must be settled and decided by some jury some time or other. I am going to ask you to make an honest effort and undertake to reason together as reasonable men. If any man has an opinion about certain things, he should discuss that opinion with his fellow jurors and tell them his reasons for the opinions and views he has, based upon the law and the evidence in this case, and he should let the juror who has an adverse opinion tell his reasons for his opinion based upon the law and the evidence in this case, and then they should undertake, as reasonable men, to iron out the differences of their opinions, and try to arrive at some verdict. Criminal trials are always expensive, and the bigger the trial, the more time it takes, and the greater number of witnesses in attendance, the greater is the expense. I am going to ask you gentlemen, to go back to the jury room and, as reasonable men, undertake to reason together and iron -ujt your differences in this case and arrive at some vermut. I’ll pass back your forms of verdict to you and the instructions. If there is anything else you gentlemen desire or any other aid that might help you in this case —how do you stand with reference to numbers, without saying whether you are for the defendant or for conviction or acquittal? ' Don’t say, if you are divided that way, how you stand, except just with reference to numbers.”</blockquote>

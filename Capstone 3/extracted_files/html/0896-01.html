The substance behind those allegations is not in the record, but the District’s investigations are apparently ongoing and entering their fourth year. The District placed Predisik and Katke on administrative leave and has paid salaries to both employees while it investigates.</p>

Agencies can withhold a record only if it falls within one of the PRA’s specific, limited exemptions. RCW 42.56.070(1). These exemptions are narrow, and we apply them in favor of partial disclosure where possible since “the PRA’s purpose of open government remains paramount.” <em>Resident Action Council v.

The first question is not in dispute. The leave letter and spreadsheets, which identify Predisik and Katke by name, contain “ ‘personal information’ [i.e., the employees’ identities] because they relate to particular people.” <em>Id. </em>at 211.</p>

Employees must also demonstrate that they have a right to privacy in personal information contained in a record <em>and if such a right exists </em>that disclosure would violate it. The personal information at issue here is Predisik’s and Katke’s identities when they are contained in public records disclosing that the District is investigating allegations of misconduct. So we next must decide whether the PRA grants public employees under investigation a right to privacy in their identities.</p>
    <p id="b940-5" data-blocks='[["BL_940.6",940,[176,1506,1252,744]]]'>¶12 The statute’s text offers little guidance to answer this question.

We previously used principles of tort law to fill this definitional void and define the contours of the PRA’s privacy right. In <em>Hearst Corp. v. Hoppe, </em><a href="/wash-2d/90/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="90 Wash. 2d 123" data-case-ids="1104348" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/90/0123-01">90 Wn.2d 123</a>, 135, <a href="/citations/?q=580%20P.2d%20246" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="580 P.2d 246">580 P.2d 246</a> (1978), we concluded that the “right of privacy,” as it is used in the PRA, means “what it meant at common law,” and we adopted the definition in <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>§ 652D (Am. Law Inst. 1977) (§ 652D).</p>
    <p id="b940-6" data-blocks='[["BL_940.7",940,[179,2272,1249,100]],["BL_941.1",941,[132,349,1248,151]]]'>¶13 Therefore, a person has a right to privacy under the PRA only in “ ‘matter [s] concerning the private life.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at <a id="p905" href="#p905" data-label="905" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*905</a>135 (quoting § 652D). To explain how that standard is applied in practice, we looked to the Restatement’s summary of the right to privacy:</p>
    <blockquote id="b941-4" data-blocks='[["BL_941.5",941,[177,531,1204,432]]]'>“Every individual has some phases of his life and his activities and some facts about himself that he does not expose to the public eye, but keeps entirely to himself or at most reveals only to his family or to close personal friends. Sexual relations, for example, are normally entirely private matters, as are family quarrels, many unpleasant or disgraceful or humiliating illnesses, most intimate personal letters, most details of a man’s life in his home, and some of his past history that he would rather forget.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b941-5" data-blocks='[["BL_941.6",941,[129,1004,1252,415]]]'>
      <em>Id. </em>at 136 (quoting § 652D cmt. b at 386). This comment “illustrates <em>what nature of facts </em>are protected by this right to privacy,” <em>id. </em>(emphasis added), and taken in context makes clear that the PRA will not protect everything that an individual would prefer to keep private. The PRA’s “right to privacy” is narrower. Individuals have a privacy right under the PRA only in the types of “private” facts fairly comparable to those shown in the <em>Restatement.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b941-6" data-blocks='[["BL_941.7",941,[129,1438,1257,938]]]'>¶14 Using the <em>Restatement </em>as a rubric, we conclude that the PRA does not recognize a right of privacy in the mere fact that a public employer is investigating an employee. In so holding, we distinguish the investigation itself from the employee’s conduct giving rise to that investigation. This difference, though subtle, is very important to the Restatement’s privacy interest analysis. A public employer’s investigation is certainly not a <em>private </em>matter: it arises exclusively from the employee’s <em>public </em>employment. The investigation is simply an administrative process. It is not akin to a “ ‘family quarrel[ ]”’ or a “ ‘humiliating illness[ ],’ ” nor does it touch on the employee’s “ ‘life [at] home.’ ” <em>Id. </em>(quoting § 652D cmt. b at 386). To the contrary, the investigation relates to a part of the employee’s life — his or her profession — that is freely exposed to the public. A public employer’s investigation is an act of the government, not a closely held private matter that gives rise to a privacy right under the PRA.</p>

      <a id="p906" href="#p906" data-label="906" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*906</a>¶15 We again contrast the employer’s investigation, in which there is no privacy interest, with the allegations the employer is investigating. We acknowledge that such allegations may encompass some “past history that [the employee] would rather forget” and could come within that example or others in the <em>Restatement </em>that would implicate a privacy right under the PRA. But the mere fact there is an open investigation into allegations of misconduct is not, by itself, a reason to withhold a record from disclosure. Agencies and courts must review each responsive record and discern from its four corners whether the record discloses factual allegations that are truly of a private nature, using the <em>Restatement </em>as a guide. Though there is an inherent degree of fact-finding in this analysis, a record-specific inquiry is the only way to adhere to the PRA’s mandate that exemptions be construed narrowly. RCW 42.56.030.</p>
    <p id="b942-4" data-blocks='[["BL_942.5",942,[194,1242,1247,574]]]'>¶16 Applying this rule, we conclude that neither the leave letter nor the spreadsheets implicate a privacy right under the PRA. Those records disclose only that the District has opened an investigation and placed Predisik and Katke on leave during its pendency; the records do not disclose the factual allegations underlying that investigation. From these three records, the public learns only matters related to Predisik’s and Katke’s status as public employees and nothing about their personal lives. For the reasons we explain above, this information does not trigger a privacy interest under the PRA.</p>
    <p id="b942-5" data-blocks='[["BL_942.6",942,[193,1848,1248,521]]]'>¶17 Predisik and Katke argue our decision in <em>Bellevue John Does </em>requires we find a privacy interest here. We held in that case that teachers have a right to privacy in their identities in records related to unsubstantiated allegations, since in those instances “[t]he fact of the allegation ... does not bear on the teacher’s performance or activities as a public servant.” 164 Wn.2d at 215. But as we explained, the existence of a privacy right under the PRA depends on the types of facts disclosed and is not amenable to a bright-line rule.</p>

Again, a public employer’s investigation is a governmental act and a consequence of employment with the government. Unlike the records at issue in <em>Bellevue John Does, </em>the leave letter and spreadsheets do not disclose any salacious facts that one might consider a private matter. Indeed, the records contain no specific allegations of misconduct at all. It makes no difference if the allegations here are eventually substantiated because the records do not describe them.</p>
    <p id="b943-4" data-blocks='[["BL_943.5",943,[142,943,1250,521]]]'>¶19 We do not read <em>Bellevue John Does </em>to create a sweeping rule that exempts an employee’s identity from disclosure any time it is mentioned in a record with some tangential relation to misconduct allegations. A rule that broad would justify withholding, or at least redacting, nearly every record created during the course of the District’s investigation. Even <em>Bellevue John Does </em>recognizes the PRA entitles the public to “documents concerning the nature of the allegations and reports related to the investigation and its outcome.” <em>Id. </em>at 221.</p>
    <p id="b943-5" data-blocks='[["BL_943.6",943,[140,1485,1254,889]]]'> ¶20 Because we hold that no right of privacy exists in the leave letter or spreadsheets, we need not decide if disclosure of those records would violate that right. <em>See </em>RCW 42.56.050 (providing the test for determining when disclosure violates the right to privacy if such a right exists). We observe, however, that the public has a legitimate concern in the identities of public employees who are the subject of investigations. The PRA is meant to engender the people’s trust in their government. The recent unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, is an extreme example of how that trust is eroded when the public suspects the government is withholding information to protect its own. See, <em>e.g., </em>Tanzina Vega, Timothy Williams &amp; Erik Eckholm, <em>Emotions Flare in Missouri Amid Police Statements, </em>N.Y.

For example, if we accepted Predisik’s and Katke’s positions, the public would never learn about an investigation unless and until the underlying allegations are substantiated at some point in the future. There would be no opportunity for the public to discover the District’s ongoing three-year investigation, much less question the effectiveness of what some might consider an awfully long process. Government cannot be held accountable for actions it shields from the public’s eye.</p>
    <p id="b944-4" data-blocks='[["BL_944.5",944,[186,903,1248,577]]]'>¶22 Public employees are paid with public tax dollars and, by definition, are servants of and accountable to the public. The people have a right to know who their public employees are and when those employees are not performing their duties. In sum, we hold there is no privacy right under the PRA in the mere fact that a public employer is investigating a public employee or in the employee’s use of administrative leave. Both are simply functions of the government. Without such a privacy right, RCW 42.56-.230(3) does not apply to exempt the leave letter or spreadsheets from disclosure.</p>

We generally agree. However, we can uphold both the privacy interest of the Employees and the public’s interest in overseeing government actions by redacting the records. There is no evidence that the Employees were not performing their duties. <em>See Bellevue John Does, </em>164 Wn.2d at 217 (“ ‘[T]he public as a rule has no legitimate interest in finding out the names of people who have been falsely accused.’ ” (quoting <em>Bellevue John Does v.

    <p id="b954-6" data-blocks='[["BL_954.7",954,[192,1251,1247,636]]]'>¶49 I would affirm the Court of Appeals. The Employees who are the subjects of unsubstantiated allegations and pending investigations have a right to privacy in their identities. This right is violated if the records at issue are disclosed in their entirety to the public. However, if the identities of the Employees are redacted from the records, the Employees will not have a right to privacy in the records. Therefore, the records should be redacted and released. Because the majority finds that the Employees do not have a right to privacy in their identities and holds that the records at issue be disclosed in their entirety, I respectfully dissent.</p>

Thus when a railroad company authorizes an agent to sell tickets <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>over its line, sncli agent has authority and it is his duty, upon application made to him, to furnish information to persons desiring to purchase tickets over the road he represents as to the proper trains upon which to travel, and whether such trains will stop1 at the station to which the ticket is sold, and other like information regarding the use of the ticket. It is also the duty of the carrier to give a passenger reasonable notice of the necessity for changing cars at .junction points.” 4 R. C. L. 1068.</p>

In such case, if the agent of the carrier gives erroneous information which results in damage to the person applying for information, the carrier is liable if its negligence is the proximate cause of the injury. <em>St. Louis S.

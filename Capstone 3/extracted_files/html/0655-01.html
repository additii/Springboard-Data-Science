The undisputed testimony shows that S. P. Murphy and Jane Spurlock executed the contract in question, and that it was done in consideration of their approaching marriage, which occurred shortly thereafter. It is not claimed that there was any fraud or undue influence used in the negotiations about the agreement or in the execution thereof; and it <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>was entered into in good faith for the purposes set out therein, and the parties lived together as husband and wife until the death of the husband.</p>

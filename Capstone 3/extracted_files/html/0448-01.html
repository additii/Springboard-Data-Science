The validity of the contract is not attacked on that ground in the pleadings, and it does not appear, from the recitals of thé decree, that the chancellor passed on that question, but it is debated by both sides in the briefs, and we must assume that it was treated as an issue below.</p>

The contract itself recites reasons which are sufficient to make the specified time reasonable, and therefore the differences in time as to the contract in other cases referred to do not afford sufficient reason for holding that the consideration failed because of the additional length of time given for beginning operations.

We are of the opinion, however, that those cases are not decisive of the present controversy, for the reason that the contract contains -an express agreement with respect to the time within which drilling operations are to be commenced. The clause hereinbefore quoted expressly provides that, upon failure to commence operations within five years, the lease may be kept in force for a further period of two years by the payment of rentals, and this necessarily means that the full period of five years is given for the commencement of such operations.</p>

Operations were begun within the time on other lands within the specified distance, and the terms of the contract in that respect were complied with, but the operations were not continued, and there was a delay of eight years, up to the commencement of the suit, without any further operations, and none whatever on the land in controversy. The court held that there was an implied covenant that the operations should not only be commenced within the time specified,'but that such operations should be continued with reasonable diligence, and that there was a forfeiture on account of the unreasonable delay.

The demand was due to the tax purchaser, who was under no duty, statutory or otherwise, to receive anything except- lawful money; indeed, § 10,100, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, recognizes this right of the purchaser and gives its- sanction to be paid in money. When the sale is to the State, it is for the benefit of all the taxing agencies entitled to portions of the taxes, and the redemption is also for their benefit. It is, at last and in effect, a delayed payment of the taxes, which the law has permitted to be made, and the county then has no more right to refuse to accept its warrants in payment of its taxes than it originally had. It was still a demand due the county which the Constitution and the statutes of the State provide may be paid in the warrants of the county.</p>

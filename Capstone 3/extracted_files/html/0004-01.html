S. Christian, W. W. Mitchell and Claude Duty. The members of the State Highway Commission and the surety upon the separate bonds of the commissioners were made parties to each of these suits. There is some confusion as to the record in the case, as the cases were consolidated for the purpose of trial. Answers were filed by all of the defendants, to which the State demurred, but the demurrers were overruled only as to the answers filed by the commissioners and their surety. The State elected to stand upon the demurrers which had been overruled, and the causes were dismissed as to the highway commissioners and their surety, and this appeal is from that judgment. The trial court does not appear to have disposed of the demurrers to the answers of Christian, Mitchell and Duty, and the causes of action against these defendants are still pending in the court below, although a brief was filed by Duty on the question of his liability, and we were <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>thus led to believe that the question of liability of all the defendants was before us for decision, and we proceeded to decide it. As the causes against Duty and Christian and Mitchell are not before us, we withdraw the opinion as originally handed down and limit our decision to the liability of the commissioners and their surety.</p>
    <p id="b24-4" data-blocks='[["BL_24.4",24,[291,665,1202,639]]]'>The complaints alleged that Christian, who was the State Highway Engineer, and Mitchell, who was a district highway engineer, and Duty who was an Assistant Attorney General of the State, had each been paid certain sums of money as “living expenses,” in excess of their lawful salaries, and that these payments were made under the authority and direction of the members of the State Highway Commission, which action by the Commission was unauthorized by law and was in violation of the official duties of the'Commissioners. Upon this allegation the Commissioners and the surety upon the official bond of each Commissioner were made party defendants in each suit.</p>
    <p id="b24-5" data-blocks='[["BL_24.5",24,[288,1327,1201,292]]]'>The answers admit that certain sums of money were paid to Christian, Mitchell and Duty in excess of their fixed salaries, but alleged that this excess was paid by way of expenses, to retain their services, upon the assumption by the Commission that they possessed this authority.</p>
    <p id="b24-6" data-blocks='[["BL_24.6",24,[279,1633,1206,800]],["BL_25.1",25,[176,328,1202,349]]]'>The essential allegations of the pleadings are to the following effect: Christian resided in Texarkana, Mitchell in Fort Smith, and Duty in Rogers. These men were first employed — all of them — at salaries authorized by law, but they represented to the Commission that they could not continue the discharge of their respective duties unless they were allowed their living expenses in Little Rock. It was the unanimous opinion of the Highway Commission that the increased compensation demanded did not exceed the value of the services being rendered and thereafter to be rendered, but the question of the power of the Commission under the law to make the allowance arose, and a written request was submitted to H. W. Applegate, then the Attorney General of the State, for an opinion on the subject. A written opinion was rendered by the Attorney General’s office in response <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>to this request, which was signed “H. W. Applegate, Attorney General, By Claude Duty, Assistant Attorney General.” After a short review of the question, the opinion concluded with the statement that: “It is clearly my opinion that such action as mentioned in your letter is within the powers' and within the legal rights of the Highway Commission to do, and you are. so advised. ’ ’</p>
    <p id="b25-4" data-blocks='[["BL_25.4",25,[179,682,1201,551]]]'>Thereafter the Highway Commission directed the payment monthly, to each of the three employees, of a sum equal to the estimated living expenses of such employees, while resident in Little Rock. This was in addition to their traveling expenses while engaged in the discharge of their respective duties. The right and power to pay the actual and necessary traveling expenses in the discharge of official duties is not questioned. The question for decision is the right to pay “living expenses in Little Rock,” and the liability of the respective parties for an unauthorized payment on that account.</p>

We therefore conclude that the Attorney <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>General was in error in the opinion furnished the Highway Commission to the effect that the salaries might be supplemented by the payment of “living expenses,” in addition to the salaries, and we are of this opinion notwithstanding the allegation of the answers, which the demurrers admit, that the services of these employees, or of others equally efficient, could not otherwise have been obtained.</p>

The law did not require that the members of the Highway Commission be learned in the law, and the answers alleged that none of them were lawyers. They were all called from other walks of life, and, in order that they might be advised as to their duties and as to the limitations upon their authority and powers, a law officer was designated to act as their adviser. They did not act until they had sought this advice, and the action taken accorded with the advice given. It is not contended that the Highway Commissioners acted wilfully, maliciously or corruptly; nor is it contended that they derived any profit or benefit personally from the advice asked and given.</p>

In that case the facts were that a board of school directors, without authority of law, had purchased and operated an automobile truck for the purpose of carrying children to and from school. It was held in <em>Hendrix </em>v. <em>Morris, </em><a href="/ark/127/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="127 Ark. 222" data-case-ids="1550275" data-case-paths="/ark/127/0222-01">127 Ark. 222</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20S.W.%20949" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="191 S.W. 949">191 S.

The facts there were that the board of commissioners of a levee district let a contract to construct a levee, and later amended the contract to provide for increased compensation to the contractor. It was there held that this action was, not only not allowed by law, but was prohibited by the Constitution of the State, yet it was also held that, as the members of the board had acted within the- scope of their general jurisdiction and in good faith, without fraud or corruption, they were not individually liable for the increased compensation which they had unlawfully paid. It was there said: “Equally is it to be said that when we create boards and commissions and invest them with high duties and powers towards the accomplishment of great public objects, if we are to subject them to actionable liability for errors of decision and judgment and cast their estates in ruin, although they acted within their jurisdiction and in good faith, we will have only insolvents in office, or else those who will be so fearful of disaster to their private fortunes and the safety of their families that the rule of their conduct will be that of nonaction or of action so feeble and halting and cautious, their performances so paralytic of the vigor of decision, that they would become little more than objects of commiseration and at last of contempt.”</p>

The facts there were that the mayor and council of the then town of Russellville appropriated a thousand dollars of the town’s funds to build a county courthouse, and certain taxpayers of the town brought suit to enjoin the payment of this money, and to recover the part thereof already paid out. The relief prayed was granted, but, in granting the relief the court said: “As against the liability of these defendants, it is contended that a city council being in some sort a legislative body, its members are not liable for the erroneous exercise of their discretion in voting upon measures before them. This is true. [Citing cases.] But where, after exercising their discretion in voting <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>$1,000 of the money of the town, to pay an obligation which they and a few others had bound themselves to discharge, they or their building committee <em>took the money, </em>it was a conversion of trust funds, for which each of them, as also the mayor who ordered, and the treasurer who made, the payment, are liable.” [Citing cases.]</p>

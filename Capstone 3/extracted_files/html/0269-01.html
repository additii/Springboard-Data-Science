Laws of 2010, ch. 118 (codified at RCW 4.24.525). In the statute’s prefatory findings, the legislature explained it was “concerned about lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,” <em>id. </em>§ l(l)(a), and so the statute’s purpose was to establish “an efficient, uniform, and comprehensive method for speedy adjudication” of such lawsuits, <em>id. </em>§ l(2)(b).</p>

It halts discovery in such cases presumptively, RCW 4.24.525(5)(c), creates a “special motion to strike a claim” (anti-SLAPP motion), <em>id. </em>at (4)(b), and awards a prevailing party on the motion attorney fees and a $10,000 assessment, <em>id. </em>at (6)(a). When ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion, the trial court first determines whether the claim at issue is “based on an action involving public participation and petition,” a defined term that broadly describes rights of expression and petition. <em>Id. </em>at (4)(b). If that is so, the trial court then decides whether the party bringing the claim can prove by “clear and convincing evidence a probability of prevailing on the claim.” <em>Id. </em>If the party cannot meet that burden, the statute requires the trial court to dismiss the claim and award statutory remedies to the opposing party. <em>Id. </em>at (6)(a).</p>

Laws of 1989, ch. 234 (codified as amended at RCW 4.24.500-.520). This initial statute grants speakers immunity from claims based on the speaker’s communication to a governmental entity regarding any matter reasonably of concern to the governmental entity. <em>See </em>RCW 4.24.510. However, this statute has come to be seen as having a limited effect because it applies only to communications to governmental entities and it creates no method for early dismissal.

      <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>¶6 In 2010, the legislature enacted the anti-SLAPP statute at issue in this case. Laws of 2010, ch. 118 (codified at RCW 4.24.525). This statute is unique from its predecessor in that it creates an entirely new method for adjudicating SLAPPs, separate from the rules of civil procedure. The new statute did not amend or repeal the prior statute and instead codifies its new procedures in one new statutory section. <em>See </em>RCW 4.24.525. Subsections (1) and (2) define key terms. Subsection (3) provides that the law does not apply to prosecutors. Subsection (4) is the law’s mainspring: it establishes a “special motion to strike a claim” and sets forth the evidentiary standard that trial courts must use to adjudicate the motion. Subsection (5) contains various procedural rules to halt discovery and ensure speedy adjudication of an anti-SLAPP motion. Subsection (6) provides the prevailing party on the motion statutory damages of $10,000, attorney fees, costs, and discretionary additional relief. Subsection (7) states the statute does not abridge any other rights the movants possess.</p>

That phrase — “an action involving public participation and petition” — is a defined term that uses capacious language in five nonexclusive examples. <em>See id. </em>at (2)(a)-(e). When a party brings such a motion, the moving party has “the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence” that the claim is based on an action involving public participation and petition. <em>Id. </em>at (4)(b). If the moving party meets this burden, the burden shifts to the responding party “to establish by clear and convincing evidence a probability of prevailing on the claim.” <em>Id. </em>When a trial judge adjudicates such a motion, “the court shall consider pleadings and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.” <em>Id. </em>at (4)(c).

The motion must be filed within 60 days of service of the most recent complaint or at a later time in the court’s discretion. <em>Id. </em>at (5)(a). The court must hold a hearing on the motion within 30 days, unless “the docket conditions of the court require a later hearing” and, regardless, the court “is directed” to hold the hearing “with all due speed and such hearings should receive priority.” <em>Id. </em>The court must render its decision “as soon as possible,” but no later than seven days after the hearing. <em>Id. </em>at (5)(b). Every party has a “right of expedited appeal” from the trial court’s order granting the motion, the trial court’s order denying the motion, or the trial court’s “failure to rule on the motion in a timely fashion.” <em>Id. </em>at (5)(d).</p>

That policy, adopted by the board in 1993, provides that the Cooperative “will honor nationally recognized boycotts” when the staff “decide [s] by consensus” to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 106. Because the board adopted the boycott of Israel-based companies without staff consensus, the complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the boycott was void, a permanent injunction of the boycott, and an “award of damages in an amount to be proved at trial.” <em>Id. </em>at 17. Defendants responded that the board’s inherent authority to govern the Cooperative under its bylaws and the Washington Nonprofit Corporation Act, RCW 24.03-.095, authorized the adoption of the boycott without staff consensus, notwithstanding the boycott policy.</p>

The anti-SLAPP statute provides a burden of proof concerning whether the evidence crosses a certain threshold of proving a likelihood of prevailing on the claim. <em>See </em>2 McCormick on Evidence § 336 (Kenneth S. Brown ed., 7th ed. 2013) (comparing burdens of production and burdens of proof). But summary judgment does not concern degrees of likelihood or probability. Summary judgment requires a legal certainty: the material facts must be undisputed, and one side wins as a matter of law. If the legislature intended to adopt a summary judgment standard, it could have used the well-known language of CR 56(c). But it did not do so. It instead chose language describing the evidentiary burden to evaluate the “probability of prevailing on the claim.” RCW 4.24.525(4)(b).

If the trial court determines the responding party has met its burden to establish by clear and convincing evidence a probability of prevailing on the claim, “the substance of the determination may not be admitted into evidence at any later stage of the case.” RCW 4.24.525(4)(d)(i). Under defendants’ theory — wherein all the responding party must do to defeat a special motion to strike is show a disputed material fact — subsection (4)(d)(i) would mean the mere fact that there <em>is </em>a triable issue of fact cannot be admitted into evidence. That makes little sense. By contrast, under plaintiffs’ reading, subsection (4)(d)(i) has meaning. The legislature’s apparent concern expressed in subsection (4)(d)(i) is that a jury at trial might give undue weight to a trial judge’s factual finding that the plaintiff’s claim establishes by clear and convincing evidence a probability of prevailing on the merits. Given that we harmonize related provisions in a statute whenever possible, <em>State v.

In turn, plaintiffs counter with other nonbinding authorities to the contrary. We are cautious in looking beyond our state’s statute, however, because among the slight majority of states that have adopted an anti-SLAPP statute, the details of these statutes vary significantly. <em>See </em>Thomas R.

It is true that some provisions of the Waslxington anti-SLAPP statute and the California statute resemble or are identical to each other. <em>Compare </em>RCW 4.24.525, <em>with </em><a href="/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20425.16" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="Cal.

Wyrwich, <em>supra, </em>at 671-92 (discussing some of the similarities and differences between the two statutes and concluding that because Washington modeled its statute on California’s, Washington courts must give effect to the differences in our anti-SLAPP statute); <em>see also </em><a href="/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20425.17" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="Cal.

And the relevant provisions of the two statutes at issue — their burden of proof standards — are notably different. California’s statute provides that a plaintiff defeats a defendant’s motion by establishing <em>“a probability </em>that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.” <a href="/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20425.16" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="Cal.

By contrast, our statute expressly ratchets up the plaintiff’s evidentiary burden, requiring the plaintiff to establish “by <em>clear and convincing evidence a probability </em>of prevailing on the claim.” RCW 4.24.525(4)(b) (emphasis added). Where our legislature borrows a statute from another source but makes certain deviations from that source, “we are bound to conclude” the legislature’s deviation “was purposeful and evidenced its intent” to differ from the original source on the particular issue. <em>State v.

Instead, the court has found unconstitutional only serious deprivations or punishments of petitioning activity, such as the enjoinment of the suit in <em>Bill Johnson’s Restaurants </em>or imposition of substantive liability in the <em>Noerr/Pennington </em>cases. Whatever the precise contours of the line, RCW 4.24.525(6)(a) doubtlessly falls on the impermissible side that punishes the exercise of the right to petition. In addition to attorney fees and cost shifting, the statute assesses a statutory penalty of $10,000 (potentially to each movant, as in this case below, where $160,000 was awarded in total to the 16 movants) and “[s]uch additional relief... as the court determines to be necessary to deter repetition of the conduct and comparable conduct by others similarly situated.” RCW 4.24.525(6)(a)(iii). This is harsh punishment for bringing what may be a nonfrivolous claim, albeit one that cannot show by clear and convincing evidence a probability of succeeding at trial.</p>

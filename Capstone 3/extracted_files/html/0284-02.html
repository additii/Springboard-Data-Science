And maintaining this one, it follows that it was not improper for the plea before us to pray judgment both of the declarationsand the <em>writ; </em>inasmuch as the matter set up in it, went to the entire proceedings, and not to so much of it, merely, as was a proceeding, <em>in rem; </em>the same having been presented by plea in abatement, verified by affidavit, interposed before common appearance to the action, and within the time allowed by the ordinary rules of law for interposing dilatory defences in every form of action.</p>

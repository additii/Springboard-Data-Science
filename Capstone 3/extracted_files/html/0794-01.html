In order to provide a lay jury with the best possible understanding of this fundamental, yet often confusing, component of legal liability, supplemental standard of care instructions are sometimes used in addition to the basic instructions. One of these supplemental instructions is the exercise of judgment instruction, which reminds juries that if a physician exercises the reasonable care and skill generally required by his or her position, just choosing between alternate treatments or diagnoses does not make them legally liable for making a wrong choice.</p>

During trial, he testified as to his use of clinical judgment during his thought process that day, including why he believed it to be a cyst and why he ordered certain tests.

Fergen says Sestero simply diagnosed it as a benign cyst without considering other diagnoses or doing anything to confirm or disprove that the lump was benign and thus there is no evidence of a conscious choice. Sestero countered that his diagnosis of a benign cyst inherently involved the exercise of clinical judgment since selection of one diagnosis necessarily entails the rejection of other possible, less likely, diagnoses.</p>

The plaintiff must prove the health care provider failed to exercise the “care, skill, and learning expected of a reasonably prudent health care provider.” RCW 7.70.040(1).

The jury’s thought process inheres in its verdict. But, it is important to recognize the risk of confusion this instruction presents in any medical negligence case, including these. The majority cannot elucidate a workable rule for a trial judge to decide when the risk of giving this instruction is too great. The majority acknowledges that we have said the instruction must be given “ ‘with caution.’ ” Majority at 805 (quoting <em>Watson, </em>107 Wn.2d at 165). It explains that this court has attempted to limit the introduction of the instruction to “situations where the doctor uses judgment to choose between alternative treatments or diagnoses.” <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Miller </em>III, 91 Wn.2d at 160). But at the same time, the majority characterizes this requirement as one that must be broadly construed, suggesting it is “a low bar that must be satisfied for the court to hold that a physician made a choice between treatments or diagnoses.” <em>Id. </em>at 807. Nothing more must be shown than that the health care provider was engaged in an “ ‘exercise of professional judgment’ in treatment or diagnosis.” <em>Id. </em>at 808 (quoting <em>Miller </em>III, 91 Wn.2d at 160). The <em>Miller </em>III court acknowledged that the exercise of professional judgment is simply a physician practicing medicine. 91 Wn.2d at 160 (“The exercise of professional judgment is an inherent part of the care and skill involved in the practice of medicine.”).

Such instructions do not undermine the proper statements of the law in the basic instructions, but they overemphasize one party’s point of view.

      <p id="b859-6" data-blocks='[["BL_859.7",859,[151,2077,1255,297]]]'> I do not agree with Appukuttan’s suggestion that RCW 7.70.030 and .040 “preempt” WPI 105.08 or that the instruction is inconsistent with the statute. <em>See </em>Br. of Appellant (Appukuttan) at 11-18. My point is simply that the codification of the elements of a medical negligence claim reinforces the value of limiting jury instructions to those that provide the legal framework for the jury’s deliberations. <em>See Laudermilk, </em>78 Wn.2d at 100 (cautioning against giving instructions “other than those which enunciate the basic and essential elements of the legal rules necessary for a jury to reach a verdict”).</p>

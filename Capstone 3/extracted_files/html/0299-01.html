We must now determine how to value the damages suffered by that group of employees when they were denied health benefits. The State argues that the only damages to the employees were immediate medical expenses paid by employees during the time they were denied health benefits. But evidence shows that people denied health care benefits suffer additional damage. They often avoid going to the doctor for preventive care, and they defer care for medical problems. This results in increased long-term medical costs and a lower quality of life. Based on this evidence, the trial court correctly rejected the State’s limited definition of “damages” because it would significantly understate the damages suffered by the employees. We affirm.</p>

Instead, the employees proposed three alternative methods of measuring damages. First, the employees argued that the health benefits were part of the employees’ compensation, so the damages should be based on the employees’ lost wages (i.e., the amount the State should have paid to provide health benefits to those employees). Second, the employees argued that the court could measure damages based on how much money the State unlawfully retained by failing to provide health benefits to those employees. Third, the employees argued that the court could measure dámages as the amount that the State would have paid in health care costs for the group of employees had they been covered. The employees argue that the most accurate measure of this cost is to use an actuarial method based on the average health care costs for a comparable group of state employees with health benefits. They presented evidence that this method would be more accurate than the one proposed by the State because it would take into account the fact that people postpone medical care when they do not have health insurance.</p>

We disagree. The State’s measure relies on the assumption that the only damages suffered by those denied health benefits are out-of-pocket expenses incurred during the time period they were denied benefits — an assumption that is contradicted by both common sense and the evidence in the record. The State also argues that its proposed measure is the only one allowed by law based on non-health-insurance case law in Washington and certain out-of-state cases. Because the reasoning in those cases does not apply to this case, we disagree with the State’s conclusion. Finally, the State argues that the employees must establish the damages to each class member through an individual claims process. Because such a process would be counter to the goals underlying a class action, including efficiency, deterrence, and access to justice, the trial court was correct to reject this argument.</p>

    <p id="b348-4" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[198,762,1252,756]]]'>¶13 The primary flaw in this underlying assumption is that it refuses to acknowledge that those who are wrongfully denied health benefits suffer damage even if they do not incur direct out-of-pocket medical expenses during that particular time period. In its ruling, the trial court pointed to studies showing that people who do not have health insurance do not obtain routine preventive care, which results in deferred medical problems. More significantly, studies show that those without health benefits even put off necessary care for urgent medical issues. Based on these studies, the trial court concluded that the State’s method of calculating damages would result in a “great understatement” of the actual damages.

A highly experienced actuary explained that the method proposed by the State would “significantly underestimate the loss to the class here because it would fail to take into account both the deferred <em>costs </em>due to delayed care and the economic loss in for[ ]going a healthier and longer life.” CP at 157. That expert pointed out that the study cited by the State’s expert as “ ‘the best available evidence on the costs of being uninsured in the United States’ ” actually concluded that “ ‘the economic value of the healthier and longer life that an uninsured child or adult forgoes because he or she lacks health insurance ranges between $1,645 and $3,280 for each additional year spent without coverage.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 156-57.

This leap of logic simply repeats the same mistake described above. While some members of the class did not (or could not) obtain health insurance and avoided or deferred direct health care expenses at the time that they were uninsured, the undisputed evidence on the record shows that such individuals still suffered long-term damages from the lack of health benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 10:2, at 479 (4th ed. 2002). The facts of this case make it particularly suitable for using aggregate proof of damages. First, the employees’ expert explained that the number of total class members is large enough to be able to statistically estimate their health care costs by comparing the group with state employees who did receive health benefits (controlling for any demographic differences). Second, the time period covered by the class action is from 2009 and before, which means it will be very difficult for many class members to produce records of <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>medical expenses. They may have had no reason to retain medical records from so long ago, particularly those with small expenses and those who did not know that they were wrongfully denied health benefits. The employees’ expert also indicated that the employees may have difficulty obtaining such records from their providers, who “may have moved, merged, gone out of business, had billing records destroyed, or have difficulties in obtaining the old documentation.” CP at 159. Earlier, the State acknowledged that obtaining such information from a class of thousands of people “ 'would be unmanageable and unduly burdensome.’ ” <em><a href="/citations/?q=267%20P.3d%20998" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="267 P.3d 998">Id.</a> </em>Class members with small claims would be unlikely to pursue their claims, and of course, absent class members would automatically be deemed to have no damages. These results defeat the purpose of a class action, which is to provide relief for large groups of people with the same claim, particularly when each individual claim may be too small to pursue. <em>See Scott v.

As a result, the trial court properly rejected this method in this case. However, that does not mean that such a method could never be used to value health benefits. Instead, we defer to trial courts to determine the best measure of damages <em>depending on the facts of the case. </em>For instance, consider a case involving an individual who was unlawfully fired and purchased substitute health insurance but was unable to obtain health insurance at as low a cost as the employer could have. Under such circumstances, a trial court could reasonably find that the most accurate measure of damages to that individual is the cost of purchasing substitute health insurance. But such a one-size-fits-all measure is not appropriate for every situation. Valuing health benefits, and particularly valuing the damage from denying health benefits to a large group of people, is a complex matter that depends on facts of the particular situation. As described below, measuring damages exclusively through out-of-pocket expenses is highly inaccurate in this particular case, and thus we affirm the trial court’s decision to reject it.

    <p id="b353-5" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[122,764,1254,478]]]'> ¶21 The employees proposed three methods of measuring damages: (1) measuring damages as the amount the State should have paid to provide the health benefits because the failure to provide health benefits was a failure to pay wages, (2) measuring damages as the amount the State unlawfully retained by failing to provide health benefits to those employees, or (3) measuring damages as the amount that the State would have paid in health care costs for the group of employees had they been covered.</p>
    <p id="b353-6" data-blocks='[["BL_353.6",353,[123,1265,1254,638]]]'>¶22 The trial court did not select a particular method of damages in its ruling; however, it did generally support the first two methods proposed by the employees by agreeing that a failure to provide health care benefits is a failure to pay wages and that the State received a windfall by failing to provide the health benefits. Nonetheless, the trial court found that “huge factual issues” remained, including how many class members would likely have opted out of coverage and which level of coverage the class members would likely have chosen. VRP (Oct. 26, 2012) at 46. Because factual issues remained, the trial court concluded that summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>

That is probably because treating the State’s failure to pay health benefits as a failure to pay wages (and measuring damages as the value of those lost wages) is well grounded in the law. In this case, the State <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>was found to have violated RCW 41.05.050(1) for failing to provide the proper contributions for health benefits for this class of employees. In light of that, it is reasonable to estimate the damages as the contributions the State should have paid to provide health benefits for the employees. The trial court pointed to <em>Cockle v. Department of Labor &amp; Industries, </em><a href="/wash-2d/142/0801-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="142 Wash. 2d 801" data-case-ids="1361324" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/142/0801-01">142 Wn.2d 801</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20P.3d%20583" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="16 P.3d 583">16 P.3d 583</a> (2001), for support, where this court had faced an analogous situation in the workers’ compensation context:</p>
    <blockquote id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[237,861,1206,480]]]'>[I]t is very clear to me that in Washington, if not in other places, that we view the right to healthcare benefits as a form of wages. I agree that <em>Cockle </em>is a workers compensation case, but I do not agree that <em>Cockle </em>is limited to wages in the workers compensation context. The <em>Cockle </em>Court looked very broadly at what wages are under Washington law, and the court expressly rejected any method that required a hypothetical calculation of market value. The Court in <em>Cockle </em>indicated that premiums actually paid by the employer to secure the benefit are going to be the best measurement for wages lost.</blockquote>
    <p id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[191,1380,1254,1003]]]'>VRP (Oct. 26, 2012) at 43. The State points out that the parties in <em>Cockle </em>stipulated that the amount paid by the employer for health benefits “fairly reflected the benefit’s value,” 142 Wn.2d at 820 n.10, and thus <em>Cockle </em>does not stand for the proposition that health benefits must be valued as the amount the employer should have paid toward providing the benefits. While the State is correct that <em>Cockle </em>does not stand for the proposition that this method <em>must </em>be used to value health benefits, it does stand for the proposition that such a measure <em>can </em>be used to value health benefits. As described above, we are not providing a one-size-fits-all measure for valuing health benefits in all circumstances; however, the “lost wages” method used in <em>Cockle </em>and generally supported by the trial court in this case is one lawful method of measuring the damage caused by the improper failure to provide health benefits. Therefore, the trial court did not favor an unlawful method of damages when it expressed support for using the lost wages method in this case.</p>

    <p id="b355-4" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[112,541,1251,1080]]]'>¶24 As briefly described above, the employees presented expert testimony that explained in detail why the methods proposed by the employees were more accurate than the method proposed by the State. The State did not rebut the fact that the employees’ methods are more accurate. The State cited a study showing that those without insurance have lower medical expenses than those with insurance but strikingly failed to acknowledge that — as explained by the employees’ expert — the same study showed that “the lower present expenses are directly correlated to <em>deferred costs and lost health and longevity </em>for the uninsured because <em>the lower expenses are due to the inability to access preventive services, timely care, and medical treatment.” </em>CP at 156 (emphasis added). The employees’ expert went on to explain that the study showed that “deferred care is often more expensive and less effective.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=16%20P.3d%20583" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="16 P.3d 583">Id.</a> </em>Yet, the State argues that the court should deny the existence of this type of scientifically demonstrated long-term damage and allow the class to recover only short-term economic damages. The trial court properly rejected this argument, and we do as well.</p>
    <p id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[113,1643,1250,582]]]'>¶25 People without health benefits are less likely to seek and obtain medical treatment, especially preventive care. This is true as a matter of common sense and as shown by the evidence in the record. The State would use this fact as a reason to use a <em>lower </em>estimate of the damage it caused to the employees to whom it improperly denied health benefits. But those lower short-term medical costs have significant long-term consequences, both medical and financial, to uninsured individuals. We see no error in the trial court’s decision to consider those long-term consequences in its damages calculation.</p>

The trial court refused to grant sum<a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>mary judgment to either side because additional information was needed on the likelihood that any members would have opted out of coverage (notably, a state employee can opt out of health coverage only if they have comparable health coverage from another source, WAC 182-12-128) and what level of coverage they likely would have chosen. As these additional facts are developed, the measure of damages proposed by the employees will become even more accurate.</p>

      <em>C. The Trial Court’s Decision Avoids a Windfall for the Wrongdoer</em>

    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[198,1013,1248,469]]]'>¶27 Both sides argue that the other side’s method for measuring damages would result in a windfall for that side. The employees contend that the State’s method would result in a windfall for the State because it would retain a significant portion of the money it should have paid to provide health benefits to the employees. The State argues that the employees’ method would result in a windfall for those employees who did not incur medical expenses during the time they were wrongfully denied health benefits.</p>
    <p id="b356-6" data-blocks='[["BL_356.6",356,[195,1502,1250,904]]]'> ¶28 First, since the methods proposed by the employees are the most accurate, they are the most likely to avoid a windfall for any party. But more importantly, “ ‘[t]he most elementary conceptions of justice and public policy require that the wrongdoer shall bear the risk of the uncertainty which his own wrong has created.’ ” <em>Wenzler &amp; Ward Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v.

Adopting the State’s method would not only result in a less accurate measure of damages, it would also result in the wrongdoer benefitting from its wrongdoing. Thus, we agree with the trial court’s decision to reject that method and support one of the methods proposed by the employees instead.

But the State confuses the method of calculating the aggregate damages class-wide with the method of distributing the damage award to members. Using the methods proposed by the employees will result in an accurate estimation of the class-wide damages; in contrast, the methods proposed by the State will significantly underestimate the class-wide damages. Once the award is made, the trial court will address how the award will be distributed. There are many distribution methods available to the court, some of which provide a mechanism for fairly compensating those with larger claims. But importantly, the trial court has not yet ruled on a distribution plan, and thus there is no basis on which to claim that certain class members will be undercompensated.</p>

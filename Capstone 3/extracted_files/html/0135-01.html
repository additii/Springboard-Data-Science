The contract shows that the small savings banks were to be used in the windows of the defendant for display advertising service. The defendant was engaged in the general banking business in Pine Bluff, Ark. The contract contemplated that the display-of savings banks should be changed twice a week and should be installed in a case in a window of the defendant’s place of business. The contract also contained the following, “No verbal agreements are binding on either party hereto.”</p>

The plaintiff asked the agent of the defendant if they had ever been sold to any other banking company in Pine Bluff prior to this time. The salesman replied'that they had not, and that they had never offered anything of the kind for' sale in Pine Bluff. The defendant relied upon this representation in purchasing- the display banks, and would not have purchased them if it had known that they had been sold to any other banking company in the city prior to this time. A few days after signing the order the defendant saw some of the same banks in the display windows of another banking company where they were being used for advertising purposes in the same way that the defendant intended to use them. The contract had been made with the People’s Savings Bank &amp; Trust <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>Company, for something over a year prior to the execution of the contract sued on.

To reverse the judgment, counsel for the plaintiff rely upon the rule laid down in <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em><a href="/ark/75/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="75 Ark. 206" data-case-ids="1502549" data-case-paths="/ark/75/0206-01">75 Ark. 206</a>, to the effect that where an order for goods sold stipulates that verbal or written agreements with salesmen shall not be binding on the seller, it is incompetent to prove as a defense,when <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>sued for the purchase price of the goods, that the plaintiff’s salesman agreed not to sell his goods to any other person in the city.</p>
    <p id="b162-3" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[281,549,1202,913]]]'>The contract sued on contained a stipulation that no verbal agreements should be binding on the parties. Under this stipulation the defendant could not, when sued for the purchase price of the display banks, prove as a defense that the plaintiff had agreed not to sell them to any other person in the city. That is not the issue, however, presented by the record in this case. The defense relied upon is that the contract was procured ¡by the fraudulent representations of the seller’s agent. The general rule is that representations of facts that will exist in the future, or which are promissory in their nature, though false, do not afford the basis of actionable fraud. To constitute actionable fraud in the sale of property, the representations must be of existing facts relating to the subject-matter of the contract made by the seller as an inducement to the contract, and such representations must be false and relied upon by the buyer in making the purchase to his damage..</p>

Co. </em>v. <em>Belleville Drug Co., <a href="/ark/75/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="75 Ark. 95" data-case-ids="1502491" data-case-paths="/ark/75/0095-01">75 </a></em><a href="/ark/75/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="75 Ark. 95" data-case-ids="1502491" data-case-paths="/ark/75/0095-01">Ark. 95</a>, the. court held actionable a misrepresentation that the plaintiff had not sold any goods of the class contracted for by. the defendant to any one in the same town before the contract sued on was made, when in fact it had already done so. That principle controls here, and the trial court was governed by it in giving its instructions to the jury. It is true that the sale was made by an agent of the plaintiff, but it is elementary that a principal is liable for the fraud of his agent perpetrated within the scope of his employment. The principal can not affirm the action of his agent in making a sale and not assume responsibility for his representations. The plaintiff employed the salesman to sell the display banks and is liable for any false and fraudulent representations made by its agent. It does not make any difference whether the agent knew the <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>representations to be false or not, if in fact they were false as to a material fact affecting the sale and induced the buyer to make the purchase.</p>

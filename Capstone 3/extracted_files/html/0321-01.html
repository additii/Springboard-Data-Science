Chapter 10.77 RCW, the statutory scheme that governs insanity acquittals, requires the trial court find that a conditionally released insanity acquittee violated the conditions of release or poses a threat to the public to revoke an insanity acquittee’s conditional release. Chapter 10.77 RCW does not require the trial court make a finding regarding the acquittee’s mental state at a conditional release revocation hearing.

The court found that Beaver suffered from a mental disease or defect and held that he posed a substantial danger to other persons and presented a substantial likelihood of committing criminal acts jeopardizing public safety or security unless kept under further control by the court. The court committed Beaver to Western State Hospital (WSH) and to the custody of the secretary of the Department of Social and Health Services (secretary).</p>

Because of these violations and because the trial court continued to find that Beaver was a danger to society, the terms of his conditional release were modified or revoked several times.</p>
    <p id="b369-4" data-blocks='[["BL_369.5",369,[201,636,1247,704]]]'>¶4 In 2011, Beaver petitioned for final discharge. WSH submitted a letter to the court recommending Beaver’s final discharge because WSH found that Beaver did not show signs or symptoms of mental illness that could not be explained by substance abuse. The Public Safety Review Panel (PSRP)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> reviewed Beaver’s treatment record, evaluations, and letters from the prosecuting attorney and Beaver’s defense counsel and opposed Beaver’s discharge. The State and Beaver obtained independent mental health evaluations. Brian Judd, PhD, for the State, opined that Beaver remained mentally ill and a threat to the community. Brendon Scholtz, PhD, for Beaver, recommended Beaver’s final discharge.</p>
    <p id="b369-5" data-blocks='[["BL_369.6",369,[202,1368,1247,374]]]'>¶5 In July 2011, a jury trial began on Beaver’s petition for final discharge. Before resting, Beaver voluntarily withdrew his petition. Beaver agreed that he continued to suffer from a mental illness that made him a threat to public safety—the criteria for a defendant who is not guilty by reason of insanity under RCW 10.77.110—and stipulated to an agreed order of conditional release.</p>
    <p id="b369-6" data-blocks='[["BL_369.7",369,[201,1769,1248,264]]]'>¶6 On conditional release, Beaver violated the terms by using cocaine, by drinking alcohol and driving a motor vehicle, and by being charged with the crime of driving under the influence of alcohol.

In fact, the first and only time that there was any discussion at the conditional release revocation hearing about Beaver’s mental disease or defect was when the trial judge, after stating that he would revoke, expressed concern about recommitting Beaver when WSH had earlier indicated Beaver no longer continued to suffer from a mental illness.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> However, the trial judge recognized there were contradictory opinions and his comments were not incorporated into the trial court’s findings.</p>
    <p id="b370-5" data-blocks='[["BL_370.4",370,[201,967,1247,484]]]'>¶8 Beaver appealed the trial court’s order revoking his conditional release, arguing that due process required a finding of current mental illness before the court could revoke his conditional release and recommit him to WSH. While this appeal was pending, Beaver filed a petition for final discharge under RCW 10.77.200(3). Based on agreement of the parties, Beaver was granted conditional release in October 2013. Then in May 2014, again based on agreement of the parties, Beaver was granted final discharge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

      <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>¶1 This case presents the issue of whether sidebar conferences implicate a criminal defendant’s right to a public trial under article I, section 22 of the Washington Constitution and require a conviction to be overturned. William Glen Smith claims that the trial court violated his public trial right when courtroom limitations led to holding sidebar conferences in a hallway outside the courtroom on the record with counsel present. Smith argues that these sidebars were courtroom closures subject to <em>State v. Bone-Club, </em><a href="/wash-2d/128/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="128 Wash. 2d 254" data-case-ids="518016" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/128/0254-01">128 Wn.2d 254</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=906%20P.2d%20325" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="906 P.2d 325">906 P.2d 325</a> (1995). Because the trial court did not perform a <em>Bone-Club </em>analysis, he requests that this court reverse his conviction and grant him a new trial.</p>

This court uses the experience and logic test to evaluate whether a particular proceeding implicates the public trial right. <em>State v.

Sidebars are not subject to the public trial right under the experience and logic test because they have not historically been open to the public and because allowing public access would play no positive role in the proceeding. Although the practice of holding sidebars in a hallway outside the courtroom is unusual, the form of these hallway conferences was consistent with the role traditionally filled by sidebars and so they do not implicate the public trial right. We affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>

Most problematically, we have resorted to the logic and experience test to reduce the right to a public trial, carving out exceptions to the public trial right for various steps in the trial.

In our earlier decisions, we assumed we could best protect the public trial right by allowing parties to raise the issue for the first time on appeal. <em>Paumier, </em>176 Wn.2d at 36-37. But requiring an objection has proved to be equally or even more protective of the public trial right. A contemporaneous objection permits the trial judge to resolve the issue when it should be resolved — at trial. An objection reminds the judge not to close any step in the trial process without engaging in a <em>Bone-Club </em>analysis. In other words, the objection protects the public trial right by forcing the trial judge to evaluate the issue and reassess whether to close a part of the trial or not. It puts the decision and the ability to establish a record in the hands of the defendant. In addition, our prior latitude in not requiring an objection is no longer needed because the many recent published decisions discussing the open trial right should have alerted most, if not all, defense counsel to the importance of the issue. It would be a rare defense attorney in Washington who remained unaware of the public trial right after our 14 opinions concerning the issue published since 2012. <em>See </em>Ellington &amp; Lutzenhiser, <em>supra, </em>at 497 (public trial issue so familiar that “Bone-Club” is now a verb in Washington courtrooms).</p>

And unfortunately, the logic and experience analysis fails the test. As the body of public trial case law expands, the larger database provides an increasingly clear demonstration of the logic and experience test’s shortcomings. Even “easy” applications of the test are no longer so easy, and the <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>more troublesome applications are only beginning to arise. These cases demonstrate the defects in the logic and experience test: the uncertainty of what constitutes “logic” and “experience” and the inability of the test to consistently protect against errors of constitutional import. We will continue to deal with confusion spawned by this test should we adhere to our precedent. For the sake of courts, victims, defendants, and public confidence, we should provide much needed guidance and reiterate that all phases of trial are presumed open and should not be closed without a <em>Bone-Club </em>analysis on the record. I concur in affirming the Court of Appeals, but I would so hold because Smith did not object at trial and he has not satisfied the requirements of RAP 2.5(a)(3).</p>

The majority concludes that “[n]othing is added to the functioning of the trial by insisting that the defendant or public be present” during the discussions at issue. Majority at 519. The majority reasons that defendants do not have a right to be present at all stages, and for the public, some legal discussions are “practically a foreign language.” <em><a href="/us/478/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="213" data-cite="478 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6203186" data-case-paths="/us/478/0001-01">Id.</a> </em>I disagree.

    <p id="b586-6" data-blocks='[["BL_586.6",586,[197,1199,1251,583]]]'>¶69 A public trial helps ensure that judges and lawyers are accountable for what occurs during trial. It helps remind them to act with decorum and to consider the consequences of their actions. Logically, this is perhaps most important during arguments over what evidence and testimony the jury will hear. Whether a key piece of evidence is admitted or not could decide the outcome of the entire trial. We should not allow attorneys and judges to make these important decisions in a back hallway, away from public scrutiny. The proper forum for argument on these issues is in open court.</p>

Logic indicates that hiding discussions over evidence and testimony in private will not further these goals. One can easily imagine a scenario where a party attempts to admit a key piece of evidence— the “smoking gun” — only to be met with an objection and a private conference where the judge determines that the evidence is inadmissible. The public is left wondering what happened to the smoking gun mentioned just moments ago and why the jury is being told to forget that it ever existed. <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>Logically, it follows that the public’s trust in our justice system will weaken.</p>

These observers may have met with the attorneys or have researched the law independently and are eager to hear the legal arguments that could decide the case. Additionally, many practitioners and students attend trials to learn and to see justice in action. We should not allow the trial court to obscure legal discussions from these observers.</p>

The underlying documents at issue are motions filed by M.H.P.’s parents to obtain public funding for expert services in connection with proceedings to terminate their parental rights. The court granted the motions ex parte without holding a hearing or providing notice to the other parties or to the public.

    <p id="b791-6" data-blocks='[["BL_791.5",791,[202,670,1247,859]]]'>¶3 M.H.R is the son of Leslie Bramlett and Paul Parvin. He was less than two years old when these dependency proceedings commenced. M.H.P’s parents experienced repeated episodes of mental illness, substance abuse, and incarceration in the years preceding and following M.H.P’s birth. The dependency proceedings commenced after Bram-lett, accompanied by M.H.P, arrived at an emergency room (ER) showing signs of paranoia and threatening the ER staff. M.H.P was removed from his parents’ care; he remained in the custody of the State until a guardianship order was entered more than two years later.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Two months after M.H.P was removed from his parents’ custody, the King County Superior Court found M.H.P dependent through agreed orders with both parents. Later the same month, the Department commenced proceedings to terminate Bramlett’s and Parvin’s parental rights.</p>

More than a month after that deadline passed and approximately six weeks before the original trial date, Bramlett filed an ex parte motion seeking public funds to retain expert services and a declaration from Bramlett’s attorney supporting the motion. The motion was accompanied by an order granting the motion for public funding signed by the head of the King County Office of Public Defense (now the King County Department of Public Defense). Also accompanying the motion and order were an <a id="p750" href="#p750" data-label="750" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*750</a>ex parte motion to seal and an ex parte motion for a protective order; a King County Superior Court judge signed orders granting both of those motions. M.H.P.’s parents filed two more such motions for expert services with accompanying motions to seal during the following two months. As before, the head of the King County Office of Public Defense signed orders granting the request for public funds and the judge signed orders sealing the motions, orders, and attached documents. The court granted and entered at least one more set of similar motions and orders after the trial court issued its opinion upholding this ex parte practice.</p>
    <p id="b792-4" data-blocks='[["BL_792.4",792,[202,958,1246,475]]]'>¶5 The declarations and other materials attached to the motions for expert funding included background information regarding the prospective experts and also some information regarding the types of evaluations and services the experts would perform. Two of the motions called for an expert to perform a “parenting” or “parent-child” observation. The court never disclosed the existence, much less the content, of these motions or orders to the CASA, the State, or the public.</p>
    <p id="b792-5" data-blocks='[["BL_792.5",792,[202,1457,1247,530]]]'>¶6 The CASA’s counsel inadvertently discovered the orders when reviewing the legal file while preparing for trial. She discovered similar ex parte motions and orders in the files of several other parental termination cases. After discovering the sealed documents, the Department filed a motion to show cause as to why the sealing orders should not be vacated and the ex parte documents unsealed in each of the 11 cases in which the ex parte motions and orders had been discovered. The CASA filed a response supporting the Department’s motion.</p>

The opinion did not discuss the <em>Ishikawa </em>factors, which we have held courts must use before granting a motion to seal. Instead, the superior court justified this procedure by asserting that the ex parte procedure was <a id="p751" href="#p751" data-label="751" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*751</a>necessary to protect the work product of indigent parents’ attorneys. The trial court analogized parental termination cases to criminal cases, in which CrR 3.1(f) permits defendants to file ex parte motions for expert services. The court asserted that parents in termination cases have an “identical” need to protect their work product as do criminal defendants. After the judge denied the Department’s motion for clarification, the petitioners appealed. The Department also filed notices of appeal in several other cases that were the subject of the trial court’s opinion and order; according to the Department, those appeals have been stayed pending our decision in this case.</p>
    <p id="b793-4" data-blocks='[["BL_793.4",793,[201,1022,1248,641]]]'>¶8 The trial date was continued several times at the request of one or both of the parents. After one such continuance, an agreed order withdrew the termination petition in favor of a guardianship petition. Less than two weeks before the trial date and more than eight months after the discovery deadline, Bramlett filed an amended witness list that included two previously undisclosed witnesses. One of those two witnesses—Dr. Carmela Washington-Harvey—had been the subject of two of the disputed ex parte sealing motions. The Department and the CASA moved to exclude those witnesses and the trial court granted that motion.</p>

The trial court’s ex parte sealing of the disputed documents violated all three of these requirements. The sealing of the disputed documents also ran afoul of article I, section 10 because the trial court failed to apply the <em>Ishikawa </em>factors, which require a court considering a motion to seal to provide an opportunity to object, use the least restrictive means, consider competing interests, and adequately limit the breadth of the sealing order.

The rule explicitly exempts motions filed under CrR 3.1(f) from the usual notice requirements; it does not include any such exemption for any motions filed in civil or juvenile court cases. “Under expressio unius est exclusio alterius, a canon of statutory construction, to express one thing in a statute implies the exclusion of the other.

Applying the <em>Mathews </em>factors, we conclude that due process does not require discarding GR 15 when parents seek such funding. While the interests at stake are significant for parents in termination proceedings, GR 15 does not infringe those interests, and compelling interests support the enforcement of GR 15.

While compliance with GR 15 discloses that an indigent parent is seeking funds to retain an expert, it would not meaningfully affect that parents’ ability to defend against a termination claim because other court rules would, in any event, require disclosure of the reports of any experts who would appear during the trial itself while shielding work product. Under CR 26(b)(5)(A)(i), all parties must disclose upon request “each person whom the . . . party expects to call as an expert witness at trial” and the substance of their anticipated testimony.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Because such disclosure would be required regardless of whether a parent requires public funds to retain an expert, the notice required by GR 15 does not give the State the right to access any more information about indigent parents’ testifying experts than all parties may receive under the civil discovery rules.</p>

Thus, parents would have to provide the CASA with a report regarding any physical or mental examination conducted on the child by their experts and provide the report to the Department as well if the child is in the State’s custody. Second, adverse parties may obtain nontestifying expert reports “upon a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.” CR 26(b)(5)(B).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Outside these narrow exceptions, CR 26(b)(4) and (5) protect the work product of parents’ attorneys and materials pertaining to parents’ nontestifying experts; courts can redact documents containing such materials while leaving the remainder unsealed.

Indeed, this “chill<a id="p762" href="#p762" data-label="762" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*762</a>ing effect” argument could just as easily be applied to experts who <em>are </em>called at trial because disclosing the substance of such experts’ anticipated testimony provides the Department and the CASA with insight into how the parents intend to attack the Department’s case for termination.

The State has a compelling interest in protecting the welfare of children. <em>E.g., In re Custody of Shields, </em><a href="/wash-2d/157/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="157 Wash. 2d 126" data-case-ids="3004189" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/157/0126-01">157 Wn.2d 126</a>, 144, <a href="/citations/?q=136%20P.3d%20117" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="136 P.3d 117">136 P.3d 117</a> (2006). Indeed, “we have ruled that a child’s welfare is the court’s primary consideration.

It follows that the child has a strong interest in the speedy resolution of dependency and termination proceedings, <em>see </em>RCW 13.34.020, and the State has an interest in ensuring such a speedy resolution to ensure that children do not remain in legal limbo—with the mental and emotional strain that entails—for any longer than is necessary.</p>

If an expert added through a sealed motion is later added to the witness list, the CASA and the State might be forced to request a continuance so that the State or the CASA can retain and prepare experts of their own. That possibility is not merely hypothetical. According to the CASA’s superior court brief, in one of the other cases subject to the superior court’s memorandum opinion, the <a id="p763" href="#p763" data-label="763" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*763</a>parents disclosed an expert retained through an ex parte sealing order in a supplemental witness list submitted shortly before trial.

We explained in <em>Ishikawa </em>that where the criminal defendant’s right to a fair trial right is balanced against the right of open access, a proponent of closure need show only a “ ‘likelihood of jeopardy’ ” to the fair trial right. <em>Ishikawa, </em>97 Wn.2d at 37 <em>(quoting Federated Publ’ns, Inc. v.

I join the majority’s conclusion that the records at issue in this case were subject to the constitutional mandate that “[j]ustice in all cases be administered openly.” Wash. Const. art. I, § 10. Not all records concerning a litigant’s indigency, however, will fall into this category. When they do fall into this category, they cannot be sealed without an individualized inquiry pursuant to <em>Ishikawa. </em>At a properly conducted <em>Ishikawa </em>hearing, the trial court judge must decide whether the interests asserted by the proponent of closure outweigh the public’s constitutional right to know what is going on in our courts. The trial judge must answer those difficult questions on a case-by-case basis. This court should not be answering them in advance, for every case that might arise, or for every asserted interest in closure that might arise.</p>

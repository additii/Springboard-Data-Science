Certain electors of the county, made parties defendant, served at said election as election judges in the wards of the city of Springdale and in certain townships of the county, and, by virtue of their service as such judges of election, have in their possession one copy of the tally sheets and poll books for their respective voting precincts. That § 3833, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, which is a portion of the chapter on Elections, provides that one of the certificates, tally sheets and poll books shall be retained by the judges free for the inspection of all persons. That these petitioners, individually and through their attorneys, agents and representatives, have made demand for an inspection of the certificates, tally sheets and poll books in the various voting precincts thereinbefore named of the election judges in their respective precincts, and that such election judges have refused to allow an inspection of such records, in violation of the laws of the State of Arkansas, and with the corrupt intent and purpose of fraudulently defeating these plaintiffs in their civil rights.</p>
    <p id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[163,1356,1206,906]]]'>That the county election commissioners have certified their opponents as having been elected to the offices for which petitioners were candidates, and “these plaintiffs are preparing contests of said election, and, in order to comply with the laAV of the State of Arkansas in preparing their contests, it is necessary for them to inspect the certificates, tally sheets and poll books of the respective Amting precincts hereinbefore set forth.” That, in preparing their notice of contest of said election, petitioners are required to set forth in said notice the names of the persons who voted in said precincts Avhose right to vote they challenge, together Avith their objections to the qualifications of such voters, and, in order to do this, it is necessary that they examine the poll books in said voting precincts and obtain therefrom a list of the names of such persons voting in such precincts. That four hundred persons voted in said precincts whose right to vote they challenge.</p>

    <p id="b100-4" data-blocks='[["BL_100.5",100,[304,676,1202,598]]]'>Upon these allegations, petitioners prayed that the judges who still refused petitioners the right to examine the poll books and tally sheets in their possession “be notified of this proceeding, and be required to appear and show cause why they have refused to perform their official duty and obey the laws of the State of Arkansas in relation to the matter hereinbefore set. forth, and that upon such hearing a writ of mandamus be issued commanding and compelling the said defendants to perform their official duty and allow these plaintiffs, their agents, attorneys and representatives, to inspect said records, and make such copies as they may see fit.”</p>

This section further provides that, “after making such certificates, the judges, before they disperse, shall put under cover one of said tally sheets, certificates and poll books and seal the same, and direct it to the board of county election commissioners. ’ ’</p>

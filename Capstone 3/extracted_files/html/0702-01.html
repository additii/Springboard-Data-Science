Though it may seem counterintuitive to require a writing only for long-term leases of mobile home lots when other tenancies expressly require acknowledgement for leases over a year, MHLTA leases are fundamentally different from other tenancies. This difference is deliberate, due at least in part to the fact that “ ‘[t]he park resident is in the unique position of owning his home while renting the land on which it is placed.’ ” Office of Program Research, <em>supra, </em>at 1 (quoting Lyle F.

But Western Plaza ignores the differences between the two statutory schemes and simply urges us to apply the general statute of frauds to the MHLTA.

This result follows from RCW 59.20.090, which provides that every MHLTA lease is for one year unless otherwise specified and that every lease automatically renews unless a party exercises the right to terminate in terms consistent with the MHLTA. Under Washington law, any automatic lease renewal must be added to the term of the lease for determining compliance with the statute of frauds. <em>Danielsen, </em>24 Wn.2d at 85. Thus, unless otherwise agreed between the parties, a MHLTA lease is for one year and automatically renews, making the lease term longer than one year and triggering the acknowledgement requirement of RCW 59.04.010.

Additionally, even RCW 59.04.010 explicitly requires a writing for every lease; leases governed by that statute that last for over one year also require acknowledgement. The requirement of a writing always exists; Western Plaza’s reading would render RCW 59.20.060(1) superfluous.</p>

However, I depart from the majority in its disregard of the statute of frauds for the purpose of reaching a particular result in this case. Nothing in the MHLTA creates or implies an exemption from the statute of frauds, which applies to leases of real property. Because Norma Tison’s lease does not comply with the statute of frauds, its specific provisions are subject to modification upon the lease’s annual renewal and the rent cap in this case was not an enforceable provision that carried forward in perpetuity.

None relate to the formation of leases. This makes perfect sense because the rights, remedies, and obligations <em>arising from </em>a contract are not the same as requirements for <em>entering into </em>a contract. The MHLTA also recognizes that both landlords and tenants must comply with “other applicable statute [s], regulation [s], or ordinance [s] of the state, county, or municipality” that are not found in the MHLTA.

The plain language of this provision ensures a minimum of formality for all MHLTA leases, even if the tenant chooses to enter a month-to-month lease. <em>See </em>RCW 59.20.050(1). But the fact that RCW 59.20.060(1) creates a minimum of formality for even the shortest MHLTA leases does not establish an irreconcilable conflict with RCW 59.04.010’s one-year limit on enforcing the provisions of written, unacknowledged leases.</p>

This provision does irreconcilably conflict with the general rule that where rent is paid on a monthly basis, a lease of indefinite duration is presumed to be month to month. RCW 59.04-.020. But that rule is a presumption used when interpreting leases that <em>do not comply </em>with the statute of frauds. <em>Labor Hall, </em>24 Wn.2d at 94. The fact that MHLTA leases are subject to a different interpretative presumption has no bearing on whether they are subject to the statute of frauds in the first place.

The MHLTA thus contemplates a presumptive lease term of one year (which is clearly enforceable under RCW 59.04.010) and adds a <em>qualified statutory </em>(not <em>absolute </em>contractual) right to renewal. It does not transform every MHLTA lease into a year-to-year agreement whose specific provisions must be renewed in perpetuity.

      <p id="b767-8" data-blocks='[["BL_767.8",767,[200,2154,1249,223]]]'> If applying the statute of frauds would be inequitable based on the facts presented, the proper approach is to apply the doctrine of part performance. <em>See Berg v. Ting, </em><a href="/wash-2d/125/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="125 Wash. 2d 544" data-case-ids="437068" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/125/0544-01">125 Wn.2d 544</a>, 555-56, 559, <a href="/citations/?q=886%20P.2d%20564" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="886 P.2d 564">886 P.2d 564</a> (1995). Determining whether part performance applies would require a remand for additional fact-finding on whether any checks at the lower rent were accepted by Western Plaza LLC. <em>See </em>majority at 706 &amp; n.4.</p>

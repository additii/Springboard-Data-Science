The court further announced, however, that, finder the circumstances shown in the agreed stipulation of facts by counsel, the presumption of sanity would be raised, which would shift the burden, and that the burden was on the appellants to show at the time of the execution of the deed to Mondschein that Ward was of unsound mind.</p>

Ward’s father died on the 5th day of April, 1897, and that no other guardian was ever appointed for Ward; that J. G. Ward transacted his own business, and the property in controversy belonged to Ward’s father, and at his death it descended to his three children, J. C. Ward, Lila Ward Neal and Lula Ward. Lila conveyed her interest to Lula and J. O. Then Lula died, and Lila conveyed to J.

C. Ward was of sound mind at the time of the execution of the deed rested upon the parties claiming under the deed. The chancellor, in fact, held that the burden was upon the person claiming under the deed, but that, under the circumstances shown by the stipulation and agreement of the parties, the burden shifted. In other words, the chancellor simply ruled that, in his judgment, the <em>prima facie </em>case made by showing that Ward had been adjudged insane was overcome by the agreed statement of facts, and that, so far as putting on the proof was concerned, the plaintiff should proceed with the proof, and there was no error in this ruling of the court. In the first place, cases appealed from the chancery court to this court are tried here <em>de </em>novo, and, where the decision of the chancellor is on a question of fact, the case will be <a id="p867" href="#p867" data-label="867" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*867</a>affirmed if the finding of the chancellor is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. In a trial before a jury it is proper to instruct them as to the burden of proof, because they are the triers of the facts, and they are required to return a verdict in favor of the party who has the preponderance of the evidence in his favor. And they are required to return a verdict against the party on whom the burden of proof rests if the evidence is evenly balanced or preponderates in favor of the other party.</p>
    <p id="b885-5" data-blocks='[["BL_885.5",885,[173,917,1198,147]]]'>The statute provides that the party holding the affirmative of an issue must produce the evidence to prove it. Section 4113, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest.</p>
    <p id="b885-6" data-blocks='[["BL_885.6",885,[172,1086,1196,192]]]'>Section 4113 of Crawford <em>&amp; </em>Moses ’ Digest provides that the burden of proof in the whole action lies on the party who would be defeated if no evidence were given on either side.</p>
    <p id="b885-7" data-blocks='[["BL_885.7",885,[168,1301,1202,915]]]'>In this case the court held that, if no evidence was given on either side, the burden rested upon the party claiming under the deed to show that Ward was sane at the time it was made. But evidence had been introduced; the stipulation had been agreed to and filed as evidence in the case, and the court held that that was sufficient to overcome the <em>prima facie </em>case of insanity. However, the burden of proof in a chancery case, so far as the procedure is concerned, is resorted to for no purpose other than to determine who shall proceed with his proof. And, even if the chancellor should require the wrong party to proceed first, it would not affect the decree or the trial in this court, unless it manifestly resulted in prejudice to the other party. This is true because the cases are tried here <em>de novo, </em>and if the chancellor required the wrong party to proceed first and then found in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence, the decree would be affirmed anyway.</p>

This court has held that a contract made by an insane person is not void, but void- ' able. We think the proof conclusively shows that for a number of years after Ward had been adjudged insane he was sane, and for 25 years took no steps whatever to avoid his contract.</p>
    <p id="b886-5" data-blocks='[["BL_886.5",886,[316,693,1199,558]]]'>The two questions involved in this case are, first, was Ward sane or insane at the time he made the deed to Mondschein? If he was sane, of course that ends the controversy. If he were insane at that time, then the question would arise whether he recovered and lived a number of years here without taking any steps to rescind the contract. Some witnesses testify that Ward was insane. 'Some of these witnesses, however, the interested ones, so conducted themselves prior to, at the time of, and after the execution of the deed, as to contradict the testimony that he was insane at the time.</p>

    <p id="b886-7" data-blocks='[["BL_886.7",886,[316,1412,1205,853]]]'>“In one of the master productions of his luminous intellect, Lord Stowell referred to the testimony of a witness who, as he said, was totally unimpeached as to general character, and therefore, <em>a priori, </em>entitled to be fully credited, and then proceeded as follows: ‘However, it is a good safe rule, in weighing evidence of a fact, which you cannot. compare with any other evidence to the same fact, to compare it with the actual conduct of the persons who describe it. If their conduct is clearly such as, upon their own showing, it could not have been, taking the fact in the way they have represented it, it is a pretty fair inference that the fact did not so happen. If their action, at the very time that the fact happened, represents it one way, and their relation of it, at a great distance of time, represents it another way, there can be no doubt which is the authentic narrative, which is the naked truth of the matter.”</p>
    <p id="b886-8" data-blocks='[["BL_886.8",886,[320,2281,1195,96]],["BL_887.1",887,[180,400,1202,658]]]'>In another case the same great magistrate said: “I am not deaf- to the fair pretensions of human testimony, <a id="p869" href="#p869" data-label="869" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*869</a>but, at the same time, I cannot shut my senses against the ordinary course of human conduct. 'Conduct of a witness clearly inconsistent with his testimony and not satisfactorily explained is one of the most fatal species of impeachment; because the trier of. facts is thus justified in disbelieving the testimony without in any degree" reflecting upon the integrity of the witness, who, it may be presumed, is a victim of the proverbial fickleness.of memory — especially after considerable time has elapsed —or of various perturbing psychological influences which affect men of the highest probity as well as those of indifferent moral natures, and operate with peculiar force if the witness is interested or otherwise biased.”</p>

He was to be married, and did marry a girl about 17 years of age. This was quite a while after he had been adjudicated insane. His sister deeded him her interest in the property, which she certainly would not have done if she had believed him to be insane, and he and his wife lived together, raised a family, and, for more than 25 years after the execution of the deed sought to be set aside, treated him' as <a id="p870" href="#p870" data-label="870" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*870</a>if lie were sane. They were ¡bound to know that he executed a mortgage on it; that that mortgage became due, and he was unable to pay it, and that he sold it; and yet no suggestion was ever made by any of the interested parties at any time that the deed was void or that he was insane at the time he made it. If he was insane at the time he inherited the property, his sister is in the attitude of conveying her interest to him and putting it in his power to squander it.</p>

In fact, the purchasers lost money; sold it for less than they had actually been out on it. And, while the fact that Ward was adjudiéated insane and stayed about six months in the insane asylum raises a presumption or inference that his state of mind continued, yet this presumption does no.t prevail where the contrary is made manifest by the conduct of the party and all of his relatives and friends. An adjudication of insanity is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence, as held toy this court, and we think the facts in this case overcome this presumption, and show clearly that, at the time of the execution of the deed, Ward was mentally capable of executing it.</p>

If any inference of continued mental incapacity must toe deduced from the adjudication of the county court in 1866, and the appointment then of Gr. D.

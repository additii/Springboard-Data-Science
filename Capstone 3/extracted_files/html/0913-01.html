The undisputed testimony shows that appellant had for years been a customer and depositor of the bank where his notes and business papers were all kept, the bank looking after this business and making credits upon the notes of payments by the debtors; and also that the cashier, Mr. Har-tón, who afterwards became president of the bank, advised with him about the execution of papers, notes and mortgages securing the money loaned by him, that he prepared this particular mortgage for execution and it was taken out by appellant and the signatures procured at the distant town and returned by mail immediately thereafter to the bank. The president of the bank had prepared the mortgage, evidently knew that it had not been recorded, collected payments on the note secured thereby, and before the note became due the bank took a mortgage conveying the same property to it for further security on a pre-existing debt due it, knowing at the time <a id="p916" href="#p916" data-label="916" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*916</a>that the appellant’s mortgage tbereon had not been recorded.</p>

The defendant became the purchaser at the sale, and, upon his failure to pay the purchase money, the land was again ordered sold upon the same terms, and was sold for a smaller amount</p>
    <p id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[296,558,1204,1323]]]'>The issue raised by the appeal is whether or not the defendant is liable to the other tenants in common for the deficiency between his bid and that for which the land was resold. The land in question is situated in the State of Alabama, and the partition proceedings were had in a court of that State. Therefore the decisions of the Supreme Court of that State must govern. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em><a href="/ark/144/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="144 Ark. 556" data-case-ids="1588040" data-case-paths="/ark/144/0556-01">144 Ark. 556</a>, and <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em><a href="/ark/47/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="47 Ark. 254" data-case-ids="1888743" data-case-paths="/ark/47/0254-01">47 Ark. 254</a>. The Supreme Court of the State of Alabama has held that, when the 'successful bidder 'at a judicial sale fails to complete the purchase by complying with the terms thereof, the land may be resold at his risk; and that, if a less price be brought at the second sale, the first purchaser becomes liable to the person injured by his default for the difference between the amount paid at the first sale and the price brought at the second, together with the expenses of the second sale. The court said that, in every judicial sale, there is a condition implied by law, which does not depend on any expression of the condition in the order of sale, or in the terms announced at the time of sale, that, if the purchaser fails to comply with the terms of the purchase, if accepted by the court, the land may be resold at his risk, and he will pay the deficiency arising on the second sale, together with the expenses thereof. <em>Howison </em>v. <em>Oakley, </em><a href="/ala/118/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="118 Ala. 215" data-case-ids="5604981" data-case-paths="/ala/118/0215-01">118 Ala. 215</a>.</p>

    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[158,536,1204,612]]]'>It appears from the record that the sale at which Richardson became the successful bidder was reported to the court, and that the sale was set aside because Richardson had failed to comply with the terms of the sale by paying the purchase money. Under the authority of the case of <em>Howison </em>v. <em>Oakley, <a href="/ala/118/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="118 Ala. 215" data-case-ids="5604981" data-case-paths="/ala/118/0215-01">supra,</a> </em>we are of the opinion that, under this state of'the record, the bid of Richardson was accepted by the court, and that the sale was vacated solely on the ground of Ms failure to pay the purchase money.

By reason of this implied condition, the purchaser agrees that, if he fails to comply with the terms of the purchase, the land may be resold at his risk, and he will pay the deficiency arising on the second sale. <em>Hutton </em>v. <em>Williams, </em><a href="/ala/35/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="35 Ala. 503" data-case-ids="5502802" data-case-paths="/ala/35/0503-01">35 Ala. 503</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=76%20Am.%20Dec.%20297" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="76 Am.

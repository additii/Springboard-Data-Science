Had known George W. Transue about five years'. During the years of 1924 and 1925 witness was cashier of said bank, and, as such cashier, and on behalf of said bank, had some business with the defendant, Transue,- with reference to the lands described in plaintiff’s complaint. He testified that Transue asked them to look after the renting of said land, collecting of rents, pay the taxes, and look after it for him in general. Transite was absent from the lands and out of the county most of the time. Witness looked after the renting of the land, paid the taxes for him, and any work that needed to be looked after on the place, such as repairing the buildings and looking after the cutting of timber, was done by witness. The rents were applied -on Transue’s account and indebtedness that he owed the bank and to pay interest to the New England Securities Company. There was an agreement that these rents were to be applied on the account and previous debts. This agreement was part of the agreement, made at defendant’s request, that the bank should pay what is commonly called the drainage taxes, and all taxes which included the drainage taxes, and what was generally called State and county taxes. The receipts for the drainage taxes for the years 1924 and 1925 are correct, which the bank paid at the request of defendant, and each are made exhibits to deposition, and marked A and B. The bank paid the State and county taxes for the year 1924 in the sum of $21.38, and receipt is attached as exhibit to witness’ deposition. The bank has an assignment- of the lien of the Western Clay Drainage District. It is a lien made by the drainage board, and signed by D. Hopson, as president, for the drainage taxes for the years 1924 and 1925. The same are correct and are made exhibits D -and E to deposition. The amount for each was $215.</p>

Since prior to. April 28, 1926, and up to the present time, witness has been solvent financially. Witness wrote a letter on the 10th of April, 1924, to George Transue, at Hoxie, Arkansas, with reference to paying the general taxes, in which letter he acknowledged having received letter from Transue, and he inclosed three checks, amounting to $21.62, for which he was given credit, and the letter stated that they would be glad to look after his taxes and use what scrip they could on them. But witness did not have the letter. Transue also requested verbally that witness look after the payment of his taxes, as Transue would be gone most of the year, and wanted the bank to look after the farm in general the same as if it was its own. Copies of two letters are attached to the deposition. Witness could hot state whether the State and county taxes for the year were paid on April 10, 1925, or at a subsequent date. Defendant gave instructions each year to pay the taxes, and was especially desirous that the ditch taxes be paid each year on account of avoiding a 25 per cent, penalty thereon. The assignment by D. Hopson, president of the Western Clay Drainage District, of a lien of said drainage district in favor of the First National Bank, was delivered to the bank a- week or ten days ago.</p>

Transne. After making first rental contracts there was a tenant quit, and he had to get other men to take his place. On behalf of the bank, witness looked after collecting rents and the payment to the bank by renters, and getting the crops gathered. Defendant asked witness to see that the tenants were getting along properly, and that they turned in their rent to the bank, and to see that Lindsey did not let his taxes go delinquent, as there was a heavy penalty if the taxes were not paid when due, and witness did that, in accordance with his request and that of the bank. Witness does not know what the rents amounted to, as his business was to see that the tenants left it at the bank, and he kept no record of the amount of either year.</p>

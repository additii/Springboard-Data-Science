On each of the first two days of jury selection in this case, the trial judge, the attorneys, and petitioner Frederick David Russell held work sessions to review juror questionnaires and to separate the hardship juror requests from the others. These work sessions occurred in the jury room, rather than in the courtroom, and the trial court did not conduct a Bone-Club<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> analysis on the record before holding the work sessions.</p>
    <p id="b776-6" data-blocks='[["BL_776.10",776,[197,1364,1247,320]]]'>¶2 Russell contends that the work sessions violated the public trial right guaranteed by article I, sections 10 and 22 of our state constitution and that his convictions should therefore be reversed.

Russell sideswiped a green Geo that was traveling in the opposite direction, then crashed head-on into a Cadillac that was behind the green Geo. The crash instantly killed the Cadillac’s driver and two passengers and severely injured three other passengers, leaving them <a id="p723" href="#p723" data-label="723" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*723</a>with permanent disabilities.

He posted bail but did not return for a pretrial hearing in October 2001. Russell was eventually captured in Ireland in 2005. In 2006, he was extradited back to the United States. Due to extensive pretrial publicity throughout eastern Washington, the trial court granted Russell’s motion to change venue.

The jury was not present, <em>id., </em>and it is not apparent from the record whether any members of the media or the public were in the courtroom. The judge announced that he, the attorneys, and Russell had held an in-chambers conference, <em>id., </em>where they had agreed to have a work session “in the jury room going through those [questionnaires] and trying to week [sic] out those that will automatically be excused for hardship pur<a id="p724" href="#p724" data-label="724" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*724</a>poses,” <em>id. </em>at 1297.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The court clerk then brought two prospective jurors to the court’s attention — one who was disqualified, possibly due to illness (although it is not entirely clear from the record), and another who had brought her child with her — and the judge excused both jurors in open court without objection. <em>Id. </em>at 1301-02. It appears from the record that the prospective jurors were in another room (not the courtroom) and that the courtroom clerk was communicating with court staff who were in that prospective juror holding room. The attorneys then confirmed there were no other preliminary issues that needed to be addressed. <em>Id. </em>at 1303.</p>

Those jurors were not excused from juror service altogether — they remained “on call for other Cowlitz County cases.” <em>Id. </em>at 1309.

In one of them, the judge and counsel retired to the judge’s chambers to conduct certain voir dire proceedings— and we began by addressing whether that constituted a courtroom closure. We noted that the record showed that the door to the judge’s chambers was open, the judge purposely left it open, and the judge subjectively character<a id="p735" href="#p735" data-label="735" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*735</a>ized his decision to leave the door open as somehow creating another open courtroom in chambers: “The court stated multiple times throughout this discussion and at the in-chambers questioning of the juror that the individual questioning had to and did remain a public proceeding. During the in-chambers questioning, the judge stated for the record, ‘The inner and outer door to my chambers are open. The courtroom door is closed, but this must remain a public proceeding.’ ” <em><a href="/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%201022" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="334 P.3d 1022">Id.</a> </em>at 457-58 &amp; n.6.

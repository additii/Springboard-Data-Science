Most, but not all, adult drug courts hold closed meetings, usually called staffings, where the drug court judge, attorneys, and treatment professionals meet to discuss each drug court participant’s progress. Following staffings, the drug court judge holds review hearings in open court, recounts the issues discussed at the staffing, receives the participant’s input, and then makes a decision as to the appropriate next steps in each participant’s case. We must determine whether the open courts provision of article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> requires adult drug court staffings to be presumptively open.

Adult drug courts are a relatively new phenomenon, so we may consider analogous traditional procedures to the extent they help our analysis. <em>See Morgan, </em>180 Wn.2d at 326.

This analogy has some force to it — in both adult drug court staffings and motions briefing, the information provided brings focus to the issues presented, establishes which facts are and are not disputed, and prepares the <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>judge for a decision. This analogy points toward a presumption of openness. However, in traditional motions practice, the parties seek different results, while in properly functioning adult drug courts, everyone has the same goal — the participant’s successful completion of the program.

At such conferences, the attorneys and a trial court judge meet with the shared goals of simplifying the issues, determining what facts are disputed, and addressing any other issues “as may aid in the disposition of the action.” CR 16(a)(5). These conferences are not recorded, transcribed, or held in open court and are instead memorialized in the record by an order that recites what occurred and what agreements were reached.

In presumptively open staffings, all issues must be addressed in open court, including any arguments the team members might have regarding issues of genuine contention. At that point, the drug court team members start to look like individuals presenting opposing arguments to a neutral decision-maker — that is, advocates in ordinary adversarial proceedings.

The parties and case manager may present different positions on these matters. The judge is in charge of making a decision when consensus cannot be reached. The judge will frequently notify the parties of his or her preliminary thoughts on changes to the defendant’s treatment plan that will be ordered or sanctions the court is considering. The staffings form the basis for what is done at the review hearings and, ultimately, inform what happens in the event the case manager or the prosecutor requests a defendant be terminated from the drug court program. “During the team meetings [staffings], the DDC [(drug diversion court)] team strives to reach consensus on the next course of action for <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>each DDC participant.

As noted above, article I, section 10 provides that “[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly.” A defendant enters drug court as part of adjudicating a criminal <em>case </em>filed in a superior court of the state of Washington. The staffing is an integral part of drug court because it is where the greatest amount of information is shared between the parties and with the judge. The judge is intimately involved in this process, as the parties evaluate a participant’s successes and failures in the program. The judge’s rulings can reward success, correct missteps, or punish the participant’s failures. Under these circumstances, the judge’s involvement can fairly be characterized as the <em>administration </em>of justice in a <em>case </em>filed in a superior court. The judge’s role in staffing — to participate, evaluate, and make decisions as needed — is akin to the role played by the judge in <em>Chen </em>regarding the preliminary competency determination.

Instead, it waived her right “to a speedy and public <em>trial </em>by an impartial jury in the county where <em>the crime </em>is alleged to have been committed.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 18 (“Drug Diversion Court Waiver and Agreement”) (emphasis added).

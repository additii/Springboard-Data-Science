The cotton seed were of the same kind, and the evidence showed how many pounds of mortgaged seed and how many pounds of free seed were put into the seed house.</p>

At least, the court held that the evidence clearly preponderates in favor of the appel-lee in their contention that Williamson, who represented the mortgagee, was present on the streets when Perkins, the mortgagor, was selling cotton, and made no objections to the sale. The lower court also found that the mortgagee expressly agreed with the purchaser that he could buy from the mortgagor, and this court said that it could not say that the finding of the chancery court was against the preponderance of the evidence.</p>

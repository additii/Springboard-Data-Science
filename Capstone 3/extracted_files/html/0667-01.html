She spoke to Mr. Ford about the kind of butter, and he told her which was the best seller, and she put the bos of butter in the basket, not her shopping bag, and walked right out by Mr. Ford where the eggs were, put two dozen of them in her basket, and went to the meat counter, where she purchased some meat, and put this in the basket, not in her bag. She then went to the cashier’s desk where the things she purchased were checked, paid for the articles purchased, and received the change to which she was entitled.</p>

The man that ran up behind her was Mr. Ford, out of the Black &amp; White Store.</p>

Now, before a recovery can be had for slander, the words spoken must of themselves charge a crime; and, as the court sees, the words: ‘You have butter for which you have not paid,’ does not charge a crime of stealing.”</p>

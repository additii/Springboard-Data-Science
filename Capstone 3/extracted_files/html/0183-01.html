      <em>McCollum </em>v. <em>Cushing, </em><a href="/ark/22/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="22 Ark. 540" data-case-ids="8727242" data-case-paths="/ark/22/0540-01">22 Ark. 540</a>, is cited as authority for this position. Without going into a detailed discussion of the letter referred to in the McCollum case, we think, in effect, that there is a marked difference between it and the letter in the instant case. The letter in the McCollum case was merely an offer of guaranty and so demonstrates upon its face, whereas in the instant case there is an absolute guaranty of the contemplated obligation. Therefore we conclude that this case is not ruled by the McCollum case.</p>

Where the transaction is not merely an offer to guaranty the payment of debts, and amounts to a direct promise of guaranty, all that is necessary to make the promise binding is that the promisee should act upon it; he need not notify the promisor of his acceptance.”</blockquote>

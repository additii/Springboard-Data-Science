Witnesses measured the tracks and followed the tracks, tracking a wagon and mules up to where the appellant lived. They measured the tracks of mules when they got to appellant’s place and the measurements were the same; that the mules .they found in the lot there were shod in front, and there was evidence that they had been recently used, and that the sweat had not dried off the harness. They followed the tracks of the mules and wagon from the place where the cotton was taken to appellant’s place, and a number of witnesses testified that the tracks were the same, and that no other wagon had gone along there.</p>

The principle invoked is not applicable to the facts alleged and admitted to be true by the demurrer. Our construction of the allegation is that Duncan signed and delivered the note to appellee as a binding obligation, with the understanding that he should be released whenever C. E. Ellison signed the note. In other words, that he should be bound upon the note until the signature of C. E. Ellison was obtained. Proof responsive to this allegation would have contradicted the writing, and for that reason could not have been, introduced. It was proper therefore to sustain the demurrer to the answer. Had the agreement for the <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>substitution of Ellison as a debtor in the place of Duncan been subsequent to the first agreement, or bad the agreement been for the note not to become a binding obligation" until signed by Ellison, either allegation would have been impervious to attack by demurrer, for proof of the allegations would have in no wise contradicted the written instrument.</p>

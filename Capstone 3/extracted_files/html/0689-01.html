The court entered dispositional orders placing the children in out of home care and requiring T.P. to engage in services including parenting evaluation, mental health counseling, services through the Sexual Assault Response Center, substance abuse assessment, and random urine analysis (UA). A.W.’s and M.W.’s dependencies were reviewed at the required six month intervals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The court ordered services were similar to those required as part of dependency and included a parenting evaluation, mental health counseling, Family Preservation Services (FPS), submitting to random UAs, and obtaining and maintaining a safe place to live. A safety plan outlines the conditions for the children to be returned home and is created once a parent engages in FPS. Dr. Michelle Leifheit provided FPS to T.P., and T.P. agreed to the safety plan developed by Dr. Leifheit and DSHS. A term in the safety plan prohibited T.P. from allowing her significant other, S.B., to have unsupervised access to the children because S.B. did not pass DSHS’ background check.</p>

Nonetheless, T.P. asserted that she was improving and the children could be returned to her care in the near future. T.

This chapter created a new process to establish, modify, and terminate guardianships for dependent children in foster care. H.B. Rep. on Substitute H.B. 2680, 61st Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2010) (hereinafter H.B. Rep.). The legislature enacted the new statute to “create a separate guardianship chapter to establish permanency for children in foster care through the appointment of a guardian and dismissal of the dependency.” RCW 13.36.010.</p>

When DSHS continues dependency, it provides services to the parent in an attempt to reunify the parent and the child. <em>See </em>RCW 13.34.020-.025. A dependency is reviewed every six months to determine if agency involvement is still necessary. RCW 13.34.138. Dependency guardianships established under the old statute were used as a permanency option for children who were in foster care and for whom reunification with parents or adoption was not promising. H.B. Rep. at 1.

    <p id="b734-4" data-blocks='[["BL_734.5",734,[187,560,1249,727]]]'>¶15 While dependency guardianships were considered a permanency option and the dependency guardian had many of the same rights and responsibilities as the parent, the underlying dependency was not dismissed. <em>Id. </em>As such, the court could order continued involvement by DSHS. RCW 13.34.235.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In addition, when a dependency guardianship was established, parents maintained several rights. <em>See </em>former RCW 13.34.232 (1994). In contrast, termination completely severs the parent and child relationship, as well as DSHS’ services and involvement for the parent.

Lord Campbell’s Act gave certain family members a cause of action for a relative’s wrongful death, but only if that <a id="p719" href="#p719" data-label="719" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*719</a>relative would have had a cause of action for the injury at the time of death had death not occurred. While our state’s legislature did not adopt that limitation, almost a century ago, this court did. We have since carved out some exceptions. We are asked today to abandon that limitation completely and to reinstate a daughter’s case for the wrongful death of her father even though the father did not have a cause of action against the defendants at the time of his death.</p>

The majority does not doubt that Deggs’s statutory action was timely filed, but it holds that any claim was barred because the statute of limitations ran on her father’s personal injury claims before he died. I respectfully dissent. The majority’s holding is contrary to Washington’s wrongful death statute, which was enacted to allow a freestanding cause of action for family members that cannot arise before the death of their loved one. The majority’s sole justification for undermining the statute is reliance on precedent—more specifically, on the holding of a single case we subsequently recognized was wrong and have never extended. The majority agrees this precedent is incorrect, but sees no harm in perpetuating its topsy-turvy illogic. I do. I would overrule <em>Calhoun v.

I fail to see why this matters. Whatever the state of the law might be in other jurisdictions, there is no split of authority in Washington on the question of accrual. Our cases from <em>Dodson </em>through <em>Atchison </em>make clear that the statutory action under RCW 4.20.010 accrues at the time of death, subject to tolling.</p>
      <p id="b773-6" data-blocks='[["BL_773.6",773,[201,1596,1248,781]]]'>As for whether a prior recovery in a personal injury action may bar the claim, that is not an issue before us, contrary to the majority’s suggestions. <em>See id. </em>(characterizing bar due to prior recovery as one of the “critical issues before us’’); <em>see also id. </em>at 728-29 (purporting to leave open the possibility of overruling <em>Calhoun </em>in a different case, but not here, “where the deceased knew of the injury, sued, and either settled with or won against all the named defendants’’). While the specter of “double recovery’’ floats about this case, nothing in the record shows that Sundberg recovered judgment against any of the defendants to this action or executed a contractual release in their favor. Nor have the defendants raised arguments based on issue or claim preclusion in this court. Moreover, whether this wrongful death action is barred under legal, contractual, or equitable principles based on Sundberg’s prior recovery presents an entirely different question from whether it is barred by the rule in <em>Calhoun. </em>Finally, where the possibility of double recovery exists between a claim personal to the decedent and a wrongful death claim, we have addressed it by tailoring damages, not by barring a timely wrongful death claim. <em>See Criscuola v. Andrews, </em><a href="/wash-2d/82/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="198" data-cite="82 Wash. 2d 68" data-case-ids="1130138" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/82/0068-01">82 Wn.2d 68</a>, 70-71, <a href="/citations/?q=507%20P.2d%20149" class="citation" data-index="199" data-cite="507 P.2d 149">507 P.2d 149</a> (1973) (refusing to disallow overlapping survival and wrongful death actions, and instead avoiding double recovery by limiting lost income in survival action to net accumulations); WPI 31.01 cmt. at 336 (recognizing that same recovery may be allowed under survival and wrongful death statutes and “[c]are must be taken to avoid allowing a double recovery’’).</p>

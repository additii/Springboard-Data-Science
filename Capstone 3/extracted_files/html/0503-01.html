The complaint alleges that the plaintiff: is the mother, guardian and next friend of John Henry Donnahoe, her minor child. That she was divorced from her husband, the father of the infant, under a decree of the Crittenden Chancery Court rendered at the January, 1919, term thereof, and that, by the terms of this decree, she was awarded the custody of the child.</p>

Her son and another boy of about the same age were climbing up a tree to get a bird’s nest, and there came in contact with a live wire, from which contact her son sustained serious injuries; that her divorced husband took out letters of guardianship in Cross County, where he resided, without notice to her or to the infant. The defendant, Union Indemnity Company, became surety upon the guardian’s bond, and was sued in that capacity.</p>

The court further finds for the plaintiff, Jim Donnahoe, in the sum of $1,i800 in his own right, and the plaintiff, Jim Donna-hoe, as guardian of John Donnahoe, a minor, in the sum of $1,700.</p>

Mr. Donnahoe had removed to Arizona on account of the ill health of his present wife, and was made party to this proceeding by the publication of a warning order.</p>

The boy’s mother, the plaintiff in the instant case, made application for letters of guardianship in succession in the Cross County Probate Court, and, when that application was refused, she applied for and obtained letters of guardianship in the Crittenden County Probate Court.</p>

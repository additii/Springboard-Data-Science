Beekman became indebted to the Bank of DeQueen, of DeQueen, Arkansas, in the sum of $5,000, and, to secure its payment, executed a mortgage to that bank covering blocks 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the Garrison Addition to the city of DeQueen. The mortgage secured the debt then due, which was evidenced by a note payable six months after date, and also any renewals thereof. The note was not paid, and was renewed from time to time, the last renewal being oh March 22, 1929, the note then executed in renewal being payable six months after date.</p>

The bank became insolvent, and was taken over by the State Bank Commissioner for liquidation, and suit was filed in his name on February 17, 1933, for judgment on the note and to foreclose the mortgage securing it, and, at the same time, a <em>lis pendens </em>notice was filed conforming to chapter 112, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, on that subject. This notice gave the date of the original note, and recited its renewal, the last being the note sued on. The execution of the mortgage securing the note was alleged, and the book and page of its record was stated.</p>

The intervener prayed that the mortgage sought to be foreclosed be declared barred by the five years’ statute of limitations as to him, for the reason that there had been no indorsement of payment, or other renewal, on the margin of the record as required by § 7382, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest.</p>

Two of these had been damaged by a storm, and the Commissioner caused them to be repaired. The third house was rented to a tenant, and the Commissioner collected the rents thereon. The intervener lived in an adjoining house, and made no denial of this possession.</p>

There was no express repeal of the earlier act by the later one, nor was the earlier act repealed by necessary implication. Both acts may stand and each accomplish the purpose of its enactment. The <em>lis pendens </em>notice-does not operate to revive a lien which the statute of limitations has extinguished. The mortgage lien was in full force and effect as between the parties, and, suit having been brought to foreclose it, the <em>lis pendens </em>notice gave warning of that fact. The mortgage record was no longer the sole evidence of the lien of the mortgage of which a prospective purchaser from the mortgagor was required to take notice. All persons know that the lien may be kept in force between the parties thereto, although § 7382, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, had not been complied with, and, if the statutory notice has been given, as was done in the instant case, that a suit was pending to foreclose the lien, one deals with the subject-matter of the litigation at his peril, and, if he purchased the mortgaged property under the circumstances stated, he takes title subject to the rights of the parties litigant.</p>

It is first sought to uphold the order of the chancellor directing* a resale of the property because of act 21 of 1933. This act in effect authorizes the respective chancery courts of the State to refuse to confirm commissioner’s sales, irrespective of fraud or inequitable conduct in effecting the sale.</p>

Before confirming a sale, the court shall ascertain whether or not, on account of economic conditions, or the circumstances attending the sale, a fair price with reference to the in<a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>trinsic value of the property was obtained. If it is made to appear to the court that a better price could be obtained at a resale, or if any one agrees to bid a substantially higher amount at a resale, the court shall order a resale on such terms as the court may require.” This act was approved February 9, 1933.</p>

Therefore, the provisions of act 21 of 1933 cannot be given a retroactive effect so as to impair appellant’s vested interest in the property.</p>

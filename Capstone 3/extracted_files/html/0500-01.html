We accepted review to address whether the West Sound Narcotics Enforcement Team (WestNET), a multijurisdictional drug task force, is an entity subject to the PRA. Because the trial court granted the defendant’s CR 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, we reach only a narrower procedural issue: Can the parties to an interlocal agreement establish, as a matter of law, that their own task forces do not exist for the purpose of the PRA?</p>

That approach is inconsistent with our general approach to PRA issues and the ICA itself. RCW 39.34.030(5).

The sheriff’s office did not indicate why it responded instead of WestNET — neither explaining that WestNET did not exist as a legal entity or that WestNET was otherwise exempt from the PRA requirements.

We hold that the trial court’s reliance on the pleadings and the Agreement alone is inconsistent with that approach. The court cannot rely solely on the self-imposed terms of an interlocal agreement because the document does not reveal whether the task force, in fact, behaves consistently with that nonentity designation. For example, it is conceivable that despite its own terms, WestNET operates independently, maintains its own records, and effectively exists as a separate government agency such that it should be subject to the broad scope of the PRA and its provisions. The trial court could have considered other relevant factors that were not apparent from the terms in the Agreement: Does WestNET <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>maintain a separate physical office? Where are the task force records kept? Does WestNET have a designated custodian of the records? If WestNET is not subject to the PRA, how would interested individuals request documents and to what extent would an individual have to engage in a document search among the 10 different municipalities and agencies? Essentially, the inquiry should focus on whether an interested individual could still adequately exercise his or her rights under the PRA if record requests and suits cannot be brought against WestNET directly.

It is also conceivable that the affiliate agencies could use this arrangement to strategically move documents among the multiple agencies or that WestNET could even keep documents with those affiliate agencies that are not subject to the PRA, such as the NCIS, in which case the affiliate agencies could avoid their PRA obligations entirely.

The question before us, contrary to the majority’s assertion, is not whether public records related to West Sound Narcotics Enforcement Team (WestNET) are immune from disclosure. Clearly they are not, since Worthington admits that Kitsap County and other agencies have made West-NET records available to him. Rather, the question is only the proper party against whom a dispute about those records can be brought in court. Here, Worthington requested and received records from Kitsap County but challenged Kitsap County’s responses by suing WestNET, which is not a legal entity. Because WestNET lacks the capacity to be <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>sued, I would affirm the Court of Appeals.

A more thorough review of Worthington’s complaint and attached exhibits is useful. Between 2010 and 2011, Worthington submitted four requests for public records related to the operation of “WestNET,” the shorthand term for a group of 10 agencies jointly investigating drug crimes. He sent each of these requests by e-mail to employees of Kitsap County — only one of WestNET’s 10 members — who responded by letter to each request and provided Worthington at least some responsive records. For example, Kitsap County replied to one request by “present-ting] a stack of papers” for Worthington’s review. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 2. In response to another, the county “indicated [it] [w]ould release 539 pages of documents,” which constituted its “entire investigative file.” CP at 4, 35.

The merits of that claim are not before us because instead of suing Kitsap County, Worthington named “WestNET” as the defendant. This is why I depart from the majority opinion. This case is not about whether “parties to an interlocal agreement [can] establish . .. that their own task forces do not exist for the purpose of the PRA,” majority at 503, or whether an interlocal agreement can “provide for task force immunity” from records requests. <em>Id. </em>at 509.

Tegland, Washington Practice: Civil Procedure § 11:7, at 386 (2d ed. 2009). Thus the dispositive question is whether WestNET is an entity capable of suit. Entities are creatures of statute, and those statutes control the scope of the entities’ existence. Counties, municipal corporations, and state agencies, for example, each have the capacity to be sued because they spring from enabling statutes that expressly create separate legal entities. <em>See </em>RCW 36.01.010 (counties); RCW 35.58.180 (municipal corporations).</p>

The terms of the inter-local agreement dictate whether the cooperative is merely an aggregation of its component entities or whether it creates a new entity in itself. RCW 39.34.030(3)-(4). And the terms of the agreement creating WestNET and the majority are equally clear that the agreement “ ‘do[es] not intend to create ... a separate legal entity.’ ” Majority at 504 (quoting <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>Resp’t’s Suppl. CP at 127). As a result, I would apply <em>Roth </em>and hold WestNET is not a separate legal entity and lacks the capacity to be sued, and find that WestNET’s component entities are the only viable defendants in this case. Those component entities are the “agencies” subject to the PRA that allow the public to obtain records related to WestNET’s operation. RCW 42.56.010, .070.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[201,743,1254,1363]]]'>¶29 The majority rejects this result for two reasons, both unrelated to capacity. First, it holds that a subsection in the ICA — RCW 39.34.030(5) — requires we look to facts beyond the agreement’s terms to determine if WestNET is an entity with obligations under the PRA. But subsection (5) speaks only to the obligations of WestNET’s <em>members, </em>not of WestNET <em>itself. </em>The subsection provides that interlocal agreements cannot “relieve [ ] any public agency of any obligation or responsibility” otherwise required by law. RCW 39.34.030(5); <em>see also </em>RCW 39.34.030(2) (distinguishing a “public agencfy],” like WestNET’s component members, from its cooperative undertakings, like WestNET). The plain language of subsection (5) merely reaffirms that counties and municipalities cooperating under the ICA have existing legal obligations; it does not impose any obligations on the interlocal cooperatives those entities join. Simply put, Kitsap County cannot contract away its responsibilities under the PRA, but neither is WestNET required to assume them,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">11</a> and the agreement here is unequivocal that “[a]ll rights, duties and obligations of the [contributing agency] shall remain with the contributing agency.” Resp’t’s Suppl. CP at 128. Worthington’s action likewise remains only against WestNET’s component members, and each member remains obligated to comply with the PRA for records it holds related to WestNET operations.</p>

      <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>¶30 Second, the majority suggests that the overriding purpose of the PRA trumps the fundamental issue of whether WestNET has the capacity to be sued. While I wholeheartedly agree with the PRA’s purpose, I cannot endorse the majority’s result-oriented capacity analysis. “Questions relating to capacity are resolved by looking to the characteristics of the <em>party, </em>rather than the circumstances of a particular <em>claim.” </em>Tegland, <em>supra, </em>§ 11:7, at 386 (emphasis added). In other words, a party’s capacity to be sued should not depend on the statutory claim the plaintiff asserts. Because the majority overlooks this principle and instead focuses on vindicating the PRA, its opinion creates the odd result where WestNET is an “entity” that can be sued under the PRA but not under other statutes. For example, Worthington could not sue WestNET in federal court for alleged constitutional violations under <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 1983">42 U.S.C. § 1983</a>. There, as should be the case here, he would need to bring an action against WestNET’s component entities. <em>See Hervey v. Estes, </em><a href="/f3d/65/0784-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="65 F.3d 784" data-case-ids="7413143" data-case-paths="/f3d/65/0784-01">65 F.3d 784</a>, 791-92 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding “TNET,” a Tacoma-area drug task force also organized under the ICA, is not a person subject to suit since its interlocal agreement “d[id] not contemplate a separate legal entity”).</p>

As the majority opinion acknowledges, the ICA contemplates that some interlocal agreements will not create an entity with powers separate from those of its individual components. That possibility creates some administrative problems. The ICA seeks to address those problems by requiring two additional provisions in interlocal agreements that do not create separate legal entities: (1) the agreement must identify an administrator or a joint board responsible for the interlocal cooperative and (2) it must specify how the cooperative acquires, holds, and disposes of property. RCW 39.34.030(4). Noticeably absent from this list of additional required provisions is one identifying a records custodian charged with responding to PRA re<a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>quests. Such omission results in many of the policy concerns the majority cites to support its conclusion that WestNET is a stand-alone entity. <em>See </em>majority at 511 (noting that “without any designated keeper of WestNET records, the coordination of documents among the 10 contributing municipalities could potentially render disclosure requests ... impractical or cumbersome”).</p>
    <p id="b554-4" data-blocks='[["BL_554.5",554,[201,733,1251,795]]]'>¶32 It might be good policy to require interlocal agreements to designate a records custodian who can coordinate records requests among the cooperative’s component agencies. Doing so would relieve requestors from sending multiple requests, would ensure all agencies with responsive records receive the request, and would discourage perfunctory denials of requests. But the plain language of the ICA does not require interlocal agreements to address public records requests. It is not this court’s job to insert words into statutes or create judicial fixes, even if we think the legislature would ultimately approve of the result. Statutes that frustrate the purpose of others, though perhaps unintentional, are “purely a legislative problem.” <em>State ex rel. Hagan v. Chinook Hotel, Inc., </em><a href="/wash-2d/65/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="65 Wash. 2d 573" data-case-ids="1966249" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/65/0573-01">65 Wn.2d 573</a>, 578, <a href="/citations/?q=399%20P.2d%208" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="399 P.2d 8">399 P.2d 8</a> (1965).</p>

I would affirm the Court of Appeals because WestNET is not a separate legal entity and has no capacity to be sued, and capacity is a legal question that a trial court can resolve on a CR 12(b)(6) motion. The Court of Appeals properly affirmed the trial court’s dismissal.</p>

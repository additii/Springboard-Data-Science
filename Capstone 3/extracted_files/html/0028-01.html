The U.W. introduced this policy to address concerns that they were focusing on acquiring faculty “stars” at the expense of retaining high-performing existing faculty. The U.W. president outlined the new policy in Executive Order (EO) 64, which was later incorporated into the university faculty handbook. Specifically, EO 64 provided:</p>
    <blockquote id="b73-6" data-blocks='[["BL_73.6",73,[147,1737,1208,342]]]'>All faculty shall be evaluated annually for merit and for progress towards reappointment, promotion and/or tenure, as appropriate.

First, the university suspended the policy for the 2002-2003 academic year, which formed the basis for the litigation in <em>Storti v. University of Washington, </em>No. 04-2-16973-9 (King County Super. Ct., Wash. 2004) <em>(Storti </em>I). In that instance, the U.W. did not follow the applicable procedure but instead simply excluded the raises from its 2002-2003 budget when the legislature did not appropriate funds for the university to pay salary increases. Following the <em>Storti </em>I litigation, the university reinstated the salary policy until 2009, when it was again suspended. This second suspension forms the basis for the current <em>Storti v.

In contrast to the first suspension, this second suspension followed complex procedures. Faced with a deep recession and major budget cuts, the university president and the faculty senate chair appointed faculty and administrative personnel to a “Committee to Re-Evaluate Executive Order No. 64.” CP at 1226. This committee, in turn, proposed and submitted to the faculty for review an EO suspending the merit raise. The faculty reviewed this proposed order and consulted with the university president about their proposed revisions. Then, on March 31, 2009, the university president issued EO 29, an order suspending the merit raise instituted in EO 64 <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>until the conclusion of the 2009-2011 biennium.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Because several arguments stem from the related litigation that preceded <em>Storti </em>II, it is important to review the history.</p>

In <em>Storti </em>I, Professor Storti challenged the U.W.’s first suspension of the merit raise policy for the 2002-2003 academic year, alleging breach of contract. The class was defined as “[a]ll University of Washington faculty who worked in the 2001-02 academic year and the 2002-03 academic year, and who were not found unmeritorious for their service in the 2001-02 academic year.” CP at 491. The superior court entered summary judgment for Storti based on the plain language of the faculty salary policy. The court did not consider whether the U.W. followed the proper process for “reevaluation” of the policy because the university simply withheld funds from the university budget. After summary judgment was granted, the parties entered into a settlement under which the U.W. reinstated its annual merit raise policy and agreed to pay $17.45 million in back pay, interest, and attorney fees to the faculty class.</p>

Nye filed suit in October 2009 and never sought class certification. Professor Nye argued that the university’s <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>suspension breached a bilateral contract and that even if the U.W. did have the power to suspend the policy, it did not follow the proper procedure to do so. The superior court denied Nye’s motion for summary judgment and entered summary judgment for the university. Nye appealed, but the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, reasoning that the express terms of the handbook policy allowed for modification of the merit raise provision and specified that executive orders are effective immediately when entered. <em>Nye, </em><a href="/wash-app/163/0875-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="163 Wash.

According to Storti, the university has the power to suspend the policy but cannot. do so retroactively by retracting its promise after faculty had substantially performed. This retroactive retraction, Storti argues, constitutes a breach of a unilateral contract between the university and the faculty. A proper “reevaluation” would have suspended the policy effective for the 2010-2011 academic year, 15 months after passage of EO 29. Here the class is defined as “[a] 11 University of Washington faculty who served in the 2008-09 academic year and the 2009-10 year, and who were not found unmeritorious for their service in the 2008-09 academic year.” CP at 1485.

The superior court granted the U.W.’s motion for summary judgment on June 24, 2011. Storti then moved for direct appeal in this court, but we transferred the appeal to the Court of Appeals. Division One affirmed in an unpublished opinion. <em>Storti </em>II, <a href="/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206554827" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2012 WL 6554827">2012 WL 6554827</a>, at *4-7, 2012 Wash. App. LEXIS 2898, at *18-21. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the suspension did not breach any contract because EO 29 was effective when signed, the funding cautions provision notified faculty that the policy could be modified, and contracts are <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>defined by specific language contained therein. The court also cited its earlier published decision in <em>Nye </em>as support for its holding. Finally, the court explained that res judicata did not apply because neither the evidence presented nor the facts relied on in <em>Storti </em>II were identical to those in <em>Storti </em>I.

Although the term “reevaluate” indicates a procedural requirement, it does not connote the 15-month waiting period that petitioners advocate. <em>See Hearst, </em>154 Wn.2d at 503. Moreover, the contract terms must be interpreted in light of the entire faculty handbook. Here, the university faculty handbook establishes a specific procedure for implementing executive orders and provides that these orders are effective when enacted. In particular, section 12-21(B) of the handbook outlines the president’s power to issue executive orders, provides that a proposed order must be sent to the faculty senate for review, and mandates that the president consult with the faculty senate chair regarding proposed revisions.

Unlike in <em>Storti </em>I, here the university followed proper procedures to effect a reevaluation. There is no requirement that the university’s policy change be delayed until the subsequent academic year.

The University contends that the Funding Cautions provision rendered the merit pay promise contingent on legislative appropriations. But EO 64, which is primarily a statement of salary-related priorities, explicitly distinguishes between salary increases that are mandatory, those that are discretionary, and those that are contingent on legislative appropriations. It makes <em>mandatory </em>the two percent raise following a year of meritorious performance while making other “allocations” — e.g., for promotions in rank and “to address differentials occurring in the academic labor markets” — merely discretionary. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 338 (EO 64, at 3). Most importantly, it provides that other “higher levels of salary increases [shall be awarded] <em>as permitted by available funding.” </em>CP at 337 (EO 64, at 2) (emphasis added). Had the University intended to make the two percent merit raises contingent on legislative appropriations, it could easily have done so explicitly, as it did with respect to the “[bjigher level[ ]” increases. <em><a href="/citations/?q=115%20P.3d%20262" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="115 P.3d 262">Id.</a> </em>The fact that the University specifically designated some raises as contingent on legislative appropriations indicates that it did <em>not </em>intend to make others similarly contingent. <em>See Burton v.

It then stated that <em>“[&lt;Additional </em>levels of increase are dependent upon funding.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=399%20P.2d%2068" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="399 P.2d 68">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis added). By contrast, the University points to nothing in the record, other than the disputed Funding Cautions provision itself, which put faculty members on notice that their meritorious performance did not actually entitle them to a raise.</p>

With respect to the merit raise, it did not do so. Instead, it promised faculty members that meritorious performance would be rewarded with a raise in the following year. The plaintiffs in this case rendered meritorious service in reliance on that promise. They substantially performed their obligations under the merit pay <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>contract, and they are entitled to enforce it.

This is puzzling. There are only two possible interpretations of the ambiguous “funding cautions” provision at issue in this case. EO 64. According to the faculty, the Funding Cautions provision means that the merit raises are not guaranteed <em>forever. </em>According to the University and the majority, the provision means that the merit raises are <em>never </em>guaranteed — that they can be rescinded even <em>after </em>faculty members have earned them through substantial performance.</p>
      <p id="b85-8" data-blocks='[["BL_85.8",85,[100,2131,1250,258]]]'>The University offers only one argument to support its (fairly extreme) interpretation: the argument that the Funding Cautions provision was intended to allow the University to respond <em>immediately </em>to shortfalls in legislative funding. According to the University, the faculty members knew that the merit raise contemplated this immediate response and therefore also knew that the merit raises were never truly guaranteed. If the majority does not credit this argument, it has no basis for rejecting the faculty’s interpretation of EO 64.</p>

The railroad company received information on April 8,1920, that there was an embargo placed by the railroads running into Kansas City on all kinds of freight consigned to that place. The embargo on freight for Kansas City was due to a switchmen’s strike, and the agents on the Arkansas Central Eailroad Company were notified that no freight would be received consigned to Kansas City, Missouri, until the embargo was lifted. The embargo was raised on the 30th day of April, 1920, and freight cars, as requested, were placed for appellant on May 1, 1920. The hogs were then shipped by appellant to Kansas City, Missouri.</p>

The circuit court was right in directing a verdict for appellee. It is true that railroad companies are bound to have all reasonable and necessary facilities and appliances for conducting and carrying on their business in a prompt, skilful, and careful manner, but they are not bound to be prepared for unusual contingencies which no ordinary prudence or foresight could reasonably foresee or anticipate. So that it has been held in this State, where, an unusual <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>contingency has arisen winch unexpectedly increases the business of a railroad company, it will be excused for delaying shipping, or even in receiving goods for shipment, until such goods can, in the regular and usual course of business, be removed. <em>St. L.

    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[330,1227,1204,607]]]'>It appears from the record that a switchmen’s strike in the city of Kansas City, Missouri,'caused all railroads which entered that city to refuse to receive freight from connecting carriers. The line of the .defendant’s railroad only extended from Ratcliff to Fort Smith, Arkansas. On account of the embargo on freight consigned to Kansas City, Missouri, it did not receive the shipment of hogs in question. The strike was not in any manner induced or caused by appellee. It had nothing whatever to do with it, and the embargo placed on freight consigned to Kansas City prevented it from receiving the ■hogs for shipment. .</p>

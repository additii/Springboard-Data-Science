The former is a -wholesale grocer, and the latter runs a sawmill. It is admitted that the plaintiff furnished a bill of groceries to the defendant in the sum of $375. It appears from the testimony of the defendant that the goods were shipped to it on account of Leving Fraser, and that it was in no wise indebted to the plaintiff .for the groceries. Leving Fraser was a farmer in Craighead County, and had a good crop of potatoes, but no way to house them. He wanted to make some arrangements to get lumber sawed to build a potato-house. He told the manager of the defendant that he had no money, and the latter refused to saw the lumber for him unless he could make arrangements for groceries for the men to live on while they were sawing the lumber. <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>The defendant offered to furnish him the lumber on that condition. In a few days Fraser came back and said that he had arranged for a credit of $375 for the defendant with the plaintiff, and told the defendant to proceed with the work. The groceries were shipped out at different times by the plaintiff to the defendant, and about a month afterwards the defendant received a statement of the account from the plaintiff. The defendant’s manager called up Fraser and asked him about it. Fraser said that he would call the plaintiff up about it, and later called up the defendant, and said that he had called up the plaintiff and had arranged the matter with it. No groceries were shipped by the plaintiff to the defendant after that time. Some months later the defendant received a letter from the plaintiff stating that the potato house of Fraser had burned down, and that the plaintiff was looking to the defendant for the sum of $375, the amount of the grocery bill. Evidence for the defendant also tends to show that no further statement of the account was ever sent it by the plaintiff.</p>

The circuit-court found that the merchandise sued for was sold upon the credit of Leving Fraser and charged to him, and that plaintiff was not entitled to recover from the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b553-6" data-blocks='[["BL_553.9",553,[184,1286,1205,972]]]'>Counsel for the plaintiff insists that the court erred in so holding. We have not set out the testimony of the plaintiff on this point in detail, for we are not concerned with the weight of the evidence. It is sufficient, upon appeal to affirm the judgment of a circuit court sitting as a jury, for us to find that there is some sub-tantial evidence in the record to support the judgment. The testimony of the manager of the defendant ■ ánd of Fraser is sufficient for that purpose. It appears from his testimony that he agreed to saw up some lumber for Leving Fraser, with which to build a potato-house, in consideration that Fraser would furnish him groceries to the amount of $375 to feed his men while they were sawing the lumber. It appears from the testimony of Fraser that he made arrangements for the plaintiff to ship to the defendant groceries to the amount of $375 and charge the same to his own account. This evidence is-sufficient to support the judgment of the circuit court on this point.</p>

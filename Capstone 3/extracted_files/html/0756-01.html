McBride and E. B. Folse, who are all residents of the State of Louisiana, entered into an agreement for the purchase of certain lands in Boone County, Arkansas, from Ralph Jefferson. It was orally agreed between these parties that Jefferson would deposit a deed to the lands in the Citizens’ Bank &amp; Trust Company, of Harrison, Arkansas, and the plaintiffs should remit the purchase price of the lands to the bank for payment to Jefferson upon the performance of certain conditions agreed upon 'by the parties.</blockquote>

Hudspeth deposited, without the knowledge or consent of these plaintiffs, in the said Citizens’ Bank &amp; Trust Company, of Harrison, Arkansas, on August 15, 1931, to his personal account, and caused to be issued to himself a certificate of deposit therefor.”</p>
    <p id="b778-5" data-blocks='[["BL_778.4",778,[282,727,1202,557]]]'>In addition to the stipulation as to the facts, a deposition was read in evidence to the effect that on August 12,1931, Hudspeth sent to Folse, at Bastrop, Louisiana, a telegram which, in substance, directed Folse to remit $1,500 either to the Bankers’ Trust Company or to the Union Trust Company, of Little Bock, Arkansas, for the account of the 'Citizens ’ Bank &amp; Trust Company, of Harrison, Arkansas; but, as appears from the facts already stated, the remittance was not made in this manner. On the contrary, it was made directly to Hudspeth in the form of checks payable to his individual order.</p>

No doubt the plaintiffs intended to make a special deposit, but a deposit of that character was not made. Indeed, they made no deposit of any character. The deposit made was by Hudspeth individually, and there is no record in the bank showing that plaintiffs became creditors of the bank, either general or special.</p>

In answer to this contention, it may be first said that this letter was not written until three days after Hudspeth had received checks, payable to his own order, and not to that of the bank, and had deposited them to the credit of his personal account. Moreover, this letter indicates that even then the deed had not been placed in the bank.</p>
    <p id="b779-12" data-blocks='[["BL_779.11",779,[189,2104,1198,344]]]'>The court found the fact to be that, in the transaction stated, “A. T. Hudspeth was acting for himself, and not for said Citizens’ Bank &amp; Trust 'Company,” and we think the testimony supports this finding of fact. Hudspeth advised Folse that, “if you send fifteen hundred,” the note and deed would be mailed, and that direction was followed.</p>

    <p id="b780-5" data-blocks='[["BL_780.4",780,[288,609,1204,1377]]]'>It was said, in the case of <em>Little Red River Levee District No. 2 </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em><a href="/citations/?q=154%20Ark.%2082" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="154 Ark. 82">154 Ark. 82</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=242%20S.W.%20555" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="242 S.W. 555">242 S. W. 555</a>, that: <em>“A </em>corporation must necessarily act through agents, and the universal rule is that knowledge of an agent is ordinarily to be imputed to the principal; but there is an exception to that rule that such knowledge of the agent will not be imputed to the principal where the agent acts for himself or has a personal interest in the transaction, thus rendering it improbable that he will report his knowledge to his principal. <em>Bank of Hartford </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em><a href="/ark/107/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="107 Ark. 232" data-case-ids="1344047" data-case-paths="/ark/107/0232-01">107 Ark. 232</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20S.W.%20512" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="154 S.W. 512">154 S. W. 512</a>. This exception to the general rule has been, in many instances, extended to eases where an officer of a corporation acts for another corporation. Under these circumstances, the officer is treated as having a personal interest in the transaction, and his knowledge is not to be imputed to the corporation which he serves. This exception, however, to the rule does not extend to instances where an officer of a corporation acts as its sole representative or agent Jn the transaction under review. The reason for the exception fails where the officer of the corporation is its sole representative, and especially where, as in the present case, the officer is the corporation itself, without accountability to any superior. It would be entirely beyond reason or justice to hold that a person acting as the agent of both parties could wrongfully transfer property of one of his principals to the other.”</p>

L., page 564, appears this statement of the law: ‘ ‘ The cases hold that the act of the cashier, by which he appropriates exclusively to himself a gratuitous special deposit in the bank, is not am act done in the bank’s business, and within the scope of his employment. The custody of the deposit implies no act to be done, but only a mere continuance of possession until a return of the property is demanded. The cashier has nothing to do with refer<a id="p761" href="#p761" data-label="761" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*761</a>ence to it except suffer it to remain in a safe place of deposit. Consequently, in taking it to himself, he is said to ‘step aside’ from his employment to do an act for his personal gain, regardless of the business for which he was engaged. Such an act is lacking both in the rendition of, and in the intent to render, any service to the employer. The cashier does not, as a matter of fact, act with the bank’s authority, and, furthermore, does not essay, or even profess, to act in its behalf. He represents nobody but himself. He throws off all allegiance to his master and takes the part of a common enemy to all concerned. He becomes the same as a stranger from without, who by robbery, burglary, or stealth deprives the bank of a special deposit; and the authorities hold that the bank is not chargeable with such a loss, in the absence of gross negligence, though it is liable if grossly negligent. Such a fraud, by a well-selected servant, duly supervised, is not to be imputed to the bank as its own fraud. The bank cannot be said to have stolen when there is on its own part no participation in the theft, no appropriation, and no intent to appropriate the property. Of course, if the bank derives profit or benefit from its servant’s speculation, it is liable.”</p>

Had the checks been payable to the order of the bank, a different question would be presented which we are not required to discuss.</p>

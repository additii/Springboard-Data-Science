The testimony showed, as the court found, that the insured was insane when the March assessment became due, and continued so until his death. The appellant insists that there was no provision in its constitution and bylaws, when the forfeiture for nonpayment of the March dues was claimed, exempting insuredâ€™s failure to pay his assessment or relieving against the forfeiture for failure to pay such dues, and such appears to be the case.</p>

He was charged and paid 25 cents monthly for such unauthorized camp dues, and because thereof was entitled to credit for the payments made therefor and had on hand to his credit when the March assessment was required to be paid an amount more than sufficient to pay the said March assessment; and said amount should have been applied to the payment thereof, it being the money of the insured, which would have prevented the forfeiture relied on by appellants.

Here the bylaws of the association state that the camp dues shall be fixed under the bylaws of the particular camp of which he is a member, and, Loyal Camp No. 555 having no bylaws, the camp dues were fixed by the president, who was not a member of said camp (neither do any of the other officials belong to said camp) and since the failure to pay dues wrongfully assessed could not cause a forfeiture of the policy, certainly dues wrongfully assessed and paid would still be the property of the insured in the hands of the association applicable to payment of the March assessment to prevent a forfeiture of the policy, and should have been so applied. <em>Gallegly </em>v. <em>American Ins.

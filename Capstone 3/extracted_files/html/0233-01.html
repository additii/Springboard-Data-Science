Because PERS Plan 1 and TRS Plan 1 provide substantially the same benefits, they will together be referred to as “Plan 1.” On October 1,1977, the legislature eliminated Plan 1 as an option for new employees, replacing Plan 1 with Plan 2 and later adding Plan 3 as a second option. Current Plan 1 members therefore all entered state employment before October 1, 1977. Plan 1 is a defined benefit plan where, after retirement, members are paid a fixed monthly pension amount irrespective of their level of contribution. A statutory formula determines Plan 1 members’ pension amounts, looking to the members’ years of service and average compensation level during their highest two consecutive years. <em>See </em>RCW 41.32.498; RCW 41.40.185 (outlining that the Plan 1 annual retirement allowance shall be two percent of the employee’s average final compensation for each service credit year). Plan 1 is contributory; the benefit is paid out of contributions from the employer and the employee, as well as investment returns on prior contributions. Employee contribution is capped, whereas the employer contribution level can vary with need and is set by the legislature biennially. As it originally stood, Plan 1 did not include any adjustment for changes in cost of living.</p>

Beginning in the early 1970s, the legislature enacted a series of cost of living adjustments (COLAs) that <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>were limited to specific groups and time periods. In 1973, the legislature provided an adjustment based on a cost of living factor. This COLA stated that an adjustment “shall” be made, “provided, that the department finds, at its sole discretion” that the system assets could fund the COLA. Former RCW 41.32.499 (1994) (capitalization omitted); former RCW 41.40.195 (1994). Under this scheme, COLAs were never granted to TRS Plan 1 employees and were granted only through 1980 to PERS Plan 1 employees. Hence, for the 15 years prior to the creation of a uniform COLA system in 1995, DRS never exercised its discretion to grant a COLA under the 1973 provision. In subsequent years, the legislature enacted three other COLAs to benefit discrete populations of the state employee community: minimum retirement allowance recipients, retirees whose benefit had lost a specified amount of its purchasing power, and retirees who were at least 70 years old.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Laws of 1995, ch. 345, § 1. UCOLA repealed the 1973 COLA and the purchasing power COLA, and made the age-70 COLA permanent for those already receiving it. Final B.

UCOLA also replaced the old minimum benefit COLA with a new minimum allowance of $24.22 per year of <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>service, to be adjusted annually for cost of living in the same manner as all pensions.

Former RCW 41.32.489(6); former RCW 41.40.197(6). “The legislature reserves the right to amend or repeal this section in the future and no member or beneficiary has a contractual right to receive this postretirement adjustment not granted prior to that time.” Former RCW 41.32.489(6); former RCW 41.40.197(6).</p>

Laws of 2011, ch. 362, § 1 (“The legislature now finds that changing economic conditions have also made <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>necessary the amendatory provisions contained in this act”). Because employee contribution to Plan 1 was capped and the legislature was reluctant to force employers to contribute more, UCOLA was being funded primarily with current Plan 1 assets. Plan 1 thus became underfunded, and the legislature responded with repeal. Under the terms of the repeal, the annual increase amount will cease increasing by three percent each year. Instead, it will remain locked at the July 1, 2010 amount per service year. RCW 41.32.489(1); RCW 41.40.197(1). Retirees already receiving pension payments will not lose the UCOLA amounts that have already been designated to them but in the future will receive pensions as adjusted on July 1,2010 rather than the current year. Plan 1 employees who have not yet retired will not receive any UCOLA adjustments. RCW 41.32-.489(l)(b) (“After July 1, 2010, no annual increase amounts may be provided to any beneficiaries who are not already receiving benefits under this section.”); RCW 41.40-.197(l)(b) (same). The legislature excluded the minimum benefit COLA from the repeal and in fact increased the minimum benefit amount. RCW 41.32.4851; RCW 41.40-.1984. The minimum benefit thus continues to be adjusted upward each year. The state actuary estimates that the repeal of UCOLA will save the state over seven billion dollars over the next 25 years.</p>

Employees do not contribute to the UCOLA, and the adjustment provided is not “pay withheld to induce continued faithful service” in the same way that a basic pension plan is. <em>Jacoby, </em>77 Wn.2d at 915; <em>see also Bakenhus, </em>48 Wn.2d at 700 (quoting <em>Giannettino v.

Whereas a basic pension plan is deferred compensation and <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>induces long and faithful service over time, a COLA merely enhances the value of the basic pension payment by adjusting for inflation and cost of living increases. Surely the legislature can make the addition of such a bonus subject to its right to amend or repeal the program in the future.

The respondents contend that the 1973 COLA provided a concrete benefit because it required DRS to consider the system’s capacity to fund a COLA each year. Yet the 1973 statute made the ultimate decision subject to DRS’s discretion, which in practice DRS rarely chose to exercise.

At the time class members began working prior to 1977, their employment contract did not include any automatic COLA adjustment. Employees who started after 1973 obtained the possibility of an ad hoc COLA, but the 1973 COLA was different in kind from the UCOLA because it was explicitly discretionary and was contingent on the availability of adequate funding. In both statutory language and fact, the UCOLA system of annual COLA adjustments represented a substantial improvement over the 1973 COLA. Notwithstanding its reservation clause, UCOLA provided a guaranteed right to an annual COLA of increasing amounts for as long as the program remained in effect. In contrast, the 1973 COLA did not provide any certain <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>COLA benefits but merely assured employees that the DRS would <em>consider </em>whether a COLA was practicable based on current funding levels. DRS rarely found adequate funding and granted a COLA, whereas retired Plan 1 members received yearly COLAs of steadily increasing amounts throughout the years that UCOLA was in effect. Although the UCOLA statute reserved the legislature’s right to change or terminate the program, such reservation clauses are enforceable and even the creation of an undefined automated COLA system constitutes an added favorable benefit to the existing Plan 1 pension rights. When the legislature implemented the UCOLA scheme in 1995, it created a favorable modification to the Plan 1 employees’ pension contract. We reject the respondents’ argument that the 1995 UCOLA substantially impaired class members’ rights by eliminating the 1973 COLA.</p>

In 1993, the legislature enacted an “age-70 COLA,” which granted a one-time increase of three dollars per year of service to retirees who were at least 70 years old as of July 1,1993, had been retired for at least five years, and were not already receiving either the Plan 1 COLA or the minimum retirement allowance. Former RCW 41.32.4871 (1994); former RCW 41.40.1983 (1994).</p>

Former RCW 41.31.010 (2006); former RCW 41.31.020 (2006); former RCW 41.31A.020 (2006). Like UCOLA, the gain-sharing legislation reserved the right of the legislature to amend or repeal gain sharing and advised that it was not creating any contractual rights. Former RCW 41.31.030 (2006). In 2007, the legislature repealed gain sharing, and a group of employees and unions challenged the repeal as an unconstitutional impairment of contract. We accepted review and designated the two cases to be heard together as companions.</p>

      <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>In the mortgage executed, by the Davidsons to J. H. Cole the $6,000 note was described as follows: “Whereas, the said J. F. Davidson and B. Davidson are justly indebted unto the said J. II. Cole in the sum of six thousand and no/100 dollars, evidenced by a promissory note of even date for six thousand dollars, with interest from date at the rate of ten per -cent, per annum, if interest be not paid at interest paying time to become principal and bear the same rate of interest.” The note was not stamped with an internal revenue stamp, and appellant objected to its introduction in evidence for that reason, which objection was overruled by the court.</p>
    <p id="b607-3" data-blocks='[["BL_607.4",607,[91,1039,1200,302]]]'>The trial court rendered a judgment against J. F. Davidson in favor of appellant and appellee, J. H.

    <p id="b607-4" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[93,1356,1198,356]]]'>Appellant contends that the court erred in giving preference to the lien of said appellee for three reasons.

      <a class="bracketnum" href="#b605-6" id="ref_b605-6">(1)</a> The objection made to the description of the lands was that the words “section” before 35, “township” before 10, and “range” before 30, must be inferred in order to definitely describe the lands. We do not think the certainty of the description was dependent upon mere inference. The lands were described as being in Crawford County, Arkansas. The calls in the first part of each description referred unmistakably to United States Grovernment surveys. In government surveys lands are described as being in -sections, townships and ranges in the order mentioned. It is a necessary implication therefore that the figures 35-10-30, used in connection with government surveys, mean section 35, town<a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>ship 10, range 30. The base line is south and the meridian line east of Crawford County, so the lands are situated necessarily in township 10 north, range 30 west. We do not think a surveyor would have any trouble in locating the lands from the description in the mortgage.</p>

New Cingular opted for the “actual informal hearing” with the mayor.

Nonetheless, Clyde Hill argues here that New Cingular’s participation in the city’s administrative process and the Court of Appeals’ ruling “makes a mockery of the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement,” “completely undermines the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies,” and makes a local jurisdiction’s administrative procedures meaningless. Pet. for Review at 19, 20. Yet, Clyde Hill fails to cite any precedent to support such claims. New Cingular challenged Clyde Hill’s fine using all administrative remedies the city code afforded. New Cingular submitted a written protest to the fine and elected to partake in the “actual informal hearing” with the mayor. It was not until after the mayor issued a final decision that New Cingular filed a declaratory action in superior court. No other administrative review is established or required under Clyde Hill’s ordinances. To the extent we need to address this argument, we find that New Cingular exhausted all administrative avenues before seeking judicial review.</p>

The city asserts that the Court of Appeals erred in allowing New Cingular to “circumvent the administrative process” by seeking declaratory judgment. Pet. for Review at 9. Clyde Hill maintains that New Cingular was limited to challenging the mayor’s final determination of the fine, rather than the underlying fine itself, and could do so only by seeking a writ of review. The city relies by analogy to the Land Use Petition Act (LUPA), chapter 36.70C RCW, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), chapter 34.05 RCW, and the Growth Management Act (GMA), chapter 36.70A RCW, to argue that the writ of review statute mandates similar, exclusive procedural requirements.

    <p id="b658-3" data-blocks='[["BL_658.4",658,[201,912,1253,594]]]'>¶18 LUPA, the APA, and the GMA all channel initial decision-making power into inferior agencies and boards, and specify procedures a party must use. A party may then seek a writ of review to (1) claim that an inferior tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial functions has exceeded its jurisdiction or (2) ask a court to correct any erroneous or void proceeding or a proceeding not according to the course of common law, as long as the party has no adequate remedy at law. RCW 7.16.040. In its simplest form, the writ of review is a procedure used to review the acts and decisions of an inferior tribunal <em>when no other remedy is available.</em>

The writ of review statute does not limit itself to being the exclusive remedy for contesting a city fine. In fact, it does the opposite by holding itself out as the remedy of last resort. RCW 7.16.040 (a writ may be granted only when there is no “appeal, nor in the judgment of the court, any plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law”). Chapter 7.16 RCW contains no specified purpose similar to LUPA, the APA, and the GMA. The writ statute also fails to specify a time limit for appeal like these statutory schemes. Specific conditional statutory systems are, in fact, “other remedies” available depending on the subject matter of the claim. Had New Cingular’s complaint fallen into the category of land use, administrative, or development decisions, one of these <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>procedural regimens might have been the appropriate avenue to seek review. However, the inverse exists here because a municipal fine does not fall into any of these specific categories. We find nothing in RCW 7.16.040 establishing a similar procedural system.</p>

Br. at 14. By doing so, Clyde Hill ignores the statutory differences between the writ of review statute and the statutory schemes that govern land use, administrative, and development decisions outlined above. The city also disregards CR 57, which limits <em>Reeder. </em>CR 57 provides, “The existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a judgment for declaratory relief in cases where it is appropriate.” The Court of Appeals found that “the bar erected by <em>Reeder </em>is no longer absolute after the adoption in 1967 of CR 57, as recognized by <em>Ronken v. Board of County Commissioners, </em><a href="/wash-2d/89/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="89 Wash. 2d 304" data-case-ids="1108632" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/89/0304-01">89 Wn.2d 304</a>, 310, <a href="/citations/?q=572%20P.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="572 P.2d 1">572 P.2d 1</a> (1977).” <em>New Cingular, </em><a href="/wash-app/187/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="187 Wash.

In that case, we held that it was appropriate for the workers to seek declaratory relief against the commissioners because <em>Reeder </em>no longer controlled the issue of whether a party was precluded from seeking declaratory relief when a writ process was available. We found that “[t]he rule previously followed by Washington . . . that declaratory relief will not lie where any alternative remedy is available, was changed by court rule [CR 57] in 1967.” <em>Ronken, </em>89 Wn.2d at 310.

City of Lakewood, </em><a href="/wash-2d/178/0635-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="178 Wash. 2d 635" data-case-ids="4297984" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/178/0635-01">178 Wn.2d 635</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=310%20P.3d%20804" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="310 P.3d 804">310 P.3d 804</a> (2013), which permitted a local business (CMS) to seek declaratory action in superior court against the city of Lakewood. In that case, CMS discovered it had been paying taxes to the city it did not in fact owe and sought a tax refund. The city did not respond to CMS’s refund request. Instead, six months later, Lakewood issued an order and notice to CMS demanding payment of what it considered CMS’s past due taxes. CMS did not respond to the order and notice from the city, but sued Lakewood in superior court. We held that CMS was permitted to seek declaratory judgment in superior court because “Lakewood’s inaction in response to CMS’s refund request ended CMS’s obligation to continue pursuing” an administrative remedy. <em>Cost Mgmt. Servs., </em>178 Wn.2d at 642. In that case, original jurisdiction in superior court sprung from the city’s failure to respond. The same is true here. New Cingular asserts that the city of Clyde Hill failed to respond to its refund request. Clyde Hill, instead, issued an NOV claiming New Cingular perpetrated fraud. To remedy the situation for its client, New Cingular’s counsel pursued both an administrative solution through the city’s informal hearing process and also sought judicial review in superior court after the mayor’s determination. Our holding in <em>Cost Management Services </em>supports this course of action. Where a local government fails to respond to a tax refund request and exercise its administrative capacity, a party therefore is authorized to seek a remedy by invoking the original jurisdiction of the superior court. That is what New Cingular did here.</p>

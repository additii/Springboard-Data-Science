The contract provided that Davidson was to convey to Crowe, free of all incumbrances, certain lands in Mississippi County, Arkansas, and Crowe agreed to convey, and did convey, to Davidson certain lands in Prairie County, Arkansas, subject to a government loan in the sum of $7,000, which Davidson assumed and agreed to pay. The contract also provided that Crowe was to retain possession of the Prairie County land for the years of 1930 and 1931, rent free, and further, as a part of the consideration, Crowe agreed to lease the Prairie County land for the year 1932 for the sum of $3,600, and agreed to execute and deliver a note for this amount.

Davidson assumed and agreed to pay an indebtedness of $7,000, which was a lien on the lands in Prairie County. Crowe agreed to keep the lands and rent them for the year 1932 for $3,600. The contract, however, expressly states that, as a part of the consideration of this exchange of properties, the party of the second part agrees to rent or lease the land from the party of the first part for the year 1932 for $3,600. In the suit brought in the Mississippi court, the plaintiff alleged that this $3,600 was a part of the consideration, that it had not been paid, and that he was entitled tof a lien on the lands in Mississippi County to secure the payment. If this was a part of the consideration entitling the plaintiff in the case to a lien on the lands in Mississippi County, the court had jurisdiction.</p>

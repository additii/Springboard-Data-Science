The Luis’ insurance policy for the building limited coverage for water damage in two ways based on vacancy: coverage was suspended if the building remained vacant for 60 consecutive days and, effective at the beginning of any vacancy, there was no coverage for certain specified losses, including water damage. The Luis argue that the policy is ambiguous and should be interpreted in the Luis’ favor to mean that the exclusion of coverage for water damage would commence only after a 60-day vacancy. We reject the Luis’ arguments and find that the policy unambiguously excluded coverage for water damage immediately upon vacancy. We reverse the trial court’s contrary holding and affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>

    <p id="b761-5" data-blocks='[["BL_761.4",761,[202,500,1247,317]]]'>¶2 The Luis owned a building containing tenant space. The building’s last tenant, the Agape Foundation Inc., left the building in the first week of December 2010 after being evicted by the Luis for failure to pay rent. At the time of the incidents giving rise to this claim, the Luis were not renting the building to a tenant.</p>
    <p id="b761-6" data-blocks='[["BL_761.5",761,[201,841,1248,476]]]'>¶3 On or about January 1, 2011, less than 60 days after the Agape Foundation Inc. moved out of the building, a frozen sprinkler pipe broke in the building and caused substantial water damage to the building. Upon discovering the water damage, the Luis notified their insurance provider, Essex Insurance Company, and filed a claim. Essex began investigating the Luis’ claim and paid the Luis a total of $293,598.05 for property damage during the course of its investigation.</p>
    <p id="b761-7" data-blocks='[["BL_761.6",761,[202,1341,1246,421]]]'>¶4 After paying this sum, Essex discovered that the property was vacant at the time of the water damage. Essex then denied the Luis’ claim and refused to pay any more money. In denying the Luis’ claim, Essex sent their attorney a letter explaining that the endorsement in the Luis’ insurance policy excluded coverage for the water damage because it occurred while the building was vacant. The letter explained Essex’s reasoning as follows:</p>

The insurance company was never notified of the vacancy until after the loss, and hence never approved coverage beyond the named perils listed in the Endorsement. The cause of the January 1, 2011 loss was not one of the perils named in the Change of Conditions Endorsement. Therefore, the insurance company cannot provide coverage for the claimed loss.</blockquote>
    <p id="b762-5" data-blocks='[["BL_762.4",762,[202,786,1246,208]]]'>In addition, the letter stated that Essex would refrain from seeking reimbursement for the money that Essex had already paid to the Luis on condition that the Luis would not pursue their claim any further.</p>
    <p id="b762-6" data-blocks='[["BL_762.5",762,[201,1020,1253,913]]]'>¶5 The Luis sued Essex, claiming total damages in the amount of $758,863.31. Both the Luis and Essex filed cross motions for summary judgment. Essex argued that the unambiguous language of the “Change in Condition Endorsement” (the endorsement) in the Luis’ insurance policy immediately suspends coverage at the inception of any vacancy for all but specifically named causes of loss. Because the property was vacant and water damage was not one of the named causes of loss, Essex argued that the court should rule that the Luis were not entitled to coverage as a matter of law. The Luis argued that coverage restrictions from their policy’s “Vacancy Provisions” become effective if the property is vacant for a period of 60 consecutive days. Further, the Luis sought summary judgment on the grounds that (1) Essex was estopped from denying coverage, (2) Essex waived its right to deny coverage, and (3) Essex denied the coverage in bad faith.</p>
    <p id="b762-7" data-blocks='[["BL_762.6",762,[197,1957,1252,414]],["BL_763.1",763,[202,345,1247,414]]]'>¶6 The trial court denied Essex’s motion for summary judgment and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Luis solely on its conclusion that the endorsement was internally ambiguous and, therefore, had to be construed as providing coverage for the water damage. Specifically, the trial court stated, “The court finds there is a conflict in the two paragraphs of the change of conditions endorsement.” The court resolved the conflict in favor of the <a id="p709" href="#p709" data-label="709" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*709</a>Luis, holding that the word “inception” from the endorsement “does not suspend coverage automatically.” The court acknowledged that it was ruling only on the “narrow issue” that there was “a conflict in the language” of the endorsement. Thus, the court declined to grant summary judgment on the Luis’ waiver, estoppel, and bad faith claims, stating that there are questions of material fact that govern those issues.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b763-5" data-blocks='[["BL_763.4",763,[202,790,1252,422]]]'>¶7 Essex moved for reconsideration and asked in the alternative that the court certify the ruling for appeal under RAP 2.3(b)(4). The court denied Essex’s motion for reconsideration but did certify its ruling for review. In certifying its ruling for review, the court also ordered “that all further action in this Court involving the Luis’ claims against Essex are severed and stayed pending resolution of Essex’ appeal to the Court of Appeals.”</p>
    <p id="b763-6" data-blocks='[["BL_763.5",763,[197,1235,1256,530]]]'>¶8 The Court of Appeals accepted review on the certified issue of whether the provisions within the endorsement were ambiguous. In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s order granting summary judgment in favor of the Luis. The Court of Appeals ruled that the plain language of the endorsement unambiguously limited coverage to only the enumerated causes of loss at the moment the building became vacant, not after 60 days as the Luis argued. The Luis then filed a petition for review with this court, which we granted.</p>

We give undefined terms in an insurance policy their popular and ordinary meaning in accord with the understanding of the average purchaser of insurance, which we may determine by reference to dictionary definitions. <em>Queen City Farms, Inc., </em>126 Wn.2d at 77. The ordinary meaning of “suspended” to the average insured is that there is no insurance coverage “beyond” 60 days of vacancy. Indeed, the dictionary definition of “sus<a id="p714" href="#p714" data-label="714" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*714</a>pended” is “temporarily debarred, inactive, inoperative : held in abeyance.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 2303 (2002). Similarly, the average insured would understand “beyond” to mean after the 60 days of vacancy, which is again confirmed by the dictionary definition. <em>See id. </em>at 210 (“beyond” means “farther away or farther along in space, time, or any developing temporal activity”). Therefore, the average insured would understand that the first paragraph of the endorsement ends all insurance coverage if less than 31 percent of the building has been rented or used for its customary operations for more than 60 consecutive days.</p>

      <a id="p715" href="#p715" data-label="715" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*715</a>¶20 The policy reasoning for vacancy provisions supports this plain language reading. Potentially damaging conditions in a vacant building are more likely to go undiscovered. <em>See Rojas v. Scottsdale Ins. </em>Co., <a href="/neb/267/0922-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="267 Neb. 922" data-case-ids="3653050" data-case-paths="/neb/267/0922-01">267 Neb. 922</a>, 929-30, <a href="/neb/267/0922-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="267 Neb. 922" data-case-ids="3653050" data-case-paths="/neb/267/0922-01">678 N.W.2d 527</a> (2004).

Indeed, the facts of this case highlight the risks to a vacant building and why an insurance company would include such a vacancy endorsement. Because the Luis’ building was vacant, the water leak went unnoticed until someone called the fire department to report “water coming from a building.” Had the Luis or a tenant occupied the building, the response time and resulting damage may have been reduced.</p>
    <p id="b769-5" data-blocks='[["BL_769.4",769,[201,1297,1253,649]]]'>¶21 The Luis argue that the structure of the endorsement leads to a different conclusion. The Luis assert that the endorsement can reasonably be read to mean that there are no coverage consequences at all until after 60 days of vacancy. The Luis make this argument based on the order of the two paragraphs of the endorsement—that the first paragraph is the “dominant concept” of the endorsement and controls the reading of the second paragraph. Specifically, the Luis state that because the first paragraph prescribes the coverage consequences of 60 days of vacancy, the second paragraph can reasonably be read as also not effective until after 60 days of vacancy.</p>

If we were to accept the Luis’ assertion that insurance consequences do not exist until after 60 days of vacancy, the phrase “effective, at the inception of any vacancy” in the endorsement’s second paragraph becomes meaningless in light of the first paragraph’s statement that “coverage under this policy is suspended while a described building ... is vacant or unoccupied beyond a period of sixty consecutive days.” The Luis’ interpretation of the endorsement further creates an unresolvable contradiction where the first paragraph would cause all coverage to be suspended while the second paragraph would simultaneously provide limited coverage.</p>

While the Vacancy Provisions section of the underlying policy may have excluded coverage for water damage only after 60 days of vacancy, the endorsement changes the terms of the policy to exclude coverage for water damage at the inception of any vacancy. <em>See Transcon. Ins. Co., </em>111 Wn.2d at 462 (endorsement provisions control over underlying policy provisions if so stated in the endorsement). The Luis’ argument is unavailing because it ignores the controlling nature of the endorsement. We must read the insur-<a id="p717" href="#p717" data-label="717" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*717</a>anee policy as a whole, including endorsements that explicitly change the terms of the policy. RCW 48.18.520; <em>see also Transcon. Ins. Co., </em>111 Wn.2d at 462. In this case, the endorsement excludes coverage for water damage in the first 60 days of a vacancy. To interpret these provisions to the contrary would cause the endorsement’s language that it changes the underlying policy to either be superfluous or be in direct conflict with the Vacancy Provisions. <em>See Quadrant Corp., </em>154 Wn.2d at 170 (we may not create an ambiguity where none exists). Because the Luis’ interpretation of the endorsement and the overall insurance policy is unreasonable, it does not create an ambiguity that must be resolved in their favor.</p>

Specifically, the Luis claim that the Court of Appeals inappropriately construed the policy based on what the court presumed the Luis knew about Essex’s interpretation of the policy. In a footnote, the Court of Appeals elaborated on the fact that the Luis had a prior insurance policy with Essex in 2004, and that the coverage under that prior policy was partially suspended when Essex discovered that the insured building was vacant. <em>Kut Suen Lui v.

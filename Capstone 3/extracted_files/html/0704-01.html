The testimony on the part of the appellees tends to show that, before any action looking to the sale of the property was made by appellees to appellant, appellees had sold lot 11 in block 6 to Sanford. They not only testified to this, but testified that this fact was stated to J. N. Ward, appellant, when he was on the deal for the property. Witnesses for appellant deny this. The testimony is in hopeless conflict, and it would serve no useful purpose to set it out at length.</p>
    <p id="b727-14" data-blocks='[["BL_727.15",727,[117,1576,1209,549]]]'>The appellant’s first contention is that the contract between the parties was in writing, and that parol evidence is inadmissible to vary or contradict the terms of the written contract. But does the oral testimony in this case vary or contradict the terms of the written contract? .The contract says: “Confirming my proposition relative to buying the property of the Arkansas Cold Storage &amp; Ice Company at Fayetteville and Spring-dale,” etc. It would certainly require oral testimony to show what property the seller had, and oral testimony as to this does not vary the terms of the contract.</p>

The former is not per<a id="p710" href="#p710" data-label="710" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*710</a>missible. The latter is permissible, and is often absolutely essential to show the real nature of the agreement. Both rules are' elementary, and do not conflict in the slightest degree with each other. One prevents a written contract from being varied by parol evidence, either, in regard to what was said at the time it was made or prior thereto; the other aids in determining what the contract is when its language, either in its literal sense or as applied to the facts, is obscure. The one rule is to preservó the contract as expressed in writing; the other is a rule of construction to determine what the contract, as expressed, is, it being kept in mind' that the mutual intention of the parties, so far as the same can be ascertained, governs within the reasonable meaning of the language they chose to express it, and that rules of construction to discover it are not resorted to unless there is some ambiguity to be cleared up. A failure to keep in mind the wide distinction between varying a contract by parol evidence and resorting to such evidence in aid of its construction, often leads to error.” <em>Brown &amp; Hackney </em>v. <em>Daubs, </em><a href="/ark/139/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="139 Ark. 53" data-case-ids="1596361" data-case-paths="/ark/139/0053-01">139 Ark. 53</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20S.W.%204" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="213 S.W. 4">213 S.

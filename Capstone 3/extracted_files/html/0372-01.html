Facts that merely divide a lower degree of a crime from a higher one will rarely meet this standard. Our opinion in <em>Ward </em>is illustrative. <em>Ward </em>concerned domestic violence statutes that made violations of a no-contact order a felony under certain circumstances, including when the violation is accompanied <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>by an assault. <em>Ward, </em>148 Wn.2d at 805 (citing former RCW 10.99.040(4)(b) (1997); former RCW 10.99.050(2) (1997)). Among other things, those statutes provided that “ ‘[a]ny assault that is a violation of an order issued under this chapter ... and that does not amount to assault in the first or second degree under RCW 9A.36.011 or 9A.36.021 is a class C felony.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 810 (alterations in original) (quoting RCW 26.50.110(4) and citing former RCW 10.99.040(4)(b) (1997); former RCW 10.99.050(2) (1997)). While plainly the felony-elevating assault was an element that had to be charged and proved, we found that the statutory language “ ‘does not amount to assault in the first or second degree’ ” did not establish an essential element of the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 806 (quoting RCW 26.50.110(4)). We looked at the purpose of the statute: to ensure that violations of no-contact orders accompanied by assault were punished as felonies. <em>Id. </em>at 813. “The legislature did not need to increase the penalty for first or second degree assault, since in their own right the crimes are class A and B felonies respectively.” <em>Id. </em>at 812.

The house was totally destroyed, and this suit was brought to collect the insurance thereon. The insurance company defended upon the grounds that there had been a change of possession which avoided the policy, and that the insured had not made proof of loss as required by the policy. Liability was denied upon both grounds. The trial resulted in a verdict for the insured for $700, with a penalty of 12 per cent, and an attorney’s fee of $100, and from the judgment therefor is this appeal.</p>

Their separation had been impending for some time, and a brother of appellee had unsuccessfully attempted to effect a reconciliation. As appellee expressed it, he and his wife “divided,” and it appears to have been agreed that he should haul her effects from their residence to the place to which she had decided to remove. Pursuant to this arrangement, appellee’s brother, who was a tenant on the farm where the insured residence was located, moved into the insured property, and appellee’s wife moved out <a id="p769" href="#p769" data-label="769" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*769</a>the following day. Appellee testified that his brother moved in in order that he might take care of the property. His brother had been living in another house on the farm, which he vacated, "and was placed, in the insured house as a caretaker, and no increased rent was charged against his brother.</p>

Appellee secured a divorce, on some ground not stated, and married again, and, after his second marriage, resided in Dardanelle, but he testified that he did this because it made him more accessible to his work, and that he intended at all times to return to his home — the insured property — when his employment terminated, hut the house burned before that time, and that, even after his second marriage, he only removed from the house a feather-bed and some pillows.</p>

The court tells you further that, if his brother went in there as his agent and maintained his residence in that building as Rector’s agent and not as his tenant, then the policy is not void on that account; <a id="p770" href="#p770" data-label="770" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*770</a>* * * if he maintained his possession by either remaining there himself or keeping some one there for him, taking care of his property for him, the court tells you that he did not change his possession. * * *”</p>

In addition to the facts stated above, appellee testified that he told Mr. George, the agent who wrote the policy, that he was staying temporarily in Dardanelle, and that his brother was in charge of the insured property for him, and that George told him that this Would not invalidate the policy. George denied having this conversation. Appellee testified that' he had not put his brother in charge for any definite time, and that he retained the right to reenter and take possession at any time, and that it was his intention always to reoccupy the property when his employment terminated. That the house which his brother vacated when he rémoved into the insured property remained vacant, so that his brother could move back into it when told to do so,-and his brother did return to that house when the insured house burned. He-did not charge his brother any rent, and he kept a portion of his effects in the insured property at all times, and had the right to retake possession on demand. Appellee further testified, as stated, that he had advised the agent, George, of his temporary removal from the property, and that George said that this fact would not affect the insurance. If this be true — -and the jury evidently credited the testimony — the jury was warranted in finding that the agent did not regard the circumstance as being a change of possession. The agent made no attempt to -cancel the policy, and, if there was a change of possession, the question might have been raised whether this provision of the policy had been waived; but that issue was not submitted to the jury. The question of fact submitted was whether there had been a change of possession.</p>

W. 1047</a>, 86 Am. St. 195, the policy sued on contained the stipulation that if “ * * * any change takes place in the title, occupation or possession * * *” of the insured property, the policy should be void. The owner of the property leased it to one Haile for a year, and gave Haile possession thereof, and moved away from the premises, which remained in the exclusive possession of Haile until the house was destroyed by fire. The court held that there had been a change of possession and occupancy and that the policy had been thereby invalidated.</p>

One might be in possession of property which he did not occupy, and one might give another the right to occupy which would deprive the owner of his right of possession, at least for the period of time that the right of occupancy exists. But this is the question which the instruction quoted submitted to the jury. Under the instruction the jury was told to find for the defendant insurance company if it were found that the occupant was not in possession for the owner. The court directed the jury to find for the insurance company if it were found ihat appellee’s brother was in possession as tenant, although the tenancy was at will, but to find for the plaintiff if it were found that appellee’s brother was in pos<a id="p772" href="#p772" data-label="772" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*772</a>session as a mere caretaker.

This is a matter of contract. The insured has the right to determine what insurance he will accept; and, when he enters into a contract with the insurance company in which the property insured is specified, and the insurance is made to depend upon the change of occupancy, he is bound by the contract, and he cannot change the occupancy of the property contrary to the terms of the policy and hold the insurer liable.

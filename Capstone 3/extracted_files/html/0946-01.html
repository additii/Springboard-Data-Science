W. 167</a>, the question was raised as to the power of an agent of a corporation to execute accommodation paper in the name of the corporation, and, after holding that such right was not within the real or apparent scope of the agent’s authority, the court held that such action might be ratified. It was there said:</p>

It also rests on the moral consideration that the former, after allowing the hopes of the latter to be raised for a considerable length of time, in respect of whatever benefits may aeerue’or may have accrued from the engagement, ought not to be allowed to disappoint those hopes. The rule therefore is that, where the agents of a corporation exceed their powers, their principal must, as in the case of a natural person, disaffirm promptly, or at least within a reasonable time, having regard to the circumstances of each case’.”</blockquote>

A round statement of this doctrine is that estoppels <em>in pais </em>operate against cor<a id="p957" href="#p957" data-label="957" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*957</a>porations in like manner as against natural persons.’ And further discussing the doctrine of estoppel as applicable to corporations, at page 1066 of the same volume, says: 'As more fully explained later, the same principle validates the voidable acts of corporations, on the theory of a ratification by the acquiescence of all the shareholders, so that, after, a long delay, in which time other rights have supervened or expectations have been founded, upon the faith of an existing state of facts, the shareholders will be precluded from maintaining actions in equity to undo what has been done by the directors or officers without their authority.’ The same writer, in his work on Corporations (2 Thompson on Corporations, 2 ed., par. 1960, p. 1048), says: 'In the law of agency there is a rule that, if one accepts the benefits of an unauthorized contract made in his behalf 'by another, he is bound by its terms the same as if he had entered into the contract in person or had expressly ratified it, provided, of course, that he had full knowledge of all the facts, and'he is thereby estopped from repudiating the contract without restoring the benefits and putting the other party <em>in statu quo. </em>This principle is applicable, in .its fullest sense, to corporations which, from their nature, can act only through the instrumentality of agents. If therefore an officer of a corporation, or other person, assuming to have power to bind the corporation, by a given contract enters into the contract for the corporation, and the corporation receives the fruits of the contract, and retains them after acquiring- knowledge of the circumstances attending the making of the contract, it will thereby become estopped from afterwards rescinding, or undoing- the contract. In other words, by retaining the fruits of the unauthorized contract, with knowledge of the circumstances which entitle.it to its election either to affirm or disaffirm it, the corporation ratifies the contract and makes it good by adoption.’ In the same volume, at page 1056, it is further said: 'It is not strictly necessary to the proper application of the principle of <a id="p958" href="#p958" data-label="958" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*958</a>estoppel that the corporation should have received a benefit from, the contract, but it is sufficient that the other party has acted on the faith of it to his disadvantage, as where he has expended money on the faith of it. The reason of the rule is that honesty and fair dealing are the highest public policy, and that a private corporation, which is a mere collection of individuals, is no more privileged to repudiate its engagements and act dishonestly than a single individual is’.”</blockquote>

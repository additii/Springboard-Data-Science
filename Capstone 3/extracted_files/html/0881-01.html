Lowell, Arkansas, to Minneapolis, Minnesota. On the bill of lading appears the following notation: “From the EL Rouw Company, the property described below in apparent good order, except as noted.” The berries were bought by the plaintiff, from growers in the neighborhood, for shipment. They were inspected before they were loaded in the car, and were good, firm berries, graded as No. 1. They were ripe, smooth and clean. The car of berries was received by the consignee at St. Paul, Minnesota, on May 26,1924. The car contained 420 crates, and there was considerable decay in them. Other evidence for the plaintiff tended to show that the berries, if properly iced and refrigerated, should have arrived in sound condition. It was also shown that the berries were damaged in the amount sued for.</p>

In the application of the principle of law, instruction No. 7 was wrong and necessarily prejudicial to the plaintiff, because it placed upon it the burden of showing that the defendant failed to exercise ordinary care in keeping- the car in which the berries were shipped properly refrigerated during transit.</p>
    <p id="b901-4" data-blocks='[["BL_901.5",901,[179,1768,1201,454]]]'>Counsel for the defendant claim that the instruction was not erroneous because of a clause in the contract of shipment which provided that, if loss or damage to the berries was claimed to have occurred in transit by the negligence of the defendant, a notice to this effect should be required as a condition precedent to recovery, and that the plaintiff did not prove compliance with this provision of the contract. As bearing on this point, we quote from the record the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b901-5" data-blocks='[["BL_901.6",901,[179,2231,1199,145]]]'>“Mr. Wofford: You don’t raise any question about us making demand for payment of this claim? Mr. Hardin: No sir. We don’t deny that.”</blockquote>

This agreement was made at the close of the testimony, and it is fairly inferable that it was intended to cover the point in question. We think the agreement is broad enough to show that the defendant waived compliance with this provision of the contract. Having’ done so, no assignment of error can be based upon the failure to comply with the provision of the contract. It necessarily follows that the instruction as given is contrary to the principles of law decided in the cases above cited. Therefore the judgment must be reversed, for the error of the court in giving instruction No. 7, and the cause will be remanded for a new trial</p>

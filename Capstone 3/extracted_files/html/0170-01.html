We find that the amendment does change “the uses to which any unit is restricted” under this particular declaration because the declaration provides that leasing is a use, and, therefore, special supermajority approval was required for the amendment. Because the amendment did not receive the required special supermajority approval, we find that the amendment is not valid and affirm the courts below.</p>

Under RCW 64.34.264(1), a condominium declaration may be amended by the vote or agreement of owners to which at least 67 percent of the votes are allocated. RCW 64.34.264(4), however, provides an exception to that general rule, requiring the vote or agreement of the owner of each unit particularly affected and the owners of units to which at least 90 percent of the votes are allocated for an amendment that “may create or increase special declarant rights, increase the number of units, change the boundaries of any unit, the allocated interests of a unit, or <em>the uses to which any unit is restricted </em>.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

In October 2012, Filmore filed a complaint in Whatcom County Superior Court, alleging that the Declaration’s 12th amendment violated RCW 64.34.264(4) and section 17.3 of the Declaration because the 12th amendment was not passed with 90 percent of the eligible votes, and requesting that the 12th amendment be found void and unenforceable. The trial court granted CR 56 summary judgment in favor of Filmore on February 8, 2013, finding that the 12th amendment is void because it was not passed with 90 percent of the eligible votes.

The positioning of section 9.1.14 within the section 9.1 “Permitted Uses” heading indicates that for the purposes of this Declaration, a provision on leasing is one restricting the “use” of a unit—an amendment that requires a 90 percent vote under section 17.3. <em><a href="/citations/?q=226%20P.3d%20131" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="226 P.3d 131">Id.</a> </em>This interpretation is bolstered by the fact that section 9.1.14 also provides that there is “no restriction on the right of any Unit Owner to lease his or her Unit” other than the restrictions set forth in Section 9.1.14, such as that “[a]ll leases shall be in writing” and “[n]o lease shall have a term of less than one year,” and nothing in <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>section 9.1.14 limits the number of units that may be leased. <em>Id. </em>at 55.

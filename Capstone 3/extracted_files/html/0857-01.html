Defendants Daylan Berg and Jeffrey Reed were convicted of robbery in the first degree and kidnapping in the first degree in violation of RCW 9A.56.200 and RCW 9A.40.020. On appeal, Division Two of the Court of Appeals held that because the only evidence of kidnapping was conduct incidental to the robbery, the evidence of kidnapping was insufficient under the due process clause. U.S. Const, amend. XIV, § 1; Wash. Const, art. I, § 3. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals vacated the kidnap<a id="p861" href="#p861" data-label="861" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*861</a>ping convictions.

Watts, resided in Vancouver, Washington, and held a medical marijuana card that permitted him to legally grow marijuana plants. The State’s evidence showed that on the evening of April 15, 2009, Daylan Berg and Jeffrey Reed broke in though the back door of Watts’s garage while Watts was watering his marijuana plants. Reed held a semiautomatic pistol to Watts’s head and ordered him to get on the ground. Watts complied. Responding to Reed’s instructions, Berg held down Watts with his knee while pointing the gun at his head. While Berg restrained Watts, Reed went back and forth between the garage and the house, at some point taking Watts’s wallet and phone and ripping up his marijuana plants.</p>

Whenever Watts tried to move beneath Berg’s knee, Berg threatened that they would kill him. Before leaving the premises, Berg and Reed promised to find and kill Watts if he talked to police about what had transpired. They also told him to remain on the floor for an additional 15 minutes after they left. Watts stayed on the floor for just a few minutes, then got up and eventually connected with police who were already at the scene outside. Later, as Berg and Reed were trying to escape, Sergeant Jay Alie pulled them over and Berg shot the police officer in the chest.</p>

The sufficiency challenge here arises in the context of robbery and kidnapping charges. Accordingly, it is useful to review the elements and the statutory framework for these crimes.</p>

RCW 9A.56.190. If the State proves these basic elements, the defendant may be convicted of robbery in the second degree. RCW 9A.56.210. If, however, the State also proves one of the additional elements outlined in RCW 9A.56.200, the defendant’s conviction may be elevated to robbery in the first degree. In this case, Reed and Berg were convicted of robbery in the first degree because the jury found the State had proved one of these additional elements, namely that “in the commission of a robbery or of immediate flight therefrom” they “[d]isplay[ed] what appeared] to be a firearm or other deadly weapon.” RCW 9A.56.200(l)(a)(ii).</p>

Abduction can be shown by proving either restraint by secretion or restraint by use or threat of deadly force.

Here, Berg and Reed <a id="p864" href="#p864" data-label="864" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*864</a>were convicted of first degree kidnapping because the jury-found they intentionally abducted another person with the intent “ [t] o facilitate commission of any felony or flight thereafter.” RCW 9A.40.020(l)(b).</p>

Brett and his girlfriend randomly selected the home of an elderly, upper-middle class couple to rob and murder. The pair had planned to enter the elderly couple’s home at night, restrain them until morning when their bank opened, force them to withdraw money, and then kill them by lethal injection. Here, their plan derailed when the elderly couple’s security alarm went off and the wife escaped.

The court reasoned that the defendants had an overarching plan to kidnap wealthy elderly people, transport them to their bank to withdraw money, and later kill them. Brett made a similar argument to that of the defendants here — namely, that the State had not proved the abduction element of kidnapping because the restraint was incidental to the murder. <em><a href="/citations/?q=892%20P.2d%2029" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="892 P.2d 29">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=892%20P.2d%2029" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="892 P.2d 29">at 166</a>.

In contrast, the defendants cite <em>Green </em>II and <em>Brett </em>to support their argument that where a kidnapping is incidental to another crime, that evidence is insufficient evidence of kidnapping. In particular, Berg and Reed highlight a secondary observation in <em>Green </em>II in which the court stated:</p>

The petitioner contended that <em>Green </em>II mandated such a holding. But this court disagreed in a succinct discussion of <em>Green </em>II.

Whether the jury had sufficient evidence to convict is a distinct question from whether two convictions should merge. Sufficiency of the evidence considers whether there was enough evidence proffered from which a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the elements of the crime had been proved. Merger accepts that there was sufficient evidence of the elements of the crime but considers further whether the legislature nevertheless intended for one of the offenses to be extinguished because of its redundant consideration within the primary offense. This court has never held that evidence of kidnapping is insufficient where the kidnapping conduct is incidental to another crime as a matter of due process. Instead, kidnapping conduct incidental to another crime has been addressed as an issue of merger and we have held that kidnapping and robbery never merge.</p>

To prove kidnapping in the first degree, the State must show an intentional abduction with intent to facilitate the commission of any felony or flight thereafter. RCW 9A.40.020. Abduction can be proved in three ways; most relevant here is restraint by threat of deadly force. RCW 9A.40.010(1). Restraint, moreover, exists where a person’s movement is restricted without consent in a way that interferes with his or her liberty.

This proof of restraint by threat of death was sufficient for a jury to conclude an abduction occurred. Finally, Berg and Reed were in the process of stealing Watts’s marijuana plants and other possessions when they engaged in this kidnapping conduct. A jury could conclude that Berg and Reed committed the kidnapping with an intent to facilitate the commission of a felony.

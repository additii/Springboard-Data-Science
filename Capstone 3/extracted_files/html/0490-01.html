Plaintiff is a nephew of E. JULadd, who died intestate, about the year 1905, in Independence County. W. M. Wade was appointed administrator of the estate, and made final settlement thereof on May 4, 1908, which was approved and confirmed on November 4, 1908. The complaint was filed September 10, 1920, and plaintiff alleged he had only learned his uncle was dead a few months prior to that date, and that he did not know anything of the administration of the estate and has re<a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>eeived no part of the portion due him as an heir-at-law. That the next of kin of the intestate were his brothers and sisters and the children of deceased brothers and sisters, and that he was the only child of his mother, who was one of the sisters, and that his mother died •several .years 'before the death of the intestate, and that ¡plaintiff’s share was a one-ninth interest. It was further-alleged that “defendants Wade and Wheeler bought up the shares of all the heirs except himself and two others, and, although they knew, or could have known with reasonable investigation, that plaintiff was not dead, and although in the final settlement filed by the defendant Wade as administrator he expressly recoghized the right of plaintiff to a one-ninth interest in said estate, as well as Joe Ladd, whose whereabouts were then unknown, yet subsequently he and the defendant Wheeler secured an order of the probate court of Independence County authorizing him, as administrator, to pay out the amount of said estate belonging to the plaintiff and Joe Ladd to the other heirs-at-law, on the representation made to the court that the plaintiff and Joe Ladd had been absent from the State of Arkansas for five years without their whereabouts being known.” A copy of the order of the probate court was made an exhibit to the complaint. It was further alleged in the complaint that Wade paid to himself 6/42 and to the defendant Wheeler 33/42 of the estate and 3/42 to the other heirs, and that, pursuant to the order of the probate court, I. N. and J. F. Barrett, who were also made defendants, had executed a bond to the administrator for the said Wheeler, guaranteeing the return of the money paid him if the plaintiff or Joe Ladd should turn out to be alive and claim their interests.</p>

Exceptions to this settlement were filed by Wheeler and Wade, upon the ground that neither Ladd nor Hill were entitled to participate in the disbursement of the funds of said estate, for the reason that both had absented themselves beyond the limits of the State for a period of more than five years and nothing had been heard from either within five years, and both were therefore presumed to be dead, under the statutes of the State. The order of the probate court recites that witnesses were examined and sworn on the hearing’ of the exceptions to the administrator’s settlement, and, “being fully advised in the premises, and it appearing to the court that the said Joe .Ladd and George Hill had absented themselves from the limits of the State of Arkansas for a period of more than twenty years, the court is of opinion that said exceptions to the final settlement and account current of the administrator should be sustained. ’ ’</p>

The facts there were that United States Senator Broderick of California died in 1859 and left a very valuable estate. A will purporting to have been executed by him was probated, and his estate was distributed pursuant to its terms. Ten years later a bill was filed by his heirs alleging that will was a forgery, but the court held the heirs were barred by laches. The heirs sought to excuse their delay in instituting the suit by showing that they were residents of an isolated community in Wales, and had lost track of their relative, who had come to America and amassed a fortune, and that they had brought suit as soon as they were advised of the accrual of their cause of action. Mr. Justice Bradley, for the court, said: “They do not pretend that the facts of the fraud were shrouded in concealment, but their plea is that they lived in a remote and secluded region, far from meaps of information, and never heard of Broderick’s death, or of the sale of his property, or of any events connected with the settlement of his estate, until many years after these events had transpired. Parties cannot thus, by their seclusion from the means of information, claim exemption from the laws that control human affairs, and set up a right to open up all the <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>transactions of the past.

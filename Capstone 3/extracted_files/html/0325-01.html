The contention is, we think, unsound. The code of civil practice provides, as one of the grounds for demurrer, that the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue, and that when such matter does not appear upon the face of the complaint, the objection may be made by answer (Kirby’s Digest, secs. 6093-6096). The last section just cited provides that ‘if no such objection is taken, either by demurrer or answer, the defendant shall be deemed to have waived the same.’ It thus appears that the statute itself provides that the incapacity of the plaintiff to sue may be waived by the defendant, and is waived by failing to take advantage of the defense at the time and in the manner pointed out by the statute. The judgment is not void because of the plaintiff’s incapacity to sue, but that defect only • constitutes error which calls for a reversal of the judgment, if taken advantage of in apt time.”</p>

In the first place, Oscar Barnett admitted his connection with this prosecution. He is a practicing attorney, and in that capacity consulted with his father and advised him that the parties were guilty of perjury. .He admits doing this. Moreover, it was competent, aside from Oscar Barnett’s admissions as a witness on the stand, to show his attitude and relation to this lawsuit and its management as circumstances from which the jury might <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>determine what, if anything, he had to do with the publication of the alleged libelous article. 12 R.

Horatio Barnett was asked if Oscar Barnett knew of this article or had ratified it, and he answered, “No; it produced a little friction between us.

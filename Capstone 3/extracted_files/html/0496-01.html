But, this is not the first time we have considered the validity of a waiver of public trial rights. We should acknowledge what we have said. Recently, in <em>State v. Frawley, </em>a majority of this court held that in a criminal trial, the defendant must <em>personally </em>make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the public trial right. <a href="/wash-2d/181/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="181 Wash. 2d 452" data-case-ids="4356388" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/181/0452-01">181 Wn.2d 452</a>, 461-63, <a href="/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%201022" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="334 P.3d 1022">334 P.3d 1022</a> (2014) (Johnson, J., lead opinion); <em>id. </em>at 467-69 (Stephens, J., concurring), 471-76 (Gordon McCloud, J., concurring).

Conversely, it is not akin to those decisions that may be waived by counsel as a matter of trial tactics or strategy. <em>See <a href="/us/543/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="543 U.S. 175" data-case-ids="3427198" data-case-paths="/us/543/0175-01">id.</a> </em>at 500-01 (citing <em>State v.

    <p id="b544-5" data-blocks='[["BL_544.5",544,[201,1478,1253,751]]]'>¶12 So, why is this statement—made at a proceeding N.P. did not attend—sufficient to constitute a valid waiver in the civil context? The majority does not say. It instead analogizes the public trial right itself, albeit in the civil context, to rights we have said are different from the public trial right in the criminal context. <em>See </em>majority at 500. This is confusing at best. At worst, it suggests we regard open public trials in the civil context as nothing more than a matter of trial strategy. While I agree that N.P. validly waived his right to object to the closure, I would recognize that it is not the public trial right that is different, or of lesser moment, in the civil context. Rather, the standard for determining the validity of a waiver differs between civil and criminal cases.</p>

Thus, a civil litigant may waive very substantial rights, such as the right to a jury trial or the right to complain of a biased juror, based on the terms of a valid statute or court rule. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>State v.

      <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>¶15 Without appreciating this specific context, readers of the majority opinion might get the wrong impression. The right to an open, public trial is not of lesser moment in the civil context. Indeed, we have recognized article I, section 10 “is not an abstract theory of constitutional law, but rather is the bedrock foundation upon which rest all the people’s rights and obligations.” <em>John Doe v. Puget Sound Blood </em>Ctr., <a href="/wash-2d/117/0772-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="117 Wash. 2d 772" data-case-ids="1373938" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/117/0772-01">117 Wn.2d 772</a>, 780, <a href="/citations/?q=819%20P.2d%20370" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="819 P.2d 370">819 P.2d 370</a> (1991). A civil litigant, no less than a criminal defendant, has an “ ‘individual right to have the proceedings open to the observation and scrutiny of the general public.’ ” <em>In re Det. of Morgan, </em><a href="/wash-2d/180/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="180 Wash. 2d 312" data-case-ids="4242119" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/180/0312-01">180 Wn.2d 312</a>, 325, <a href="/citations/?q=330%20P.3d%20774" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="330 P.3d 774">330 P.3d 774</a> (2014) (quoting <em>In re Det. of D.F.F., </em><a href="/wash-2d/172/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="172 Wash. 2d 37" data-case-ids="4018239" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/172/0037-01">172 Wn.2d 37</a>, 40, <a href="/citations/?q=256%20P.3d%20357" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="256 P.3d 357">256 P.3d 357</a> (2011) (plurality opinion)). This right is not simply a matter of trial strategy, left to counsel’s discretion. To the contrary, where open, public trials are concerned, the analysis we employ recognizes courts have an independent obligation to safeguard our system of justice and are not bound by the litigants’ preferences. <em>See Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, </em><a href="/wash-2d/97/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="97 Wash. 2d 30" data-case-ids="1154995" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/97/0030-01">97 Wn.2d 30</a>, 37-39, <a href="/citations/?q=640%20P.2d%20716" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="640 P.2d 716">640 P.2d 716</a> (1982).</p>
    <p id="b546-5" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[197,1439,1257,583]]]'>¶16 We have never before said whether statutes and court rules addressing the particular circumstances of special proceedings may establish the moment at which a civil litigant is required to speak up or be precluded from later claiming a public trial right violation. I believe they, just as other substantial rights, including the right to a civil jury trial, may be waived by inaction in the face of such statutes or rules. In this context, N.P.’s counsel’s representation that N.P had no objection to closure effected a valid waiver of his article I, section 10 rights. On this basis, I concur in the judgment of the court.</p>

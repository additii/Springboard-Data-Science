Appellant interposed three defenses to the proceeding, as follows; First, that the petitioners did not publish the notice as required by § 5230 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest; second, that the petitioners did not give the bond with security required by law; and third, that railroad yards cannot be condemned for a public highway.</p>

The proposed crossing is 912 feet north of the most northerly switch and at a point where the railroad has only one track and where the right-of-way begins to narrow in width. It is the purpose of appellant to use its land at the proposed point of highway and railroad right-of-way intersection for terminal and switching purposes in the natural expansion and development of its business. The right-of-way purchased for yard purposes is about 800 feet wide, whereas the customary width of rights-of-way is 100 feet. Appellant also introduced testimony to the effect that, when the switching tracks should be laid on the north end of the yard, it would be dangerous to have a highway through it on account of cars moving back and forth. The proposed road will connect county road No. 2, mail route, west of the railroad track, with the Jefferson Highway running parallel with the railroad on the east side thereof, and being the main highway between DeQueen and Mena. The proposed road is about two miles long, and will furnish the people in its vicinity and the neighborhood west <a id="p902" href="#p902" data-label="902" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*902</a>of the road an outlet to the Jefferson Highway without being compelled to go around by DeQueen, two miles south, or about two miles north to a cross-road: The petition for the proposed road was filed in the office of the county clerk on the 30th day of January, 1922. Notice of the application was published March 31, 1922. Proof of the application of the notice was filed April 3, 1922. The bond required by the statute was approved April 4, 1922. The viewers for the proposed road were appointed April 6, 1922, and filed their report on July 3, 1922, the day the order was made establishing the highway.</p>
    <p id="b918-3" data-blocks='[["BL_918.4",918,[298,1000,1204,1390]]]'>. Appellant’s first contention for á reversal of .the order or judgment establishing the road is because the petition was presented before notice was given that the application would be made for the road. Section. 5230 of ..Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest requires that notice must be given by publication of the intended application for the road previous to the presentation of the petition for same, and that the notice shall be duly authenticated -and presented with the petition to the county court. We think the statute means that, before the petition shall be called to the attention of the court for action, a required notice shall have been published and duly authenticated. It did no.t mean that the notice should be necessarily published and authenticated before the petition could be filed in the clerk’s office. The record reflects that the petition was filed several months before it was acted upon by the court, but the court-did not act upon it until after the notice had been properly authenticated and filed. The petition was directed to the court and not the clerk. Of course, the court did not- acquire júrisdiction until the notice had been given, authenticated, and filed, because it was a necessary prerequisite and the basis of any action on the part of the court, but it would be technical indeed to interpret the statute as meaning that the notice could not follow the .filing of the petition when the statute provides, in so many words, that the notice shall be duly authenticated and presented with the petition to the county court.</p>

      <a id="p903" href="#p903" data-label="903" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*903</a>Appellant’s second contention for a reversal of the order or judgment is that the court approved a bond without security and appointed the viewers on April- 2, 1922, before the notice had been published-f or a full week. The objection made to the bond is that it was'not -signed by a surety. It was signed by two of the petitioners,-presumably solvent, and was approved by the court. We do not think appellant is in any position to complain of this, since the bond was given to protect the county for costs and expenses incident-to the view in case the-prayer of the petitioners should not be granted or in case the proceedings should not be finally confirmed and established. Section 5228 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest. Objection was also made because the bond was filed- and the viewers appointed before the notice had been published for a full week. These were mere irregularities in the exercise of jurisdiction, and not necessarily prerequisites to the exercise thereof by the court. <em>Polk </em>v. <em>Road Improvement District No. 2 of Lincoln County, </em><a href="/ark/123/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="123 Ark. 334" data-case-ids="1556242" data-case-paths="/ark/123/0334-01">123 Ark. 334</a>.</p>

The argument is that highways opened across railroad yards entail great hazard and danger upon users of the roads and much inconvenience to the railroads themselves. The same, might be said concerning the extension of streets through railroad rights-of-way in cities and towns, yet it is a common thing and acknowledged right to do so. <em>St. L. S. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Fayetteville, </em><a href="/citations/?q=75%20Ark.%20535" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="75 Ark. 535">75 Ark. 535</a>. It is common knowledge that streets run through railroad yards where there are many switches and tracks, and that the "extraordinary hazard and danger to the traveling public is guarded against by flagmen. We can see no reason why railroad and public cannot <a id="p904" href="#p904" data-label="904" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*904</a>o.ccupy the land for their respective purposes, as the uses may reasonably coexist. In this State county courts have exclusive jurisdiction in the matter relating to county roads. Article 7, § 28, Constitution of 1874. It is provided by § 5226 of Crawford &amp; Moses ’ Digest that:</p>
    <p id="b920-3" data-blocks='[["BL_920.4",920,[312,662,1201,1275]]]'>“All public roads and highways shall be laid out, opened and repaired agreeably to the provisions of this act, and the county court of each county shall have full power to make and enforce all orders necessary as well for establishing and opening new roads as for changing and vacating any public road or part thereof.” When a railroad acquires or condemns property for railroad purposes, it takes it with full knowledge that its easement is subject to the establishment of intersecting highways or crossroads wherever necessary for the convenience of the public, and the existing necessity therefor is within the sound discretion of the county court so far as rural highways are concerned. It is suggested by appellant that this rule would allow county courts to lay off highways through depot buildings and other like expensive improvements of railroad companies. Not so, for this could ibe avoided by slight detours, and it would be an abuse of discretion not to make a detour under such circumstances. And likewise it would be an abuse of discretion to unnecessarily cross railroad yards with highways when it could be avoided by a slight deviation in the route of the road, or when it would be practical to construct an overhead or underground way. The whole matter is one of sound discretion by the county court, and subject to review.</p>

The county surveyor testified concerning this, in effect, that the appellants had indicated the yard limits hy a sign painted on a post, which post was a considerable distance north of the proposed road; that the sign, “yard limits,” had been at the same place north of the proposed highway for fifteen or twenty years; that the proposed road was nine hundred and twelve feet north of the last switch at the north end of the yards of appellant. The testimony of witnesses of the appellant, its superintendent, trainmaster, civil engineer of the DeQueen &amp; Eastern and the Texas, Oklahoma &amp; Eastern, was to the effect that the land condemned for the proposed highway was acquired several years ago by appellant for yard purposes; that “it is necessary that this land be held by the railway company for future expansion and use as yards;” that “it would be dangerous to permit, or to have a highway running through the yards,” both to the traveling public and. the railroad. The assistant engineer of appellant, in answer to a question, stated that he did not know of any proposed changes in the yards of appellant at this time. The appellant’s superintendent, on cross-examination, referring to a map of the situation of appellant’s road' at DeQueen, testified that appellant had twenty-five hundred feet south of the proposed crossing upon which appellant could build tracks if it desired. Appellant had not thought about extending the yards .for the past ten years; it had' not been necessary. This witness exhibited a drawing showing the tracks that are now in actual use, and those that would be necessary when the tracks would have to- be expanded and extended. He was asked how far in the future that would be, and answered, “That depends on the traffic of the country.” He was further asked the following question: “I wish to get some idea from you about how long it will be before that will take place, and whether or not there is any immediate danger of that taking place,” and answered, “There is no immediate danger. ’ ’ He further stated that, in his opinion, i| is neces<a id="p906" href="#p906" data-label="906" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*906</a>sary now for the better operation of the road and transportation of freight, bnt the superior officers of the railway company, while agreeing to the idea, were, not quite ready for it.

    <p id="b922-3" data-blocks='[["BL_922.4",922,[302,762,1206,961]]]'>It occurs to us that the above testimony was legally sufficient .to sustain the finding and judgment of the county court and of the circuit court “that the county of Sevier had the right to condemn a highway over the property of the defendants,” because, according to the undisputed testimony, the appellants were not using the land condemned for the highway as yards, and the above testimony was sufficient to warrant a finding by the court that it was uncertain when, if ever, the land condemned would be actually used by appellants as railroad yards. While the lands were acquired many years previous for yard purposes, appellants had not used the,land condemned for railroad yards, and whether they would so use them was, under the evidence, a possibility and probability which the future exigencies of railroad traffic would determine. Appellants • could not purchase land and appropriate it for yard purposes by merely designating.same as “yards.” Bottomed upon such facts we concur in the judgment.</p>

The exclusive jurisdiction vested in county courts “in the matter of public roads” by our Constitution, article 7, § 28, does not confer upon county courts the power to condemn railroad yards that are in actual use as siich for the purposes of public highways.

Such authority is not included, ¿s we have stated, under the general power vested in the county court to establish public roads. The question is one of very great" importance, and, in various, pilases, depending upon the 'facts in the particular case, the question of the right to exercise the power of eminent domain over land that, under such power, has already been devoted to the use of the public, has been before many courts of last resort in this country. It is unnecessary to review them all.

To authorize such an invasion of the rights of the company, there must be an express grant of power by the Legislature, or an implication equally conclusive.

Section 8483, C. &amp; M.

It'may be said-that the language of §'8483 is sufficient to give express author-ity to counties and cities and towns to condemn land for highways or streets across railroad tracks.,Even if such power were not expressly conferred by.the statute upon these governmental agencies, they would have such power under their general powers delegated to them to lay off, open, and establish highways or streets. But the right to condemn land for a public.highway or street over the railroad <em>track or tracks </em>is one thing, while the right to condemn: over railroad <em>yards </em>is an entirely, different thing. All the authorities, as shown above, hold that the right to condemn for public highways or streets over land appropriated by railroads and used for station grounds and yards is not conferred, and cannot be implied, from’the general powers above mentioned. There is a broad dis<a id="p911" href="#p911" data-label="911" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*911</a>tinction between land used by railroad companies for depot grounds and yards and that used' for tracks over which their trains run on schedule. All the authorities recognize the fact that the use of land for grounds and yards is entirely inconsistent with the use over same for highways or streets. The danger and inconvenience in the use of highways or streets over grounds and yards is so great, so imminent, both to the railroad and the pub: lie, that such use is prohibited unless there is. express, or'implied authority therefor. Whereas such use over railroad tracks is.not inconsistent .with.their use also for highways over same. In addition to the authorities already cited, see <em>Cincinnati W. &amp; M. Ry.

The exercise of such power, unauthorized by the Legislature, even though the Supreme 'Court should determine, on review, that the county court had abused its discretion, would nevertheless subject the railway companies to the annoyance and expense of defending in order to protect their rights in property which had already been appropriated by them for a public use. This of itself would be a manifest injustice. The question of the right of a county to condemp lands for a public highway over railroad yards is one of first impression in our State, and, because of its far-reaching significance, we have concluded to express our views of the law. For the reasons stated it occurs to us that, while the judgment, on the facts, is correct, the opinion of the majority, as to the law, is erroneous. We therefore concur in the judgment but earnestly dissent from the opinion.</p>

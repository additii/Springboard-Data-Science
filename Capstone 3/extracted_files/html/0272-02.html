This case, though a collateral proceeding, is, therefore, clearly within the rule established in <em>State Bank v. </em>Conway, <a href="/ark/13/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Ark. 344" data-case-ids="8728154" data-case-paths="/ark/13/0344-01">13 <em>Ark., </em>344</a>, and approved and followed in quite a number of decisions since; but we have thought it proper to direct our attention to so much of the answer as sets up a vendor’s lien as a defense.</p>

    <p id="b298-5" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[268,1384,1212,546]]]'>But this lien is the mere creature of a court of equity, growing out of the sale and non-payment of the purchase money, predicated upon the principle that one who has gotten the estate of another ought not, in conscience, to be allowed to keep it and not pay the consideration money. “It is not, strictly speaking,” says Judge Story, “either a <em>jus in re </em>ora <em>jus in </em>rare, that is, it is not property in the thing itself, nor does it constitute a right of action for the thing. It more properly constitutes a charge-upon the thing.” 2 <em>Sto. Eq. Jur., sec. </em>1215; 1 <em>Hil. on Mort., </em>626.</p>

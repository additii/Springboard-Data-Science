The statute contains the following provision with reference to the compensation of the commissioners, in section 4: “Each of the commissioners shall receive a compensation of $5 per day for each day devoted to the work;” Now, the majority of the judges are of the opinion that this refers solely to duties and attendance upon board meetings, for the commissioners have no individual authority under the statute, and only act in that capacity while in attendance upon the board. In the discharge of duties as members of committees, or personally and individually in acting for the board in inspecting work or assisting in carrying on the work, they exercise only such authority as is delegated to them by the board as a whole, and, when acting in those capacities, they are o'nlv employed as servants of the board of commissioners, therefore they are not entitled to compensation under the statute. If they are entitled to any compensation at all for services performed otherwise than at board meetings,- it must result frpm a valid contract made between the commissioners individually and the board as a whole, and, under the principles announced by this court in several eases, the commissioners are prohibited from entering into contracts for their own benefit for the payment to themselves of compensation. <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>They can only pay such compensation as is expressly ah lowed to them by law. <em>Tallman </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em><a href="/ark/124/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="124 Ark. 6" data-case-ids="1554972" data-case-paths="/ark/124/0006-01">124 Ark. 6</a>; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Cruce, </em><a href="/ark/146/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="146 Ark. 61" data-case-ids="1584974" data-case-paths="/ark/146/0061-01">146 Ark. 61</a>; <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Toland, </em><a href="/ark/149/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="149 Ark. 476" data-case-ids="8720804" data-case-paths="/ark/149/0476-01">149 Ark. 476</a>.

The concluding provision in section 13 is only intended to prevent the allowance of a commission merely upon the deposit of the funds, but this does not affect the right of the treasurer, under the other part of the statute, to receive a commission: on the funds actually paid out on warrants. The statute contemplates that the treasurer should perform substantial service in receiving the moneys and paying the same over to the depository, and the warrants were drawn <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>on him and not on the depository.

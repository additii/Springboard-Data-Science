The returns, as certified by the county democratic central committee, showed that appellant was defeated by a majority of 249 votes, and within ten days thereafter a complaint was filed by appellant contesting this certification.</p>

Later, and more than ten' days after appellee had been certified as the nominee, an amendment was filed to the complaint. A motion was filed and sustained to strike the amended complaint from the record for the following reasons: (1) That the amended complaint alleged new and different grounds for contest, and was not filed within ten days of the date of the certification of the nomination; (2) that the amendment was not supported by the affidavit of ten reputable citizens of Washington County; and (3) that the amendment seeks to change and enlarge the grounds of contest set forth in the original complaint.</p>

We do not, however, concur in this view, for the reason that, in our opinion, no triable issue was left after the demurrer had been sustained to certain of its paragraphs. The portion of the complaint, left after the demurrer to certain of its paragraphs had been sustained, was itself demurrable, as failing to sufficiently state a cause of contest. The vital parts of the complaint were deleted when the demurrer was sustained, and, in our opinion, the demurrer, if sustained at all, should have been sustained to the complaint in its entirety, and that there was not left thereafter a triable cause of action. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Williams, </em><a href="/ark/165/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="165 Ark. 421" data-case-ids="1379865" data-case-paths="/ark/165/0421-01">165 Ark. 421</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=264%20S.W.%20964" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="264 S.W. 964">264 S.

And, further, that persons had voted in the election who had no poll-tax receipts, as had others who were not otherwise qualified, although they held poll-tax receipts, among the latter class being many Republicans. That illegal absentee ballots had been received and counted for appellee, as had also the ballots of certain other persons who had not voted at all, and that certain ballots had been changed from appellant to appellee, and “that, by reason of the illegal and unlawful acts claimed, as aforesaid, the plaintiff had been cheated out of more than fifteen hundred votes in said county, and if the legal votes cast for him had been counted and the illegal votes that had been cast for the defendant were thrown out, this plaintiff would have received the nomination for the office of State Senator by a large majority.”</p>

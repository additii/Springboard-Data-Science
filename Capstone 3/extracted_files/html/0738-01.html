The conditions sought to be alleviated should be considered as a part of the enactment itself. At the time of the enactment, Arkansas was in the midst of the worst depression any member of this court has ever experienced. Thousands of home owners in the State were'without employment, and the bare necessities of life, because thereof, were denied them and their families. All real property in this State was without market value, the net result being that in many instances a five or ten thousand dollar home was sacrificed at public sale for from ten per cent, to twenty-five per cent, of its intrinsic value. The charitable spirit of the members of the Legislature must be commended by all, as the gravity of the question considered by them cannot be gainsaid or denied.</p>

If not paid within that time, the collector was required to add a penalty of 20 per cent, to the delinquents and immediately make a return of delinquents to the board of improvement.

Act 278 changes all this in the following particulars: Instead of thirty days for collection by the collector, the time is extended to 90 days at the expiration of which time 3 per cent, penalty is added instead of 20 per cent., and, instead of making an immediate return of delinquents, the collector is required to wait 90 days more to make such return. Section 1, act 278. Instead of five days’ personal service in which to appear and answer, before default, the time is extended, to six months. If no answer, default may be had at that time.

It must be admitted as a fundamental right of both the district and its bondholders to pay and have paid the obligations of the district at the time and in the manner provided in the contract between them. This can only be accomplished by prompt collection of taxes on assessed benefits which were so fixed and bond maturities so arranged that the annual collections would meet the bond interest and maturities. Under the new act, No. 278, unless all the property owners, or substantially all, voluntarily pay their improvement taxes, bonds and coupons will necessarily become delinquent, as they are not required to pay for a period of two and one-half years before sale, with four years for redemption after sale, and then a penalty of only 3 per cent, (not per annum) is permitted for nonpayment.

Default in payment having ensued, the suit was brought, praying that the mortgaged premises should be sold according to law, without appraisement, that the proceeds arising from the sale should be applied to the payment of the indebtedness due the plaintiff, and that the defendants should be forever barred and precluded of any right of redemption.</p>

Where, in a mortgage, an entire estate is pledged for the payment of a debt, with right to sell the mortgaged premises free from redemption, can that be valid legislation which would seek to substitute a right to sell the premises subject to an estate or right of possession in the debtor or his alienees for eighteen months ? ” * * *</p>

An equitable interest in the premises may, in like manner, be conferred upon others; and the right to redeem may be so prolonged as to deprive the mortgagee of the benefit of his security by rendering the property unsalable for anything like its value. This law gives to the mortgagor and to the judgment creditors (meaning creditors other than the mortgagee) an equitable estate in the premises, which neither of them would have been entitled to under the original contract; and these new interests are directly and materially in conflict with those which the mortg’ag’ee acquired when the mortgage was made.

As I read this case, it has no bearing on this, and is not at all in point. The Minnesota statute, there under consideration, was temporary in character, expiring of its own terms May 1, 1935, and purported to be an emergency measure for a short period of time. There the court was given the power to determine the necessity for the delay and to require the owner to pay a reasonable rental for retaining possession in the event delay was decreed. Here the measure is permanent in character, and it is no answer to say that the Legislature may repeal it when the occasion for its enactment has ceased to exist. And no right to possession or to the rents and profits is accorded during the inore than two years’ delay, in addition to the four years allowed for redemption. The act of 1915, heretofore referred to, did give the right of possession, but <a id="p755" href="#p755" data-label="755" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*755</a>the same Legislature that enacted act 278 of 1933 also repealed the statute giving’ such right by act 29. If, as indicated in the majority opinion, an improvement district may have a receiver appointed for all delinquent property in the district under the authority of chapter 150, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, I think they have dug up a bunch of snakes that will be harder to Mil than the job St. Patrick had in Ireland. That chapter, dealing with the powers of courts of equity to appoint receivers has been the law since January 15, 1857, except §§ 8611 to 8615, inclusive, which are parts of the Civil Code, and up to this time it has never been invoked in a proceeding to collect delinquent taxes in improvement districts. Moreover, it could not be invoked under the provisions of § 8612 relating to mortgaged property, as the court has jurisdiction to appoint a receiver under this section only “where it appears that the mortgaged property is in danger of being lost, removed or materially injured, or that the condition of the mortgage has not been performed, and that the property is probably insufficient to discharge the mortgage debt.” Undoubtedly the Mnd of mortgage referred to is the ordinary mortgage given to secure a personal indebtedness and not a lien upon the benefits assessed against property in an improvement district.</p>

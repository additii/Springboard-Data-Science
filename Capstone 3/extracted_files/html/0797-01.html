F. Thompson was elected and served as president of said district for and during the years 1921, 1922, and 1923, and that-M. C. Hall was elected secretary and served during the years of 1921, 1922 and a part of 1923. That, by virtue of the office as secretary of said district, said Hall acted as secretary of said board, and it was his duty to draw warrants and pay debts on the proper order of said board, to be signed by the president, C. F. Thompson, and M. C. Hall, as secretary. That W. J. Splawn was the regularly elected and duly qualified and acting county treasurer of Chicot County for and during the years 1921, 1922 and 1923, and was custodian -of all the school funds of Chicot County and the Haley-Thompson Special Con<a id="p798" href="#p798" data-label="798" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*798</a>solidated School District, and had and held in his hands funds of the said district which had come to his hands from the various sources of taxes and apportionment and belonging to said district during those years. That, during the years above mentioned, the said M. C. Hall, as secretary of said Haley-Thompson Special Consolidated School District, unlawfully and without warrant or authority illegally drew and signed the name of the president, C. F. Thompson, to a great number of warrants of said district, which warrants were unlawfully cashed and illegally paid by the said W. J. Splawn, county treasurer of said county, without any authority or right on his part to do so. That, by reason of said W. J. Splawn cashing and paying said illegal warrants, the Haley-Thompson Special Consolidated School District has been damaged in the sum of $1,507.17, interest and costs. The warrants are then described in the complaint, giving the number, amount, payee and date of warrants, and plaintiff prays judgment for the amount above mentioned, interest and costs.</p>

The defendant answering, admitted that Thompson was president and Hall was secretary of plaintiff school district, and had duties, power and authority to issue warrants, as alleged in said complaint. Defendant alleged that, as county treasurer, he was advised that it was the practice and custom of Thompson, president of said board, to sign warrants in blank, and in some instances authorizing the signing of his name to warrants by Hall, the then trusted secretary of said school district, and authorizing said secretary to fill in thereafter the amount and purpose for which said warrants were issued,, and that all such-warrants which were presented and paid by this defendant were paid in good faith and without any knowledge of alleged illegality or lack of authority to issue any of such warrants, and that plaintiff should thereby be estopped from any right of action against the defendant. Defendant denied that <a id="p799" href="#p799" data-label="799" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*799</a>plaintiff was damaged in the sum mentioned or any other sum by reason of the issuance and payment of said warrants, but alleged the truth to be that most of said warrants wore issued in payment of salaries earned by teachers under contract with said school district and the remainder thereof on payment of allowances by the board of directors of said school district for necessary incidental expenses of operating schools and expenses of improvements of buildings, etc., and prayed that the complaint be dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b817-3" data-blocks='[["BL_817.4",817,[131,894,1203,663]]]'>Defendant thereafter filed an amendment to his answer, alleging that he presented said warrants for credit and cancellation, as the law requires, to the Chicot County Court, and that said warrants were duly examined, audited, allowed, canceled, and his accounts credited with same. That judgment approving said settlement and allowing him credit for said warrants, as set forth in the complaint, 'by the Chicot County Court, was duly entered. That said judgment still stands as a record of said court; that the plaintiff had its day in court, and that plaintiff has not filed petition to set aside said settlement, nor to reopen same, and has taken no appeal, and pleads the judgment of said county court.</p>

Plaintiff states that it was not before the county court when defendant presented fraudulent warrants and obtained the order giving defendant credit for them, and was not a party to the suit; that the county court had no jurisdiction nor authority to enter an order crediting said Splawn with the amount of said fraudulent warrants; that the warrants were void; that, upon the discovery of the fraud in issuing said warrants, President Thompson, W. T. Knight, director, and other directors of the district took the matter up with the county superintendent, D. T. Henderson, and the defendant, W. J. Splawn, as county treasurer, and that, at a conference between the plaintiff <a id="p800" href="#p800" data-label="800" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*800</a>and defendants, the county superintendent and M. O. Hall, the defaulting- secretary, the amount of the defalcation and fraudulent warrants issued by said Hall as secretary was fixed and arrived at, the said Hall ag-reeing to pay the amount to the said Splawn, county treasurer, and during this proposed settlement and adjustment the defendant, Splawn, appeared in the county court and presented the warrants for cancellation and credit, without the knowledge or consent'of plaintiff or its officers.</p>

That he gave the warrants to Mr. Kirten, attorney for the school district, some time last year; that all the warrants involved in this suit were canceled at various times by the county court and credited to Splawn’s account, and filed certified copies of the judgments. The judgments were dated August 19,1922; February 1,1922; October 1,1921; September 18, 1922. The treasurer’s certified copy of the treasurer’s, settlement was filed October 6, 1925. The clerk further testified that a balance was struck, and he exhibited whatever money he had on hand. Plaintiff ■renewed his motion to exclude the testimony of witness as incompetent, which motion was overruled; the court then stated he thought the plea in abatement which was in the answer was well taken, and that the defendant should <a id="p801" href="#p801" data-label="801" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*801</a>have judgment. Plaintiff filed its motion for new trial, which was overruled, and plaintiff prayed an appeal to the Supreme Court, which was granted.</p>
    <p id="b819-3" data-blocks='[["BL_819.4",819,[120,565,1198,299]]]'>The appellee begins his argument by stating: “The only questions involved upon this appeal, as presented by the record, are: 1. Did the plaintiff’s complaint present a cause of action? 2. Did the circuit court have jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the matter involved upon the record made and presented?”</p>

It is provided by statute: “When the warrant of any board of directors, properly drawn, is presented to the treasurer of the proper county, he shall pay the same out of any funds in his hands for that purpose .belonging to the district specified in said warrant.” Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, § 8925.</p>

When a warrant is therefore presented to the treasurer for payment for an unauthorized purpose, the treasurer pays the same at his peril, and is personally and individually liable to the district for the moneys unlawfully expended.

It. is not a question of his settlements or his accounts, but a question of wrongful conduct resulting in damage to the school district. Certainly there could be no reason to have the county court pass on whether or not a treasurer had wrongfully paid a warrant. As to whether the treasurer did or did not wrongfully pay these warrants or any of them, is a question of fact, and may be determined in a trial in the circuit court without any. regard to what the officer may have done in the county court. It might happen that an officer would make a settlement, and that the school directors or other persons whose money had been converted or misappropriated would know nothing, about the settlement, and might.not learn about it until the two years had expired, but, independent of that, we think there is no reason why the county court should act in a case like this before suit is begun in the circuit court, and that such action by the county court is not necessary to give the. circuit court jurisdiction.</p>

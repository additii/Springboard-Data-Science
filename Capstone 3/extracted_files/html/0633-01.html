Opening Br. of State at 41 (quoting <em>In re Det. of Turay, </em><a href="/wash-2d/139/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="139 Wash. 2d 379" data-case-ids="98987" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/139/0379-01">139 Wn.2d 379</a>, 410, <a href="/citations/?q=986%20P.2d%20790" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="986 P.2d 790">986 P.2d 790</a> (1999)). First, all members of the class— individuals incompetent to stand trial for violent felony charges whom a judge has found committed a violent felony act—are subject to the same uniform procedure under former RCW 71.05.320(3)(c)(ii). Second, the legislature has compelling state interests in distinguishing certain violent mentally ill individuals from other mentally ill people subject to treatment. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>In re Det. of Patterson, </em><a href="/wash-2d/90/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="90 Wash. 2d 144" data-case-ids="1104337" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/90/0144-01">90 Wn.2d 144</a>, 151, <a href="/citations/?q=579%20P.2d%201335" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="579 P.2d 1335">579 P.2d 1335</a> (1978), <em>overruled on other grounds by McLaughlin, </em><a href="/wash-2d/100/0832-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="100 Wash. 2d 832" data-case-ids="1142086" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/100/0832-01">100 Wn.2d 832</a>. Third, the statute is rationally related to those state interests because the distinction is based on “the severity of a person’s criminal behavior” and helps keep those individuals and the public safe while they are at substantial risk of repeating violent acts.

As discussed above in Part B, the government has strong interests in protecting the public from violent acts of individuals and in ensuring proper treatment for mentally ill people. This statute singles out a particular set of individuals—those found incompetent to stand trial for violent felony charges when a judge makes a finding the person committed a violent felony act—and slightly modifies the recommitment process in a way that continues to ensure that the individual will receive an additional 180 days of involuntary treatment when the State proves by a clear, cogent, and convincing standard of proof that the <a id="p666" href="#p666" data-label="666" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*666</a>individual still poses a substantial risk of repeating similar violent acts as a result of his mental illness.

Opening Br. of State of Wash. Dep’t of Health &amp; Human Servs. at 6 (emphasis added).

On the other hand, the State argued that the amendment didn’t change the criteria for civil commitment <em>at all. </em>Opening Br. of State of Wash. Dep’t of Health &amp; Human Servs. at 35-36 (arguing that the amendment creates no risk of erroneous civil commitment because if a person can’t provide an expert opinion to contradict the State’s petition, “then there is minimal likelihood that the [person] would be able to prevail in a full evidentiary hearing”).

As the majority points out, the legislature enacted former RCW 71.05.320(3)(c)(ii) to address “a gap in the statutory system” into which “violent, mentally ill individuals” fall when they are incompetent to stand trial.

If the legislature actually intended to treat people such as the respondents more like insanity acquittees, then it would follow that the legislature intended to make it <em>easier </em>for the State to continue their commitment. In other words, the legislature might well have intended former RCW 71.05-.320(3)(c)(ii) to impose a <em>lower </em>evidentiary burden on the State than the clear, cogent, and convincing standard; to <em>relieve </em>the court of its responsibility to rule on less restrictive alternatives; and/or to <em>omit </em>any guarantee of counsel.</p>

Insanity acquittees may be committed under the lower preponderance standard for reasons that do not apply to individuals, like the respondents, deemed incompetent to stand trial. First, in an insanity acquittal, <em>the acquittee him- or herself </em>advances the argument that mental illness caused the dangerous behavior; second, the acquittee does so <em>while </em>competent; and third, a fact finder has already found, <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>that the <a id="p671" href="#p671" data-label="671" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*671</a>acquittee committed at least one criminal act because of mental illness. <em>Born v.

    <p id="b725-5" data-blocks='[["BL_725.5",725,[200,835,1249,806]]]'>¶77 Procedural due process analysis is flexible by design. In the civil commitment context, it allows the legislature to tailor the procedures governing commitment and periodic review to the needs of specific populations. <em>See Jones, </em><a href="/us/463/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="463 U.S. 354" data-case-ids="6195188" data-case-paths="/us/463/0354-01">463 U.S. at 367-68</a> (insanity acquittees and other civil commitment candidates subject to different standards of proof because “ ‘due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands’ ” (quoting <em>Morrissey v.

Thus, there are a variety of ways in which the legislature could address the issues posed by individuals whose mental illness makes them incompetent to stand trial for acts of violence. The key point here is that the legislature, not this court, has the authority to write the laws that do so.</p>

Like the trial court in this case, I conclude that former RCW 71.05.320(3)(c)(ii) is unconstitutionally vague because it vests virtually unlimited discretion in a reviewing court to determine whether an individual has provided sufficient “proof” to rebut the State’s “prima facie evidence” that civil commitment should continue for another six months without a full evidentiary hearing.

While both offenses involve stealing money or property, theft is elevated to robbery where the defendant uses force or threatened force to take the property. The main question in this case is whether certain conduct constituted a “threat of force,” making the crime a robbery, not a theft. The legislature has broadly defined “threat” to specifically include “indirect [ ]” threats. RCW 9A.04-.110(28). We have established in our case law that a threat need not be explicit to qualify—a threat can be implied by words or conduct. As we recently held, where an ordinary person could reasonably infer a threat of harm from the defendant’s conduct, the defendant made an implied threat of force. <em>State v. Witherspoon, </em><a href="/wash-2d/180/0875-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="180 Wash. 2d 875" data-case-ids="4241986" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/180/0875-01">180 Wn.2d 875</a>, 884, <a href="/citations/?q=329%20P.3d%20888" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="329 P.3d 888">329 P.3d 888</a> (2014). Today, we are asked to decide whether, under the circumstances here, respondent Charles Farnsworth’s handwritten note demanding money from a bank teller contained an implied threat of force.</p>

When a person demands money at a bank, with no explanation or indication of lawful entitlement to <a id="p772" href="#p772" data-label="772" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*772</a>money, it can imply a threat of force because without such a threat, the teller would have no incentive to comply. An ordinary bank teller could reasonably infer an implied threat of harm under these circumstances. Because of this implicit threat, banks have security guards and distinctive policies in place to prevent harm flowing from precisely these types of encounters. As Farnsworth’s partner in crime explained, they were well aware that banks generally instructed their employees to react to such notes as if they contained an explicit threat; in fact, the pair relied on that knowledge and fear to commit this crime. In this context, we hold that there is sufficient evidence that the pair’s conduct implied a threat of harm.</p>

The pair made a plan to “rob” a bank. 13 Report of Proceedings (RP) at 1208. The plan was for McFarland to wait outside in the car while Farnsworth entered a bank, wearing a wig and sunglasses as a disguise, and retrieved money.

He grabbed the wig and note from Farnsworth’s hands and entered the bank to carry out their plan. While Farnsworth waited outside in the car, McFarland approached a teller’s counter, leaned through her window, and <a id="p773" href="#p773" data-label="773" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*773</a>handed her the note. The teller, Sarah Van Zuyt, testified that she instantly knew she was being robbed when she read the note. She said she was “scared” and “in shock.” 9 RP at 484. Ms. Van Zuyt complied with the demand “[ble-cause I didn’t want anybody else to get harmed, and I didn’t know what he was capable of doing.” <em>Id. </em>at 486.

Farnsworth faced the possibility of a life sentence under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA) of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 if convicted of this robbery, as he was previously convicted of a 2004 robbery and a 1984 vehicular homicide in California. Ch. 9.94A RCW. The POAA requires a life sentence when a repeat offender commits a third felony that is classified as a “most serious offense” (often referred to as a “third strike”).

He agreed to a plea bargain for an 8- to 10-year sentence instead of a life sentence, whereby McFarland would testify against Farnsworth in Farns-worth’s jury trial for robbery. McFarland agreed to testify against Farnsworth after Farnsworth acted rudely toward McFarland while staying at Western State Hospital following arrest. 15 RP at 1430-31.</p>

Farnsworth also argued that he was deprived of a fair trial under the cumulative error doctrine, raising six claimed errors.

Specifically, the State asks us to reverse the Court of Appeals’ finding that the use of the demand note here was insufficient to show any implicit or explicit threat of force. For the reasons explained below, we hold that under these circumstances—including the use of a demand note with no claim of legal entitlement to the money, the note’s reference to dye packs, and the defendants’ awareness that banking personnel would treat the note as a threat—there was sufficient evidence of an implied threat of force.</p>

That is because the distinguishing element between robbery and theft is the use or threatened use of force. Robbery is committed when a person unlawfully takes the property of another “by the use or threatened use of immediate force, <a id="p776" href="#p776" data-label="776" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*776</a>violence, or fear of injury to that person . . . RCW 9A-.56.190. Theft, on the other hand, does not require any use of force. It is simply the wrongful taking of the property of another with intent to deprive him or her of such property. RCW 9A.56.020(l)(a).</p>
    <p id="b830-4" data-blocks='[["BL_830.4",830,[202,633,1247,584]]]'>¶18 Washington’s criminal code defines “threat” as “to communicate, directly <em>or indirectly </em>[,] the intent” to take a certain action. RCW 9A.04.110(28) (emphasis added). In many robberies, the threat of force is explicit. For instance, a robber might directly communicate to a teller, “Hand over the money, or I will shoot you.” Other times, the threat is clearly implied by conduct, such as pointing a gun at a bank teller and simply stating, “Give me the money.” At issue in this case is whether, under the circumstances, the demand note given to the teller contained an indirect communication of implied threat of force.</p>
    <p id="b830-5" data-blocks='[["BL_830.5",830,[201,1241,1253,800]]]'>¶19 We recently considered an implied threat in <em>Wither-spoon </em>and articulated an objective standard to determine if the defendant used intimidation to take property: we ask if “an ordinary person in the victim’s position could reasonably infer a threat of bodily harm from the defendant’s acts.” 180 Wn.2d at 884. There, the victim returned home to find an unknown car in her driveway and Witherspoon at the side of her home. <em>Id. </em>at 881.

But some lower Washington courts have found that a demand note presented to a bank contains an implied threat based on the social and historical context of bank robberies.

Under <em>Witherspoon’s </em>objective test, the facts here support a finding that a reasonable person in the teller’s position could reasonably infer a threat of bodily harm. Just as Witherspoon knew that if he told the victim he had a gun she would let him leave with her belongings, Farnsworth and McFarland knew that a bank teller would comply with whatever they wrote in the note if they conveyed a threat. McFarland testified, “[W]henever you’re robbing a bank, bank tellers are supposed to do exactly what you told them. Because they want to get somebody out of there. They figure the danger or potential danger to the place.” 14 RP at 1254. They knew if the note conveyed a serious demand, it would imply a threat of force that would compel compliance.

She said she “knew [she] was getting robbed” instantly upon reading the note and complied to avoid anyone getting hurt. 9 RP at 482, 486. An ordinary person in her position could likewise reasonably infer that McFarland threatened to use force, as McFarland made no attempt to feign lawful entitlement to the money and instead demonstrated an unlawful intent by ordering her not to include dye packs in the money.</p>

In his testimony, McFarland’s use of various terms was not accidental: he distinguished between robbery and “boosting,” which he likened to “shoplifting” or stealing. 13 RP at 1205; 14 RP at 1277. McFarland’s word choice illustrates his intent to commit a robbery in the bank, as opposed to the crime of theft.</p>

This, he argues, would mean that any unlawful demand for money at a bank would constitute robbery. This concern is understandable but ultimately unfounded. In every such case, the circumstances will be unique and context-dependent, causing courts to determine whether the evidence supports an objective finding of a threat under our <em>Witherspoon </em>standard. For instance, a demand that arises out of confusion or mistake might not constitute a threat. Context matters.</p>

For example, a theft would occur where an individual induced the bank teller to place money on the counter and then took it without having any entitlement to it. It would be a theft, not a robbery, because the hypothetical lacks even an implied threat of force. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>United States v. Wagstaff, </em><a href="/f2d/865/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="865 F.2d 626" data-case-ids="10529284" data-case-paths="/f2d/865/0626-01">865 F.2d 626</a>, 627, 629 (4th Cir. 1989) (finding insufficient evidence of robbery because the defendant did not take money “ ‘by intimidation’ ” where he removed money from a cash drawer without communicating with bank personnel). However, as the <em>Collinsworth </em>court observed, where a person demands the bank’s money, “unsupported by even the pretext of any lawful entitlement to the funds,” the demand can contain an implicit threat of force. <em>Collinsworth, </em><a href="/wash-app/90/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="90 Wash.

A demand note for money at a bank can carry with it an implied threat of harm if the teller does not comply.

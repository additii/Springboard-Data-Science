The Democratic County Committee declined to permit the' appellant to comply with the party rules for the purpose of becoming such candidate on the ground that no such office would be in existence to be filled at the general election because of the provisions of said act No. 21, § 1 of which provides:</p>

The Legislature, not being expressly prohibited by the Constitution, is fully authorized to create separate courts of chancery. This necessarily infers the power to provide its complete organization, and there is no constitutional inhibition against providing separate clerks for chancery courts. The clerks of chancery courts are at present the result of legislation and are not constitutional officers. See § 2196, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest. If the Legislature has the power to create the office of chancery clerk under the provisions of the Constitution, it is not unreasonable to conclude that it also - has the power to provide the manner of filling that office, its tenure, and all other necessary provisions to make the organization of the court complete and effective. We therefore conclude that act No. 21 is a general act, not only because it deals exclusively with the functions of a court of Statewide jurisdiction and importance, hut because the Legislature in passing the act in question was exercising a specific grant of power conferred upon it by the Constitution of the State.</p>

It was created by the act of January 15, 1855, as amended by act of January 13, 1857, under the provisions of the Constitution of 1836. The distinctive classification of this court was recognized <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>in the Constitution of 1874 by the provisions of § 44 of article 7. It was recognized by the G-eneral Assembly as a court of special distinction in act No. 106, approved April 1, 1885, which created the first chancery district of the State, § 18 of the act reciting: “That, inasmuch as the State will necessarily have business, and be interested in cases arising within the jurisdiction of the chancery court of Pulaski County, where the seat of government is situated, the said court shall be provided with a court room and clerk’s office, for the accommodation of said chancery court, in the State House building. ’ ’</p>

Inasmuch as the clerk of this court is exclusively a judicial officer, it cannot be said to be inappropriate that he shall be treated differently from the other clerks of the State who are not exclusively judicial officers.

    <p id="b132-9" data-blocks='[["BL_132.12",132,[287,1187,1202,548]]]'>The complaint, as amended, alleged that the prosecuting attorney, when requested, had failed and neglected to join in the action or to bring a separate action. With the complaint was filed a bill of particulars setting out the sums received each month for feeding the county prisoners and the sums received for feeding the federal prisoners. It was alleged that Williams had made no accounting of the expense incurred in the feeding of the prisoners or what the net profits were; that he acted in this matter under color of authority of act No. 81 of the General Assembly of 1931.</p>

    <p id="b133-5" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[156,447,1193,88]]]'>To that complaint a demurrer was interposed and sustained.</p>
    <p id="b133-6" data-blocks='[["BL_133.5",133,[151,565,1209,1309]]]'>It is first insisted that the complaint does not state issuable facts because its allegations are that plaintiff' (appellant) is informed and believes that it cost appellee less than eighty-five cents per day to feed a prisoner, and that he believes appellee has received greatly in excess of the cost of feeding the prisoners. Where the facts are not alleged to exist, but there is a mere statement only that plaintiff has received information to that effect, a complaint is insufficient and is subject to demurrer, but where the charge is made upon information and belief, and there are averments in the complaint warranting the inference that the pleader asserts them to be true, the complaint is sufficient upon demurrer. <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Davies, <a href="/ark/36/0446-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="36 Ark. 446" data-case-ids="1872459" data-case-paths="/ark/36/0446-01">36 </a></em><a href="/ark/36/0446-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="36 Ark. 446" data-case-ids="1872459" data-case-paths="/ark/36/0446-01">Ark. 446</a>; <em>Sebastian County </em>v. <em>Hocott, </em><a href="/ark/141/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="141 Ark. 301" data-case-ids="1592965" data-case-paths="/ark/141/0301-01">141 Ark. 301</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=217%20S.W.%20258" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="217 S.W. 258">217 S.

It is the rule that, if, from the allegations of facts in the complaint together with every reasonable inference arising from all of the allegations, a cause of action is stated, the demurrer should be overruled. This is a suit for an accounting and from all the allegations we are of the opinion that it reasonably appears that the charge is made as a fact that appellee received for feeding the prisoners a sum in excess of the actual cost thereof and in excess of the sum of $10,000. We think therefore that the complaint was not subject to demurrer on the ground first urged. <em>Kilgore Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Halley, </em><a href="/ark/140/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="140 Ark. 448" data-case-ids="1594443" data-case-paths="/ark/140/0448-01">140 Ark. 448</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=215%20S.W.%20653" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="215 S.W. 653">215 S.

The appellee contends that there was no duty on his part to do this because of the provisions of act No. 81 of the General Assembly of 1931; that it was within the power of the Legislature to allow a reasonable lump sum to cover the expense of feeding the prisoners, and that this is what act No. 81 provided.</p>

Further provision was made in that act to the effect that said record books kept by county officers should be kept open for the inspection of the judges of the circuit and county courts of the county, and that each officer coming within the purview of the act should make an annual report under oath beginning at the end of the first year of his term of office, and that the county officers should make this repor-t to the judge of the circuit court in which “shall be set forth the amount of money or other evidence of value, if any, received during* the year preceding on account of such office whether from salary, fees or other emoluments or perquisites of such office,” and, if the total amount of' the receipts of office shall exceed in par funds the sum of $5,000, the officer shall <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>further report the amount expended by him in the conduct of his office for said year which shall be deducted from the gross amount of receipts, and, if the balance shall exceed the sum of $5,000 in the case of a county officer, it shall be paid into the treasury of the county.</p>

    <p id="b135-6" data-blocks='[["BL_135.5",135,[177,907,1206,753]]]'>We approach the question of the constitutionality of the act involved with this principle in mind and with recognition of the legislative power to fix a certain sum as expenses in any reasonable manner where, by so doing the Constitution is not violated. In support of the constitutionality of the act in question, we are referred by counsel to cases of other jurisdictions and to our own case of <em>Mays </em>v. <em>Phillips County, </em><a href="/ark/168/0829-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="168 Ark. 829" data-case-ids="8725586" data-case-paths="/ark/168/0829-01">168 Ark. 829</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=274%20S.W.%205" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="274 S.W. 5">274 S.

We refrain from reviewing the cases cited from other jurisdictions because the question before ns must be determined from a consideration of the peculiar language in our Constitution and laws, and we think that the case of <em>Mays </em>v. <em>Phillips County, supra, </em>has no application, for the reason that the question now before us was not presented to the court in that case.</p>

Therefore the declaration of the Legislature that the expense of feeding prisoners is eighty-five cents per prisoner per day, which should not be considered as fees of the office, is inoperative, if its practical <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>application would serve to increase the salary of the officer beyond the limit fixed by the Constitution.</p>

In the case of <em>Ashton </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em><a href="/ark/164/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="164 Ark. 254" data-case-ids="1382223" data-case-paths="/ark/164/0254-01">164 Ark. 254</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=261%20S.W.%20624" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="261 S.W. 624">261 S. W. 624</a>, this court held that this ivas nothing more nor less than an allowance and was in violation of the Constitution. We can see no difference in principle between the question considered in that case and the one here involved. It is very ably argued that the policy of act No. 81 was wise and expedient, that the amount named as expenses for feeding the county prisoners ivas not unreasonable to the extent that the court would take judicial notice that it was such. The answer is that its effect clearly might be to compensate appellee in a sum greater than that fixed by the Constitution, and, however ivise or reasonable it might be, it is none the less a violation of the plain provisions of the Constitution.</p>

This is not true however for the sums received by him from the Government were received because he was a county officer and by virtue of his office. These sums therefore stood on no different footing from the fees received from any other source because appellee is required to account for all fees and perquisites received, either directly or indirectly.</p>

The Legislature, by act 666 of 1923, § 5, defined a public highway, and the policy limits the meaning public highway as prescribed in it, which in nowise <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>conflicts with the contention that the road, laid out and being improved, was a public highway within the meaning of the statute and our decisions. <em>Finney </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/172/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="172 Ark. 115" data-case-ids="1407816" data-case-paths="/ark/172/0115-01">172 Ark. 115</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=287%20S.W.%20744" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="287 S.W. 744">287 S.

(2) That the commissioners of the district are authorized to refund the outstanding bonds of the district and reissue them in a bond issue to embrace both the outstanding bonds and a new issue floated for obtaining money with which to widen, deepen, straighten or otherwise improve the system of drainage in the district. (3) That act 203 of the Acts of 1927 requires a majority in number, acreage or value of the landowners of the district, and not a majority in number, acreage and value of such landowners, before being- authorized to proceed under that act.</p>

But in the same section provision is made for a hearing before the county court to determine whether the necessary majority has been obtained, and it is provided that “on the day named in said notice, it shall be the duty of the county court to meet and to hear all persons who wish to be heard, and first to determine whether a majority in numbers, acreage <em>or </em>value of the landowners have petitioned for the doing of the work under the revised plans, and, if it-finds that such majority have signed the petition,” the court shall then hear the complaints ag'ainst assessments, 'based upon the revised plans.</p>

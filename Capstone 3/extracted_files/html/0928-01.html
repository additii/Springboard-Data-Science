L. Sneed, left surviving him his widow, Mrs. Grace Sneed, a daughter 17 years of age, a son 20 years of age, and another son 12 years of age, as the next of Idn and heirs at law; that prior to the injury said Sneed was a strong, healthy, able-bodied and industrious man, and was contributing all his earnings, except a small amount necessary for his own maintenance, to the support, care and comfort of his wife and children.</p>
    <p id="b948-3" data-blocks='[["BL_948.4",948,[304,1124,1201,201]]]'>There was a trial by jury, and a verdict and judgment for the appellee, Mrs. Sneed, in the.sum of $3,000, and a verdict and judgment in favor of the estate in the sum of $2,000. The case is here on appeal.</p>
    <p id="b948-4" data-blocks='[["BL_948.5",948,[301,1338,1202,867]]]'>It is earnestly insisted by the appellant that there is no evidence to support the verdict, and no evidence showing negligence on the part of the bus driver. A map, or diagram, was introduced in evidence, and the evidence shows that the collision occurred at a curve. The deceased, Sneed, was traveling from Berryville to Eureka Springs, and, according to the evidence, the accident occurred just after Sneed had entered into the curve. The road at that place curved to Sneed’s right, and Sneed should have been on the right-hand side of the road, next to the mountain or bluff. The bus driver who was going in the opposite direction, if he was on the right side of the road, as he should have been, would have been at the outside part of the curve, and, according to the diagram and evidence, there was ample room for the cars to pass. It was snowing and sleeting; the bus driver was coming downhill, and Sneed was going uphill.</p>

He testified <a id="p931" href="#p931" data-label="931" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*931</a>that he was on his side of the road, and did not start to slow down, hut thought the driver of the other ear would honk as he came around closer. He then applied his brakes and sounded his horn, and Sneed came right on and hit him, and that was on the right side of the road. He testified that the grade was a steep one; that, when he first saw the approaching car, before he got to the second curve, and making the left turn, the other car was at a point designated as “B” on the diagram, which is some distance on the road toward Berryville; that, when he saw the other car coming straight against him, he applied his brakes and sounded his horn. He also testifies that the cars hit, and for the time being there was a stop; then the bus gradually pushed the car diagonally across the road downhill. He said that he approached the place of the accident driving at from 20 to 30 miles an hour. He had hydraulic brakes, and first applied them, and then used his emergency brakes. It caused the bus to skid some, and cut the speed, and at the moment of impact he said he was going about 10 miles an hour. The hydraulic brakes applied to all four wheels, and would not cause a skid. The bus had dual or double wheels in the rear. Witness said that coming down the grade on his left or the north side of the road was a mountainside, and on his right a sharp drop. He then describes the damage to the cars, and says that the bus pushed the other car down the road to the embankment. This witness testified that he left Eureka Springs driving at 20 to 30 miles an hour; that he did not have a schedule under which he drove 50 to GO miles an hour, but the buses are governed at 40 miles an hour. Witness supposed the bus weighs about 7,000 pounds, and he was going 25 or 30 miles an hour. The natural tendency of the bus was to lean toward the bank. When he first saw the Ford coming, he did not slow up because he thought it was going to turn away, but as he came nearer he applied his brakes. Witness was asked the <em>question: “If </em>you had applied your brakes you could have avoided the collision at that time?” and he answered, “I could have stopped, maybe: I don’t know. ’’ He testified that it was easier to <a id="p932" href="#p932" data-label="932" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*932</a>stop a car with hydraulic four-wheel brakes than where it had only two brakes.</p>
    <p id="b950-3" data-blocks='[["BL_950.4",950,[296,454,1205,816]]]'>Witness Denny testified that he paid little attention to the size of the bus, but that it was eight or ten times larger than the Ford, and would weigh six or seven times as much. Witness found the car against the bank, and thought the collision occurred about 50 feet diagonally up the road from where the car was; saw glass about two or two and a half feet on the north or right-hand center of the road going toward Eureka Springs. This witness also said, from where the glass was, the big car came kind of diagonally off until it took the little car against the bank. Witness traced the tracks to the middle of the road. The hind wheels were two feet south of the middle, and the front wheels were two feet north of the middle. Witness said the bus coming down the grade at 25 or 30 miles an hour could have been stopped in 75 feet. He testified that the Ford would weigh about 2,300.</p>
    <p id="b950-4" data-blocks='[["BL_950.5",950,[298,1284,1201,194]]]'>Other witnesses testified about the condition at the place of the accident, and about the tracks of the bus coming diagonally across from the right side to the left side of the road.</p>
    <p id="b950-5" data-blocks='[["BL_950.6",950,[297,1500,1207,393]]]'>All of the evidence shows that, when the cars had stopped, the Ford car was against the bluff. This bluff was on the right side of the road, the way Sneed was going. Several of the witnesses testified that the bus' went diagonally across the road from the driver’s right to the left side, and pushed the Ford against the bluff. The evidence shows that it was snowing and sleeting, and the road was slick.</p>
    <p id="b950-6" data-blocks='[["BL_950.7",950,[298,1917,1203,507]],["BL_951.1",951,[186,336,1204,512]]]'>There was considerable evidence in addition to what we have set out tending to show the condition of the road, the situation of the cars after the collision, and the tracks made by the bus. We think, however, that, from the evidence’ above set out the jury could have found that the driver of the bus was going down grade on a slippery road at the rate of speed of 30 or 35 miles an hour; that he was not on the right side of the road, and that he made no effort to stop immediately upon discovering Sneed coming from the other direction. In other <a id="p933" href="#p933" data-label="933" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*933</a>words, we think the evidence as to the negligence of the bus driver was sufficient to submit this question to the jury, and the jury’s finding on conflicting evidence is conclusive here, although we might think it was against the preponderance of the evidence. It would serve no useful purpose to set out the evidence in detail, for the reason that the finding of the jury on conflicting evidence is conclusive here. The burden of proof was, of course, upon the appellee to show that appellant was guilty of negligence.</p>
    <p id="b951-3" data-blocks='[["BL_951.4",951,[185,868,1208,915]]]'>Appellant contends that the court erred in asking witness Denny the following question, and permitting him to answer it. “Assuming that the bus has an emergency brake, and from the size of the car you observed and the direction you gave the jury, and it weighing 6 or 7 times as much as the small car, and the character of the road you observed, state -whether or not, if that car had been running at a reasonable rate, 20 to 30 miles an hour, down hill, that it could have been stopped within a reasonable distance with the application of the emergency brake.” The witness answered: “Within a distance of 75 feet.” The evidence shows that Denny is a mechanic in a Ford garage at ¿Berryville, and has operated cars 20 or 25 years. We do not think there was any error in permitting the question and answer. He certainly qualified himself to testify about emergency brakes and hydraulic brakes, and the effect that their application would have on a car.</p>
    <p id="b951-4" data-blocks='[["BL_951.5",951,[186,1811,1207,611]],["BL_952.1",952,[303,339,1202,192]]]'>Appellant, in this connection, calls attention to the case of <em>Malvern &amp; O. R. Rd.

In that case it was urged that the court committed error in permitting witnesses to express an opinion as to what the damages were without stating the facts upon which the opinion was based, and the court said: “We think no error was committed in permitting the witnesses to express their opinion where it was shown that they had some knowledge of the facts about which they testified.” The court also said in this connection: “Whether a -witness has such knowledge of the facts as to make his opinion of any value is a question largely <a id="p934" href="#p934" data-label="934" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*934</a>within the discretion of the trial judge, and the value of such testimony may be tested by cross-examination of the witnesses as to the facts upon which the opinion is based. ” .</p>
    <p id="b952-3" data-blocks='[["BL_952.4",952,[302,550,1201,342]]]'>In the instant case the witness testified about his experience and qualification, and especially with reference to the effect of emergency and hydraulic brakes, and, even if he had never seen them tested on a large bus, still he could give his opinion as to what the effect would be, if he had experience in the use of such brakes on other cars.</p>

Sneed asked him whose fault it was, and witness said: “They all say it was your fault; you were on the wrong side of the road.” He testified that Sneed made no reply. This testimony, appellant insists, was a part of the <em>res gestae. </em>Sneed’s question may have been, but certainly the state<a id="p935" href="#p935" data-label="935" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*935</a>ment of the witness was no part of the <em>res </em>gestae, and was inadmissible.

Instruction No. 7 authorized the jury to find for the plaintiff if the defendant negligently, operated the bus, and by reason of said carelessness and negligence, struck the Ford car driven by Sneed and fatally injured Sneed. This instruction also told the jury: “If you fail to so find, you should find for the defendant.”</p>

The court modified said instruction by striking out “partly.” It then read, “if the collision that occurred was due solely to the fault of Sneed.” The instruction as requested should have been given, but, for the fact that the jury had already been told in the instruction immediately preceding this that, if Sneed was guilty of negligence which caused or contributed to the injury, plaintiff could not recover.

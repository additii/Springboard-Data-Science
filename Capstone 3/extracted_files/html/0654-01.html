Thereafter the present amendment was adopted, and, in submitting the present amendment to be voted upon, the provision for the Initiative and Bef eren-dum Amendment as to counties was in a separate paragraph, in which the amendment was not mentioned. It simply provided for local, special and municipal legislation of every character in and for their respective municipalities and counties. The fact that the people adopted this provision a second time, and having written it in such plain language that it cannot be misunderstood by any one, shows clearly that they intended to reserve to themselves the right to pass all local laws affecting <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>the counties. In addition to this, in 1926 the people initiated and adopted an amendment to the Constitution which reads as follows:</p>
    <p id="b677-5" data-blocks='[["BL_677.5",677,[210,534,1197,147]]]'>“The General Assembly shall not pass any local or special act. This amendment shall not prohibit the repeal of local or special acts.”</p>
    <p id="b677-6" data-blocks='[["BL_677.6",677,[209,685,1199,251]]]'>It is therefore seen, not only that the people reserve to themselves the power to legislate as to the local affairs of the county, hut they adopted an amendment expressly prohibiting the Legislature from passing any local or special law.</p>
    <p id="b677-7" data-blocks='[["BL_677.7",677,[211,941,1201,290]]]'>The appellant, however, contends that the measure adopted by the people of Union County is contrary to the general law of the State, and therefore violative of the constitutional amendment which prohibits counties from enacting local legislation contrary to any general law of the State.</p>

That, however, is not a general law fixing the fees of the county officers of the State, but that law provides that the Legislature has determined and declared that the fees now being drawn by the different county officers, according to the provisions of general statutes of the State, and special and local acts, are based on proper classification, and that they shall continue to receive the salaries and fees under said local and special acts. Therefore the act itself provides that they are still receiving the fees and salaries under special acts, and not under general acts. We do not think the people had in mind legislation of this character in adopting the amendment which provided that no local law shall be enacted contrary to a general law.</p>

The fixing of salaries <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>and compensations to be paid county officers is of peculiar interest to the taxpayers of the county, and it was legislation of this kind that the people intended to provide for.

It is undisputed that Sadie Davison was in no way related to the insured, nor did she have an insurable interest in her life as the court told the jury. It is likewise undisputed that the insured, Lucy Mitchell, was suffering from heart disease and dropsy and not in sound health on the day of the application, nor on the date of the-issuance of the policy, and that the policy was never delivered to Lucy Mitchell.</p>

An insurance' company may limit its liability to recovery of premiums paid if an insured was not in sound health on the date of the policy, and a condition that the policy shall not take effect unless delivered during the lifetime and good health of the insured is a valid condition precedent to the liability of the company. 37 C.

We do not agree with counsel in this contention. According to the allegations of the complaint in each case, the defendant concealed from the plaintiff the withholding of certain part of the earnings of the partnership for the three years set out in the complaint. It is alleged that the plaintiff had no voice in the management of the business, and did not actively assist in carrying it on. On the contrary, it is alleged that the defendant Lake was the actual manager of the business, and fraudulently concealed from the plaintiff that he had failed to pay him a part of his earnings for the three years specified in the complaint and that he had converted same to his own use. It is further alleged that notice of the fraud was not acquired by the plaintiff until October 1, 1926. The original complaint was filed on the 8th day of April, 1927, and summons was served on the defendant on the 9th day of April, 1927. The amendment to the complaint was filed on May 26, 1928. Therefore the cause of action is not barred by the statute- of limitations. It is well settled in this ‘State that, where there has been a fraudulent concealment of the cause of action, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered.

In the instant case the partnership had been dissolved, and the plaintiff in each case had sold out his interest to the defendant Lake. The wrong complained of does not involve a readjustment of the partnership business or accounts. The contract of dissolution stands, and the partnership relation no longer exists. The ground of action is in no way connected with the state of the partnership business, except that the defendant is alleged to have withheld from the plaintiff a part of the profits for three different years and to have converted the same to his own use. A certain specified and definite amount is alleged to have been withheld by the defendant for three different years, and to have been fraudulently converted to his own use. The alleged fraud and deceit is not asked to be a ground for setting aside the settlement between the partners or for reforming the accounts. The rig'ht of the action in this case is the alleged tort of Lake in fraudulently withholding from the plaintiff in each case a certain part of the profits of the partnership for three different years, and converting the same to his own use. The former partnership between the parties is in no way concerned, and there is nothing in the former partnership relation which prevents the maintenance of this action for the alleged deceit. <em>Crockett </em>v. <em>Burleson </em>

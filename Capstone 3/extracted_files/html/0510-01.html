The Commission conducts hearings where it has the authority to “administer oaths, issue subpoenas, receive evidence, compel the production of documents for such purposes, and ... question witnesses.” SMC 4.04.250(L)(3). Employees have the “right to cross-examine witnesses and to produce relevant evidence at hearings.” SMC 4.04.260(G). The Commission has authority to issue remedial orders including reinstatement, SMC 4.04.250(L)(5), and must issue its decision within 90 days after a hearing, SMC 4.04.260(H).

She hired counsel to represent her.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Commission consolidated her case with another employee’s and assigned the case to a hearing examiner. The hearing lasted eight days and included written discovery and depositions, significant briefing, witness testimony and cross-examination, thousands of pages of exhibits and record, evidentiary rulings, and an audio recording of the proceedings. The hearing examiner issued a 25-page decision that analyzed the two employees’ discipline in detail and compared it to that of other employees. The hearing examiner concluded that their discipline was too harsh and, therefore, reversed Arnold’s demotion and reduced her discipline to a two week suspension. The decision ordered Arnold’s employer to reinstate her to her former manager position and awarded back pay and other employee benefits.</p>

The City seizes on this distinction and relies on Court of Appeals cases that deny attorney fee awards under RCW 49.48.030 in administrative proceedings that resemble commission hearings. Similar to Seattle’s system at issue here, the State provides an administrative forum in which civil service employees can challenge disciplinary decisions and appeal to the State’s Personnel Resources Board (Board). <em>See </em>ch. 41.06 RCW; ch. 357-52 WAC.

While some definitions of “action” are restricted to proceedings within a court of law, we emphasized that others define the term more broadly to include other types of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 40-41 <em>(“Black’s Law Dictionary </em>defines ‘action’ as a ‘civil or criminal judicial proceeding,’ ‘an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice,’ and ‘any judicial proceeding, which, if conducted to a determination, will result in a judgment or decree.’ Black’s Law Dictionary 28-29 (7th ed. 1999). <em>[American Jurisprudence] </em>defines ‘action’ as ‘a judicial proceeding in which one asserts a right or seeks redress for a wrong.’ 1 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Actions </em>§ 4, at 725-26 (1994).”).

Because RCW 49.48-.030 is a remedial statute, which must be construed to effectuate its purpose, we find no reason to not interpret “action” to include arbitration proceedings. A restrictive interpretation of “action” would preclude recovery of attorney fees in cases involving arbitration even though the employee is successful in recovering wages or salary owed.

All parties were represented by counsel. Prior to the hearing, the parties conducted discovery and exchanged lists of witnesses and exhibits. Although the hearing examiner was not bound by the Rules of Evidence, she issued evidentiary rulings pursuant to the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure (Commission Rules) and ruled on motions. <em>See </em>Commission Rule 5.13(A) (witnesses are subject to cross-examination), 5.14 (authorizing the parties to file and the presiding officer to rule on motions and allowing oral argument on motions), 5.15 (evidentiary rules).

Following the hearing, the parties submitted closing arguments in written briefing. The hearing examiner issued a 25-page order, including 84 findings of fact and 41 conclusions along with a “Decision and Order” reversing the employees’ discipline and awarding back pay and benefits.

When viewed in light of the statute’s remedial purpose and protection of employee wage recovery, an employee who recovers a judgment for wages in a proceeding that permits this level of pretrial discovery, written briefing, exhibits, witnesses, cross-examination, evidentiary rulings, and detailed findings and decision is permitted to recover attorney fees for an “action” under RCW 49.48.030.</p>

The plaintiff in <em>Cohn </em>requested attorney fees from an administrative body that apparently had no statutory authority to provide attorney fees because it was limited to awarding employees only certain types of remedies. In turn, the superior court and Court of Appeals reviewing the agency’s refusal to grant attorney fees held they could not order that body to exercise a power that it did not possess. Here, in contrast, even if we were to accept <em>Cohn, </em>the case on which <em>Trachtenberg </em>relies, and even assuming the Commission similarly has no authority to award attorney fees, Arnold is not asking the Commission to exceed its authority and grant her attorney fees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Instead, Arnold instituted a separate proceeding in superior court, filing a new complaint solely for that court to award her attorney fees under RCW 49.48.030.

Everett claimed that RCW 49.48.030 did not allow a separate action for attorney fees. We rejected Everett’s restrictive reading of the statute, explaining that RCW 49.48.030 provides attorney fees for “ ‘any action’ ” in which a judgment for wages is recovered, and is not limited to <em>“the same </em>action” in which the wages or salary are recovered. <em>Fire Fighters, </em>146 Wn.2d at 43-44 (quoting RCW 49.48.030).</p>

The City points out that we have suggested employees may waive attorney fees under RCW 49.48.030 through collective bargaining agreements, <em>see Fire Fighters, </em>146 Wn.2d at 49, and asserts that employees entering civil service employment similarly waive their rights to fees under RCW 49.48.030 when they accept the benefits of this employment relationship.

The City fears that allowing attorney fees in civil service proceedings will create a disincentive for local governments to voluntarily adopt these codes and may result in limiting or eliminating the reach of employee protections in civil service codes. The City also suggests that public employers may be more hesitant to discipline employees if attorney fee awards are available to employees.</p>

Even if the City means to protect employees through its civil service <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>system, if by doing so it creates an “action” that allows payment of wages, the City cannot avoid a legislative directive allowing prevailing employees to recover attorney fees. We find nothing to indicate that the legislature meant to exempt the City’s civil service law from RCW 49.48.030. The legislature has shown it knows how to exempt public employees, particularly local government employees, in the context of other wage laws but has not done so here. <em>See </em>RCW 49.48.080 (exempting certain state and local government employees from Department of Labor and Industries wage enforcement laws). In addition, the consequences may not be as significant as the City suggests. Applying RCW 49.48.030 to commission proceedings will not necessarily result in expensive attorney fee awards or discourage employers from disciplining employees because the statute allows for attorney fees only in circumstances when the employer’s discipline was wrongful and the employee is successful in recovering wages. Moreover, in <em>Fire Fighters </em>we recognized that RCW 49.48.030’s purpose of allowing aggrieved employees or their representatives “to pursue wage claims that they may not have otherwise been able to pursue” prevailed over the employers’ economic interests and expectations that each side would bear its own costs. 146 Wn.2d at 50.</p>
    <p id="b584-4" data-blocks='[["BL_584.4",584,[197,1683,1252,586]]]'>¶42 Finally, our decision does not necessarily extend attorney fee awards under RCW 49.48.030 to all quasi-judicial proceedings. RCW 49.48.030 is limited to “actions” in which an employee recovers wages, and we have considered only the court’s authority to award attorney fees requested in a separate action. We hold that when an employee recovers wages in a proceeding with sufficient judicial hallmarks to constitute an “action” and seeks attorney fees in a separate court action, she is entitled to recover attorney fees in that separate proceeding under RCW 49.48.030.</p>

Former RCW 49.48.030 (1888). When the legislature amended this statute in 1971, it eliminated references to ‘The court,” “plaintiff,” and “sue,” which all insinuate traditional courtroom litigation, and instead broadly allowed attorney fees for wages recovered “[i]n <em>any action'' </em>S.B. 261 (emphasis added).</p>

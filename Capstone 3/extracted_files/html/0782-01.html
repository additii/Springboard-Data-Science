There is no repealing clause found anywhere in act 88. Therefore, so far as this citation is concerned, it has no application, because, it could be neither express nor implied repeal, when no such clause is found in the act. It could not suspend the act by implication because there is no conflict, as we conclude, that the word “bank” used in act 88 necessarily means the bank over which the Bank Commissioner has jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b805-8" data-blocks='[["BL_805.8",805,[174,1979,1197,452]]]'>The contention by the appellee is that act 88, an act regulating the banking department, suspends for two years the operation of the law regulating cooperative associations, without mentioning said law.

J. 904, as follows: “An implied repeal is one which takes place when a new law contains provisions which are contrary to, but do not expressly repeal, those of a former law. A statute, or a provision thereof, may be repealed by implication. Whether it has been so repealed is a question of legislative intent. While such a repeal is not favored, nevertheless it must be recognized and accorded effect where it is apparent that it was intended. Conversely, there is no room for repeal by implication where no legislative intent to repeal is indicated or expressed, or an intent not to repeal is apparent or manifest. ’ ’</p>
    <p id="b806-5" data-blocks='[["BL_806.4",806,[295,1012,1194,858]]]'>The same authority also states: “The repeal of statutes by implication is not favored. The courts are slow to hold that one statute has repealed another by implication, and they will not make such an adjudication if they can avoid doing so consistently or on any reasonable hypothesis, or if they can arrive at another result by any construction which is fair and reasonable. Also, the courts will not enlarge the meaning of one act in order to hold that it repeals another by implication, nor will they adopt an interpretation leading to an adjudication of repeal by implication unless it is inevitable, and a very clear and definite reason therefor can be assigned. Furthermore, the courts will not adjudge a statute to have been repealed by implication unless a legislative intention to repeal or supersede the statute plainly and clearly appears. The implication must be clear, necessary and irresistible.” 59 C. J. 905 <em>et seq.</em>

This position, if taken, is not warranted by any reasonable interpretation of that act when it is viewed in the light of, and considered in connection with, contemporaneous legislation.</p>
    <p id="b809-5" data-blocks='[["BL_809.6",809,[193,895,1207,1077]]]'>At the session of the General Assembly at which act No. 632, <em>supra, </em>was passed, the Legislature, by act No. 496, covered the entire field of the control of banks and the manner in which their affairs might be conducted, and, as there was no reference made to this legislation by act No. 632, which was approved only three days later, it is clear that the Legislature did not intend to clothe cooperative associations with the power to carry on the business intrusted to banks. In arriving at the meaning of any statute, it should be placed beside other relevant statutes giving it a meaning and effect derived from the combined whole <em>(State </em>v. <em>Sewell, </em><a href="/ark/45/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="45 Ark. 387" data-case-ids="1892077" data-case-paths="/ark/45/0387-01">45 Ark. 387</a>), for the Legislature must be presumed to have had knowledge of existing statutes and to have had reference thereto when dealing with any subject embraced in prior acts and intend the provisions of later statutes to be read in the light of the provisions of the former relating to the same subject. This is especially true where the statutes were enacted at the same session of the Legislature.

The act itself defines cooperative associations as “a business concern that distributes the net profits of its business by: First, by the payment of a fixed dividend upon its stock; the remainder of its profits are :pro-rated to its several stockholders upon their purchases from, or sales to, said concern, or both such purchases and sales. ’ ’ By section 2, it is pro<a id="p792" href="#p792" data-label="792" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*792</a>vided that twenty or more persons may form the association “for the purpose of conducting any agricultural, dairy, mercantile, banking*, mining, manufacturing, or mechanical business on the cooperative plan.”</p>
    <p id="b810-5" data-blocks='[["BL_810.4",810,[275,564,1203,1175]]]'>When the definition quoted is read in connection with the grant of power, the real reason and purpose of the act is better understood. This was to give groups of individuals an opportunity to co-ordinate their efforts, provide for collective bargaining and share the profits of the enterprise conducted. The conduct of any of the acts named is ancillary and in aid of this main purpose, and the right to pursue and perform these is not unlimited but is to be confined within the bounds of the association’s membership where such acts comprise the engaging in any business clothed with a public interest, and, as such, subject to regulation and supervision by the State. Banks are such institutions over which, by appropriate legislation, the State had exercised its powers of regulation prior to the passage of act No. 632. Therefore, the banking business mentioned in that act must be deemed to be different from the business conducted by a bank properly so-called and of a special and restricted character limited solely to the membership from which perhaps it may receive deposits and make loans to the members, but has no power to engage in the business of a bank which deals with the public generally and which was created and regulated by existing laws.</p>

No other person was with the deceased on this platform. The undisputed proof is that it was a cold night, snowing and sleeting. The evidence shows that a very short time before the injury and death of deceased, he went down to the floor of the derrick, and while there, before he started back to the fourhle board, he told Durio, who was in charge of the work, that the platform was slippery, slick and dangerous, and that he needed some sand. Mr. Durio told him that he had but little more work to do, and told him to go back up and do the work, assuring him that it was safe to finish the work without getting the sand. In obedience, to the order of the foreman, deceased went up to the fourble board and finished his work. One or two witnesses testified that they went to the fourble board shortly after the accident, and that it was not slippery, but it is hardly believable that, the snow and sleet having fallen on the fourble board, it would not be slippery and dangerous. At any rate, this was a question for the jury, and, under the evidence in this case, while there is some, conflict, the jury had a right to believe that the fourble board was covered with snow and sleet, and was slick and dangerous, and that this condition caused the fall of the deceased, and his death.</p>

Whether, under the evidence in this case, the master had exercised care to furnish a safe place in which to work, was a question for the jury, and the evidence is sufficient to show that, because of the sleet and snow and slippery condition of the platform, the place was not safe, and the jury was also justified in finding that the deceased asked for sand in order to make his footing more sure, and that he, at the direction of the foreman, who assured him that it was safe, went back and undertook to perform, and did perform his duty on the platform.</p>

If the platform was slippery and dangerous, and this was the cause of deceased’s death, while he himself was in the exercise of ordinary care, the master is liable. The evidence shows not only that he had gone onto the fourble ¡board as directed, but that he had completed his work. It is contended, however, that the appellants furnished him a leather belt about four inches wide to be worn by him, and the belt was attached to a rope so that if he slipped or fell, he could only fall a very few feet if he had the .belt on. But it is contended that he did not have the belt on; that if he had he could not have fallen.</p>

Moreover, the evidence shows that the foreman instructed him after that time that he must not Avork up there without the belt. One witness testified that at one time the foreman was so careful in this particular, that he stopped the engine to require the derrick man to put on his belt. The deceased had begun work on the night that he was injured about 7 p. mv and had been working there from that time until his injury, except the feAv minutes that he was doAvn on the floor of the derrick at the time he told the foreman that the platform was slippery, and that he needed sand.</p>

If the proof showed that he Avas working there without the belt, this Avould be evidence of contributory negligence on his part, but would in no way tend to show that the master was not guilty of negligence. The presumption is, unless there is evidence to the contrary,.that the master Avas not negligent, and for that reason it is necessary for the servant to show that the master Avas guilty of negligence; but it is equally true that the servant is presumed to be in the exercise of ordinary care, and for that reason the burden is upon the master to show that the servant was not in the exercise of care.

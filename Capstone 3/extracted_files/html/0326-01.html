    <p class="summary" id="b351-3" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[200,439,1211,1125]]]'>Prior to tbe enactment of act 534 of 1921, chancery clerks were not called npon to perform the duties there enumerated, hence this was an additional service which was not in the mind of the Legislature of 1909 when it passed the salary act. The case in <a href="/ark/88/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="88 Ark. 386" data-case-ids="1517137" data-case-paths="/ark/88/0386-01">88 Ark. 386</a>, relied upon by appellee in the lower court, is not in point. That act contemplated the doing of the things which were the subject of the controversy, and was a salary act providing that the salary mentioned was in full compensation of all services which -the clerk was required by law to perform. The offices of circuit clerk and chancery clerk are separate, and the act in question was intended to give the chancery clerk additional compensation for doing something that had not before been required of him. Const. 1874, art. 7, § 19. 110 IT. S. 688' contains a discussion on the question of title to emoluments in cases of dual offices. In case of one officer holding dual offices, where provision is made for services rendered in each capacity, compensation should be made according to the provisions of the statute that applies to it, rather than to deny it on technical grounds. <a href="/f/15/0641-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="15 F. 641" data-case-ids="3777978" data-case-paths="/f/15/0641-01">15 Fed. 641</a>.</p>

    <p id="b352-4" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[296,848,1201,460]]]'>By act 249 of the Acts of 1905 (Acts 1905, p. 653) certain officers of Benton County were placed on salaries. By § 1 of this act it is provided “that the clerk of the circuit court and ex-officio clerk of the chancery court of Benton County shall be allowed fees as follows:” and there follows a list of fees which may be charged, after which list the following sentence appears; “For services not above specified, fees should be charged as provided by the statute.”</p>
    <p id="b352-5" data-blocks='[["BL_352.6",352,[297,1320,1201,609]]]'>Section 5 of this act 249 requires the officers whose fees are fixed to keep a record of all fees earned; and § 6 requires the payment of those fees into the county treasury each quarter. Section 7 provides the annual salary of the circuit clerk, which is made payable quarterly, and further provides that the salary there fixed shall be full compensation “for all the services required of him'by law as such circuit clerk, ex-officio recorder, chancery clerk, and commissioner. ” There have been amendments to this salary act, but the provisions about charging and collecting and paying over fees have not been changed.</p>

Keeling was the circuit clerk of <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>Searcy Comity, and there was a special act fixing his compensation which is not substantially different from the Benton County act on that subject. Keeling .took the affidavits of certain persons who had entered government lands, and charged the fees which were fixed by the act of Congress for that service. It was held by this court that the salary act “ embraces every fee or emolument accruing to the clerk by reason of his official capacity, and allows the withholding of none. It includes every fee that was earned by him in his official capacity” (•Cases cited).</p>
    <p id="b353-3" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[208,977,1203,608]]]'>Counsel for appellant seek to distinguish that case as applied to the facts of this, upon the ground that the fees there in question had been fixed before the Searcy County act was passed; whereas the fees here in controversy were provided for after the passage of the salary act and the acts amendatory thereof. We think, however, that this difference is unimportant. The act of 1921 is, in effect, so far as it affects the question at issue, an amendment of the fee-bill found in § 1 of the salary act of 1905, and must be treated as one .of the fees provided for by law which he is required to collect and account for under § 6 of that act.</p>
    <p id="b353-4" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[208,1594,1199,97]]]'>The decree of the court below accorded with this view, and it is therefore affirmed.</p>

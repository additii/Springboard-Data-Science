She sold this land to B. W. and D. R. Fawcett, conveying the same to them by deed which it was subsequently found misdescribed the property intended to be and actually conveyed. The Fawcett brothers took possession of this land; on certain parcels thereof erected their homes, and on others store buildings and conveyed several parcels of it to others. After a time, except as to their homestead lots and the parcels before conveyed to others, they conveyed the property to J. A. Hughes by mortgage deed to secure an indebtedness. This mortgage was afterward foreclosed, a sale made by the commissioner of the court under the decree of foreclosure, report of sale made and confirmed, and a deed made to the purchaser, J. A. Hughes. This title passed by mesne conveyances to Mrs. Allie Rhyne. The purchasers under the foreclosure sale took actual possession of the property, and this possession continued until it became the property of Mrs. Rhyne, who also took possession and remained in such possession continuously until the present.</p>

A controversy, the particulars of which are not important, arose between the two which resulted in' Mrs. Rhyne instituting an action in the circuit court to establish her title to a small portion of the original Guinn tract which was in dispute between her and Fawcett. She based her title on the decree under foreclosure sale and deeds thereunder and on a quitclaim deed from a Mrs. Smith, sole surviving heir of Mrs. Guinn, deceased. Fawcett answered deny<a id="p942" href="#p942" data-label="942" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*942</a>ing Mrs. Rhyne’s title under the muniments of title exhibited, averred title in himself by mesne conveyances from Mrs. Guinn. (D. R. Fawcett had long previously conveyed to B. W. Fawcett his interest in the Guinn tract.) He alleged there was a mistake in the description of the land made in his conveyances; that upon the execution of the deed under which he claimed he took possession of the land “built a home and established his residence with that of his family thereon, and at all times thereafter until the filing of this action he has occupied the lands so conveyed peaceably, etc.,” except as to certain tracts which he and his co-tenant, D. R. Fawcett, had previously conveyed to others. He further alleged that he had “used and occupied openly, adversely and without interruption a strip of land 46 feet wide on the north end of said land, and extending from the west boundary line of his grant and west 109 feet to the west line of land conveyed to Rebecca Fawcett, as herein-before referred to; also a parcel of land connected with the strip just referred to.on the south 19 feet wide and extending in a southerly direction from the strip just mentioned along and parallel with the west line of the land so conveyed to Rebecca Fawcett a distance of 60 feet, more or less, to the northeast corner of the property conveyed to A.

To set out the decree in full would unduly extend this opinion, but it recites the pleading-s, the documentary evidence and the testimony of the witnesses on which it was based. It finds that the original deed from Mrs. Guinn incorrectly described the land sought to be conveyed, that this defect in description continued under the deeds made subsequently under which B. "W. Fawcett claimed title, and that all of said deeds should be reformed. It recited the execution of the mortgage deed and proceedings thereunder and the execution of the deeds in pursuance thereof to Mrs. Rhyne and her predecessors in title, and found that she and they had been in possession of the property adversely for more than seven years, and that the true description of the property in the mortgage was as described in the deed of Mrs. Smith. (It will be noted that in the pleadings filed by Mrs. Rhyne there was no allegation of misdescription in the mortgage from Fawcetts to Hughes, the decree and proceedings thereunder and deeds based thereon, or prayer for their reformation.)</p>

Continuing, the court made the further recital that plaintiff in open court disclaimed any title to the lands described in the deed from D. R. Fawcett to B. W. Fawcett and that described in the <a id="p945" href="#p945" data-label="945" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*945</a>original Guinn deed, other than that described in her deed from Mrs. Smith and that the defendant “is the owner of, and in possession, of all that lot and parcel of land set ont and described in the deed from D.

Guinn survey * * * and that the title and possession of defendant in and to all of said land should be forever quieted and confirmed in B. W. Fawcett against all the claims of the plaintiff, and those holding through her.” After these findings follows the formal decree, which first decrees a reformation of the deeds under which Fawcett claimed, that title to a parcel of land 106 feet north and south by 90 feet east and west, which is described, is in Mrs. Rhyne, and that her right to possession therein and her title thereto be confirmed. Second, it was decreed as follows: “That B. W. Fawcett be and he is hereby decreed to own in fee simple a strip of land 18 feet in width from east to west lying immediately east of the tract of land herein decreed to be owned by the plaintiff, and his title thereto is forever confirmed and quieted, in himself as against the plaintiff and all persons claiming through her.

She set up title by reason of said possession. She further alleged that her title was derived through certain foreclosure proceedings and deeds based thereon which she specifically pleaded and exhibited with her intervention; that it was the intention in the said proceedings and deeds to convey the parcel of land named in plaintiff’s complaint, but that said proceedings and deeds incorrectly described the lands, and that same should be reformed. Intervener further alleged that the decree under which plaintiff claimed was not the. decree rendered by the court, and that a part thereof was obtained by fraudulent representation made to it. The intervention concluded with a motion to transfer the cause to equity to the end that the decrees, orders of the court, and deeds under which she claimed be reformed and corrected so as to correctly describe the lands thereby intended to be conveyed, and that the decree of December 14, 1931, pleaded by plaintiff be vacated and set aside; alleged her title by adverse possession and pleaded the statute bar. On the same date of the filing of the. intervention Mrs. Rhyne filed her motion in the chancery court to vacate the decree pleaded <a id="p947" href="#p947" data-label="947" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*947</a>by plaintiff on the ground that it was procured by fraud practiced on the court.</p>

The only thing that is clear relating to the location of the property is that the parcel of land described in the complaint of Fawcett in the instant case lies along the extreme southern boundary of the original Guinn tract, and that the pleadings and evidence indicate that the lands actually involved in the first suit lay to the north and were parts of the north or northwest portion of the original Guinn tract.</p>
    <p id="b968-5" data-blocks='[["BL_968.4",968,[295,786,1202,1020]]]'>The first question in the case relates to the power of the court to vacate its decree or modify the same after the expiration of the term in which it was handed down. The only power to vacate a decree after lapse of the term is to be found in the statute or by a bill of review in equity on the ground of newly-discovered evidence or for error of law apparent on the face of the record. In this proceeding there was no claim of mistake of law or of newly-discovered evidence, but the appellee relied on the allegation which in effect charged that the decree was procured by fraud practiced on the court. On this question testimony was taken, much of which we deem it unnecessary to review at length, it being a sufficient reason, if no other existed, that the court did not find that there had been any such fraud practiced. In fact, the evidence, to our mind, is conclusive that everything done by the attorney for appellant in relation to the suggestion made by him as to the drafting and phrasing of the decree was done in open court in the presence of opposing counsel.</p>

Indeed, we are constrained to the view that the learned trial judge misinterpreted the testimony of Fawcett and failed to reach a just conclusion as to the true inference arising from it. We have carefully examined his testimony, and that relating to his adversary possession of the parts of the Guinn tract claimed by him was clearly referable to the specific allegations contained in his pleadings and the pleadings of his adversary. In his pleadings Fawcett was not contending for the parcel of land here involved, and, of course, his testimony could not justly be held to refer to it. This indubitably appears when his-testimony in the instant case is considered, for he states that during the progress of the original lawsuit and at the time he testified therein he was fully aware that appellee was in actual possession of the subject-matter of this suit, and he then made no claim to it, nor did he do so until after the decree was rendered, and then only on the information of this attorney that the land had been decreed to him. In explaining why he claimed this parcel in the instant case when he did not in the former, he stated that if “she (appellee) tried to take something that doesn’t belong to her, I will take something that doesn’t belong to me.”</p>

This action, an ejectment suit, was properly instituted in a court of law. In the intervention filed by the appellee it was alleged, among other things, that she was the owner of the parcel of land acquired by reason of certain decrees and proceedings thereunder which divested title of appellant in the land and vested it in her, and it was the intention of the parties to the mortgage that the identical land involved be included therein, but that there was a mistake and misdescription therein which was brought forward and continued in the descriptions in the decrees <a id="p950" href="#p950" data-label="950" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*950</a>and other proceedings and the deeds based thereon, and she prayed for reformation of these deeds, decrees and other proceedings.

J. Clingan, as hereinbefore referred to, at which point the width is reduced to 14 feet and so continues in a southerly direction to the southwest corner of the said Rebecca Fawcett land.” Continuing, he averred that the said strips just described had been in his exclusive possession and used solely and exclusively as a roadway and means of ingress and egress from certain roads and highways into his residence, outhouses and other inclosures, and that he had no other way of ingress and egress therefrom or thereto during all the time of his possession, and that no other person had any right or interest in the same.

The pleadings are obscure, and appellant’s understanding strengthens the conclusion that the general averment related only to this special allegation. That being true, the tract of land involved in this suit was not within the issues raised at the former trial. Indeed, it is our opinion that the decree rendered did not, in fact, adjudicate or attempt to adjudicate the subject-matter of this controversy.

      <a id="p953" href="#p953" data-label="953" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*953</a>On an examination of the decree, it appears that there was a general finding to the effect that the appellant was entitled to have his title quieted and confirmed as to all the lands in the deed from D. R. Fawcett to him except the lands described therein as belonging to the appellee, and it is also true that the particular tract appellant now seeks to recover was not included in the description of appellee’s land contained in her pleadings or decree and that she disclaimed all title to any property not included in such description. This disavowal, however, does not aid the appellant, for it is on his own averments of ownership and the evidence adduced to support them that his title must rest. The only specific finding of the court was that title* rested in the appellant to an 18-foot strip of land described in that finding. When it comes to the decree proper, there were only two subjects relative to which the decree made an adjudication: (a) that certain deeds be reformed, and (b) that appellant’s title to the said 18-foot strip be quieted and confirmed.</p>

Those pleadings, as we have seen, did not include the subject-matter of this proceeding, or raise any issues with respect to it; nor did the decree adjudge to the appellant, either specially or generally, title in the lands now in controversy or confirm that title in him. For either of these reasons the plea of <em>res judicata </em>invoked has no application; and, since the chancery court acquired jurisdiction for the purpose of reforming appellee’s muniments of title, it might, and should, retain jurisdiction for all purposes and finally settle the lawsuit. <em>Fulcher </em>v. <em>Dierks Lbr.

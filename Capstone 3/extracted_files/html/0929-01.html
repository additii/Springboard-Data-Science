As the teacher prepared to lead the children from the classroom to the school bus, she heard a loud pop. Looking around, the teacher saw one child bent over with blood on her hands. She summoned other staff, and before long they realized that the bloodied child had been shot.</p>

First, RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a) requires proof that the defendant acted with the same mens rea as that required for “the crime.” We have previously interpreted the words “the crime” in other subsections of the complicity statute very narrowly. We have said that “the crime” means intent to promote the crime that was actually charged, not just any crime. <em>State v. Cronin, </em><a href="/wash-2d/142/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="142 Wash. 2d 568" data-case-ids="1361345" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/142/0568-01">142 Wn.2d 568</a>, 579, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20P.3d%20752" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="14 P.3d 752">14 P.3d 752</a> (2000); <em>State v.

Using that same narrow interpretation here, we find evidence of such mens rea was <a id="p945" href="#p945" data-label="945" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*945</a>lacking. Bauer may have been negligent about leaving loaded guns out in the presence of children. TC may have been negligent about enabling a gun enclosed in a backpack to discharge. Bauer’s negligence was thus not the same as the culpability required for “the crime”; it might have been equally negligent, but not as to the same act, result, and balancing of costs and benefits. Any negligence on Bauer’s part thus does not meet the definition of culpability for “the crime” required by RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a). Since any negligence on his part was not “culpability . . . sufficient for the commission of the crime,” RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a), Bauer cannot be liable under prong (2)(a).</p>

There, we analyzed the meaning of “cause” in a different statute, RCW 9.68A.040(1)(b), that criminalizes “causing] a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct.” We held that to “cause” a child to engage in sexually explicit behavior “requires some affirmative act of assistance, interaction, influence or communication on the part of a defendant which initiates and results in a child’s display of sexually explicit conduct.” <em>Chester, </em>133 Wn.2d at 22. The legislature probably intended “cause” to mean the same thing in the statute at issue here, RCW 9A.08.020(2)(a), that criminalizes “caus[ing] an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in [illegal] conduct.” But there is no evidence of any such interaction here that would permit a finding that Bauer “caused” TC to take a gun to school. <em>See id.; </em>Hart &amp; Honoré, <em>supra, </em>at 363-64, 368 (discussing the significant difference between causing a result and causing another actor to engage in behavior); <em>see also </em>Hart &amp; Honoré, <em>supra, </em>at 367 (“ ‘causing’ a person to act refers to a species of the genus ‘inducing’ or ‘instigating’ ”).</p>

Bauer asserts that the State has failed to make a prima facie case that his conduct of leaving guns around his house loaded and accessible to invited children “caused” the bodily harm here. We agree. Although causation in fact is the same in criminal and civil cases, legal causation is not. Our case law suggests that legal causation does not extend as far in criminal cases as it does in tort cases, and even our civil cases do not extend liability as far as the State seeks to do in this case.

These weapons were easily accessible to his girlfriend’s minor children, including TC, a nine-year-old boy who frequently visited and sometimes stayed the night. Unsupervised, TC put one of Bauer’s handguns into his backpack. Two days later, that gun, still in TC’s backpack, discharged in a classroom, seriously injuring one of TC’s classmates. Bauer did not notice his handgun was missing until after the shooting. The majority believes that because nine-year-old TC did not have permission to take the weapon and because two days elapsed between the taking and the subsequent shooting, Bauer’s carelessness could not, as a matter of law, be the cause of the victim’s serious injury. <em>See </em>majority at 942, 946.

The jury would be able to consider all of the relevant <a id="p949" href="#p949" data-label="949" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*949</a>circumstances, including the age and maturity of the child, the child’s familiarity with firearms, and the precautions the firearm owner took or did not take, to determine if the firearm owner’s conduct amounts to criminal negligence. What the majority believes to be the intervening actions and attenuating circumstances in this case are the natural and foreseeable consequences of the very danger that Bauer’s careless actions created.</p>
    <p id="b1013-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1013.5",1013,[128,799,1256,1349]]]'>¶44 TC’s picking up the handgun and Bauer’s failure to notice are not intervening causes in the ultimate injury. Like the majority, I do not believe “Bauer’s act of gun ownership” or “[h]is decision to keep loaded weapons around the house” is in itself criminal. <em>See </em>majority at 939. But it need not be. Third degree assault predicated on criminal negligence does not require an underlying illegal act or an intentional act but merely criminal negligence that results in bodily harm. RCW 9A.36.031(1)(d). By its plain language, the purpose of the statute is to impose liability when injury is caused by criminal negligence, not criminal intent or felonious action. <em><a href="/citations/?q=293%20JAMA%20707" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="293 JAMA 707">Id.</a> </em>A defendant can face liability for criminal negligence “when he or she fails to be aware of a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and his or her failure to be aware of such substantial risk constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation.” RCW 9A.08.010(l)(d). TC’s actions are not distinct from Bauer’s carelessness for legal causation purposes. When Bauer’s gun ownership and method of storage is combined with the known presence of an unsupervised nine-year-old boy, especially when coupled with a failure to notice the unsecured weapon was missing, a jury, not a judge, should decide if this created a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur.</p>

Not only do I find this <a id="p950" href="#p950" data-label="950" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*950</a>troubling in light of behavioral science, but also I agree with the legislature that “[c]hildren of eight and under twelve years of age are presumed to be incapable of committing crime.” RCW 9A.04.050. Though this presumption may be removed, <em>see </em><a href="/citations/?q=293%20JAMA%20707" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="293 JAMA 707">id.,</a> and I do not seek to address the appropriateness of the liability imposed on TC, it is unsettling that TC, as a matter of law, will face more criminal culpability in this situation than Bauer.</p>
    <p id="b1014-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1014.5",1014,[207,788,1254,577]]]'>¶46 At its core, this case comes down to considerations of sound policy. Bauer kept a loaded, unsecured handgun in a room that an unsupervised nine-year-old boy could access freely. Bauer also did not notice that this loaded weapon had been taken for two days as TC toted it in his backpack to and from school. Given that both science and common sense strongly suggest that Bauer was in the best position to prevent the injury to TC’s classmate and that his conduct was its primary cause, I would not preclude Bauer’s liability on legal causation grounds and would allow a jury to resolve the matter.</p>

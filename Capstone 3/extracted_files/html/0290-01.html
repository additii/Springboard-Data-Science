Peltier on September 6, 2002 with two counts of second degree rape (as to B.M. and S.B.), one count of second degree child molestation (as to S.G.), and one count of second degree rape of a child (as to S.G.). The crimes occurred between 1993 and 2001. On July 14, 2003, to accommodate a negotiated settlement of his case, Peltier agreed to a stipulated trial on an amended information charging him with third degree rape (as to B.M. and J.D., a victim not referenced in the original information) and indecent liberties (as to S.B.). The charges as to S.G. were dismissed. On January 28, 2004, the trial judge found Peltier guilty and sentenced him. The statute of limitations on the four original charges had not yet run, but the statute of limitations for the charges he was convicted of had expired by January 1998, well before he was charged with and sentenced for them.</p>

In 2011, toward the end of Peltier’s sentence, the State filed a sexually violent predator (SVP) petition pursuant to chapter 71.09 RCW. After a trial, the SVP petition was granted. Peltier then filed a personal restraint petition (PRP) challenging the constitutionality of his original conviction. The State did not dispute this PRP, and the Court of Appeals, Division One, ruled that the original judgment and sentence for third degree rape and indecent liberties was invalid on its face since both charges in the amended information were filed beyond the statute of limitations. This PRP was granted, and the Court of Appeals ordered the charges to be vacated and dismissed.</p>

Traditionally, whether a criminal statute of limitations can be waived depends on the characterization of these statutes. A guilty plea waives all defenses other than the failure of the information to charge an offense. <em>In re Habeas Corpus of Garrison, </em><a href="/wash-2d/75/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="75 Wash. 2d 98" data-case-ids="1082876" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/75/0098-01">75 Wn.2d 98</a>, 101, <a href="/citations/?q=449%20P.2d%2092" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="449 P.2d 92">449 P.2d 92</a> (1968).

      <em>Id. </em>at 353. Our constitution gives original jurisdiction to the superior court in all criminal cases amounting to a felony. Wash. Const, art. IV, § 6.

Because of this, the court held that the charges were beyond the statutory authority of the court. <em>Stoudmire, </em>141 Wn.2d at 355. The court said, “ ‘[A] plea bargaining agreement cannot exceed the statutory authority given to the courts.’ ” <em><a href="/wash-app/176/0732-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="176 Wash.

This waiver must be express. Generally, criminal defendants can waive rights that exist for their own benefit, and this is no different. <em>Cowan v. Superior Court, </em><a href="/cal-4th/14/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="14 Cal. 4th 367" data-case-ids="341415" data-case-paths="/cal-4th/14/0367-01">14 Cal. 4th 367</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=926%20P.2d%20438" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="926 P.2d 438">926 P.2d 438</a>, 439, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20458" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="58 Cal. Rptr. 2d 458">58 Cal. Rptr. 2d 458</a> (1996). If it proves more advantageous for a defendant to waive a statute of limitations that has not expired, he or she should be able to do so. <em>Peltier, </em><a href="/wash-app/176/0732-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="176 Wash.

Accordingly, a defendant may expressly waive any objections to timeliness when the statute of limitations has not yet run on the underlying charges, and the court thus still has authority to sentence on the charges if convicted.</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[205,588,1248,738]]]'>¶16 Here, the statute of limitations on the four greater charges were all still valid at the time Peltier entered the stipulated agreement in exchange for being charged with the two lesser crimes. In the agreement upon stipulation, he expressly waived his right to object to the expiration of the statute of limitations if his subsequent challenge of the agreement led to the refiling of the original charges. Peltier challenged the agreement, and the State refiled the original charges. Even though the statute of limitations has run on the refiled charges, the stipulation upon agreement was executed when the court still had the authority to sentence and so the waiver therein is valid. Peltier is precluded from objecting to the refiling of the original charges based on untimeliness.</p>

    <p id="b340-6" data-blocks='[["BL_340.6",340,[205,1483,1252,584]]]'>¶17 A statute of limitations does not affect a court’s subject matter jurisdiction; it affects the authority of a court to sentence a defendant for a crime. A defendant may expressly waive a criminal statute of limitations when he or she agrees to do so when the statute of limitations has not yet run on the underlying charges. At that time, the court has authority over the charges, so an express waiver is effective and will be upheld. Peltier waived the statute of limitations when the charges were still valid. We reverse the Court of Appeals and the trial court and hold that the State may refile the original charges.</p>

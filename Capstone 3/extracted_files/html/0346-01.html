In August 2006, Dawn Matsunaga rear-ended the car that Cathy Johnston-Forbes was riding in. Johnston-Forbes claimed that she suffered injuries as a result of the collision and sued Matsunaga. Before trial, Matsunaga identified Dr. Allan Tencer as an expert who would be testifying as a biomechanical engineer. In a motion in limine, Johnston-Forbes moved to exclude Tencer’s testimony, arguing that he was not qualified as an engineer, that his opinion lacked sufficient foundation, and that in viewing photographs he could not account for Johnston-Forbes’s precise body position at the time of <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>impact.

Once a year, the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) holds a tournament in the Portland/Vancouver area. Johnston-Forbes, her husband, and her two young daughters came to Vancouver for the tournament in August 2006. After she finished her first round, Johnston-Forbes and her family were heading back to their hotel room, driving in a Toyota Camry rental car. Johnston-Forbes was seated in the backseat between two car seats holding her two young daughters. They had come to a complete stop for a red light. Johnston-Forbes was leaning forward and twisted back and to the left, facing one of her daughters, when the car was struck from behind by Matsunaga’s Ford Mustang.</p>

Tencer has a doctorate in mechanical engineering and was a professor in biomechanical engineering at the University of Washington for 23 years. In his report, Tencer stated that he reviewed the photos of Matsunaga’s Ford Mustang, a repair bill for Johnston-Forbes’s Toyota Camry, and depositions of Johnston-Forbes and Matsunaga related to the accident. Additionally, he reviewed engineering data on both vehicles and bumper crash test information on the Toyota. He also personally performed impact tests on both bumpers.</p>

At trial, Tencer testified generally about the forces acting on the two vehicles and Johnston-Forbes’s body during the collision. Johnston-Forbes’s cross-examination of Tencer drew out the following facts: (1) Tencer is neither a medical doctor nor a licensed engineer, (2) he did not examine Johnston-Forbes’s vehicle or any photographs of it, (3) a basketball hoop had fallen on Matsunaga’s vehicle between the time of the accident and when she took the photographs of it, and (4) Johnston-Forbes’s body position at the time of the accident could have resulted in greater stress on her body than Tencer’s collision force analysis predicted.</p>

ER 702 generally establishes when expert testimony may be utilized at trial: “If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.”</p>

It is not remarkable that trial judges have sometimes allowed biomechanical engineering testimony, and specifically Tencer’s testimony, where sometimes trial judges have excluded it. For example, in <em>Ma’ele v. Arrington, </em><a href="/wash-app/111/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="111 Wash.

This appears consistent with the approach ER 702 through 705 contemplate. That is, in each case a trial court’s decision is guided by the requirements of the rules in balancing the factors to determine whether such testimony should be admissible in the context of the specific facts in each case.</p>

The Court of Appeals reasoned that Tencer did not offer a medical opinion, as he did not opine as to whether the forces involved in the crash would have caused injuries to anyone in general or to Johnston-Forbes in particular.

Bernard, </em><a href="/wash-2d/151/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="151 Wash. 2d 376" data-case-ids="428165" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/151/0376-01">151 Wn.2d 376</a>, 393, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20P.3d%20939" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="88 P.3d 939">88 P.3d 939</a> (2004). The trial court in this case followed the analytical framework required under the ERs and restricted and limited Tencer’s testimony. The trial court excluded the repair bill reviewed by Tencer and, as a result, instructed the parties that Tencer could not testify about the repair bill. Moreover, Matsunaga’s counsel assured the court that Tencer would not testify about any injuries Johnston-Forbes did or did not sustain as a result of the collision, and on cross-examination, Tencer repeatedly stated during his <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>testimony that he was not testifying about Johnston-Forbes’s injuries.

Because fault was not at issue and because it was undisputed that Johnston-Forbes had a herniated disc in her neck, the jury was charged with determining causation — i.e., whether Matsunaga’s actions were the cause of Johnston-Forbes’s herniated disc. In this case, Tencer’s testimony helped the jury understand what forces might have been involved in the collision and he compared those forces to activities of daily living. He was cross-examined on this conclusion. It was then up to the jury to determine whether they believed Johnston-Forbes experienced the same force of impact and, if so, whether that caused her injury.</p>

Before allowing an expert to render an opinion, the trial court must find that there is an adequate foundation so that an opinion is not mere speculation, conjecture, or misleading.

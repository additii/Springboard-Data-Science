Const, art. I, § 9. In 2006, Mathew Moi was tried for the murder of Keith McGowan and for unlawful possession of the gun that killed McGowan. No physical evidence tied Moi to the gun, and perhaps because of that, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the murder charge. Based on the same evidence, Moi was acquitted of unlawful possession of the gun. On its second try, the State secured a murder conviction, still arguing that McGowan was killed with the gun Moi was acquitted of possessing. The State concedes that the same issue of ultimate fact was decided in both trials but argues it would be unjust to apply double jeopardy against it because it was surprised by Moi’s testimony in the first trial that someone else shot McGowan and because Moi had moved to sever the two charges. Given the State’s concession, we grant the personal restraint petition.</p>

Shortly before the first trial, the State added a charge of unlawful possession of a firearm based on the same constellation of facts alleged in the murder charge. Moi moved to sever the two charges to shield the jury in the murder case from the potential prejudicial effect of knowing he had been convicted of second degree robbery as a juvenile. The State opposed severance, arguing that severing the charges “would require the State to present the exact same case a second time.” Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Oct. 24, 2006) at 236. The State suggested, among other things, that Moi waive his right to a jury trial and have the firearm charge tried to the bench at the same time the murder charge was tried to a jury. Ultimately, the parties agreed to do that.</p>

On September 15, 2010, Gunderson drove up to Seattle to pick up his daughter and take her back to Longview for a visit.

Bonnie testified that they had scuffled in the parking lot as Gunderson tried to leave with his daughter. She recalled Christina, Gunderson, and herself grabbing and wrestling in and around Gunderson’s truck. According to Bonnie, she did not want the truck to leave and was struggling to take the keys. At some point in the commotion, Gunderson was sitting in <a id="p920" href="#p920" data-label="920" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*920</a>the driver’s seat, ducking from Bonnie. On cross-examination, Bonnie told the court that she did not see Gunderson hitting Christina and that her memory was “kind of a big blur.” Tr. of Proceedings (TP) (Oct. 20, 2011) at 37.

Specifically, the State sought to challenge Christina’s credibility, believing that Christina had minimized what had happened between her and Gunderson. Gunderson objected under ER 404(b). The trial judge ruled the evidence admissible, finding that (1) a preponderance of the evidence supported the conclusion that the two incidents occurred, (2) the purpose of the evidence was impeachment of Christina’s credibility, (3) the evidence was relevant, and (4) its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect because it went to witness credibility. As a result of the trial court’s order, the jury received evidence of the two prior domestic violence incidents through Christina’s testimony. The judge gave a limiting instruction, telling the jury that this “testimony was only allowed for the purposes of evaluating [Christina’s] testimony... and for no other purpose.” <em>Id. </em>at 131.

It cannot in any sense bo said that, because he may act in any part of the State in taking affidavits and acknowledgments, he becomes a State officer. Such a holding would be contrary to our previous decisions bearing on the subject. To illustrate: In this State a justice of the peace has always been a township officer, vested under the Constitution with limited judicial powers. In addition to being a judicial officer, the justice is a ministerial officer. The taking of acknowledgments to deeds and the ad<a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>ministering of oaths are ministerial acts. These duties are in no wise connected with the judicial powers of the justice, and, being ministerial, it has been held that the officer performing them is not limited to his appropriate territorial jurisdiction in the performance of them, but that he may take affidavits and acknowledgments in any part of the State <em>Biscoe </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em><a href="/ark/15/0655-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="15 Ark. 655" data-case-ids="8728583" data-case-paths="/ark/15/0655-01">15 Ark. 655</a>.</p>

E. 33</a>, in construing a substantially similar provision of the Constitution of Indiana, the Supreme Court of that State said: “Members of a board of commissioners are certainly county officers, and, by the positive command of the Constitution, they are required to reside within the county where they serve as such officers, and perform such duties as the law may direct. The provision of our fundamental law which restricts residence of a county officer to his county must be construed as requiring him to be a resident thereof, not in the general sense of that term, but he is required to actually reside therein during the time he is the incumbent of the office. This holding is fully supported by the decision in the appeal of <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, <a href="/ind/21/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="21 Ind. 516" data-case-ids="1477484" data-case-paths="/ind/21/0516-01">21 </a></em><a href="/ind/21/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="21 Ind. 516" data-case-ids="1477484" data-case-paths="/ind/21/0516-01">Ind. 516</a>. That the title of a public officer may be terminated and his office vacated by abandonment, is a rule of law settled beyond controversy. As the Constitution exacts of a county officer the duty to actually reside in the county in which he holds his office, if he violates this provision of ¡the law, by voluntarily ceasing to reside therein during his term, it will operate as an abandonment of the office, and <em>ipso facto </em>a surrender of all of his right and title to the office.” (Citing authorities).</p>

Consequently, having abandoned his office by his permanent removal to another county, it became vacant, and he was no longer a <em>de jure </em>officer. An officer <em>de facto </em>must not only perform the duties of the office with public acquiescence, <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>but lie must also be in possession of it. <em>Faucette </em>v. <em>Gerlach, </em><a href="/ark/132/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="132 Ark. 58" data-case-ids="1576772" data-case-paths="/ark/132/0058-01">132 Ark. 58</a>.</p>

When this is done, it is evident that the Legislature intended to make a notary public a county officer, and to create a vacancy in such office when he removed to another county.</p>
    <p id="b249-5" data-blocks='[["BL_249.6",249,[196,1049,1208,1023]]]'>This is indicated not only by sec. 7969, describing the qualifications of the notary, but also by the provisions of sec. 7975, ordering the delivery of his public papers to the county clerk when any notary dies, resigns, removes from the county, or is removed from'office. By necessary implication the statute, when construed in connection with the clause of the Constitution above quoted, makes a permanént removal from the county an abandonment of his office, and creates a vacancy in it. The office is a statutory one, created for the convenience of the inhabitants of a county, and for their convenience the notary may exercise his functions in any part of the State, but this does not make his office migratory. After Templeton removed permanently from Clay County, he abandoned his office and thereby created a vacancy in it. He did not attempt or pretend to keep an office in Clay County, and he could not carry it with him. Therefore he did not remain in possession of his office and thus perform one of the essential requirements of an officer <em>de facto.</em>

The complaint was properly dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and the judgment will be affirmed.</p>

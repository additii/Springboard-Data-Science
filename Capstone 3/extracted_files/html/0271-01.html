He alleged that it was invalid on the ground that the journals of the two houses of the General Assembly do not show that the bill was agreed to in each house, but that the record shows that the bill was not read three times in the House of Representatives, was not placed on final passage, the vote was not taken by “ayes” and “nays,” and the names of the persons voting for and against the same were not entered on the journal.</p>

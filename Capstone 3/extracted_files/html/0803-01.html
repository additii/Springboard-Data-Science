At that time, M.W. was in the physical custody of petitioners Greg and Linda Minium, M.W.’s maternal grandparents. Approximately one month after the accident, the Miniums filed a petition in Cowlitz County Superior Court for nonparental custody of M.W. pursuant to RCW 26.10.030(1). Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 3-7. The petition named Patti Shmilenko, M.W.’s paternal grandmother, as the sole respondent. <em>Id. </em>at 3.

The findings of fact and conclusions of law, custody decree, and residential schedule were all entered as agreed orders, with no independent fact-finding by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 8-12, 15-18, 21-29. The residential schedule specified that the parties would review the visitation schedule when M.W. entered school. <em>Id. </em>at 22. The record is silent as to why Mr. Shmilenko was not included in the court’s orders despite residing in the same household as his wife, but all of the orders explicitly provide for visitation with “Patti Shmi-<a id="p807" href="#p807" data-label="807" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*807</a>lenko.” E.g., <em>id. </em>at 11, 16, 22-24.

Mrs. Shmilenko subsequently petitioned the superior court to modify the original custody decree and residential schedule, naming both herself and her husband as “requesting parties.” <em>Id. </em>at 35 (capitalization omitted). Mrs. Shmilenko also moved for a temporary amended residential schedule. <em>Id. </em>at 49-52. In response, the Miniums asked the court to terminate Mrs. Shmilenko’s visitation rights, contending that her court-ordered, third-party visitation was unconstitutional and that she also was not entitled to visitation under the equitable doctrine of de facto parentage. <em>Id. </em>at 54-59.

In the temporary order, the court did not rule on the Miniums’ argument that third-party visitation is unconstitutional; it also crossed out a reference to Mr. Shmilenko as a “requesting party” and provided for visitation with Mrs. Shmilenko only. <em>Id. </em>at 63.

In his petition, Mr. Shmilenko did not request custody or decision-making authority with respect to M.W. Rather, he requested that the previously entered residential schedule be modified to explicitly give him visitation rights with M.W., stating that he had “maintained a grandparent-grandchild relationship with [M.W.],” and asserting that it was “in [M.W.] ’s best interest that JOHN SHMILENKO have established visitation that will continue even in the event PATTI SHMI-LENKO no longer is able to exercise visitation.” <em>Id. </em>at 159-60. There is no indication in Mr. Shmilenko’s petition that his wife’s visitation rights were in jeopardy. The Miniums opposed the requested relief and argued that the petition should “be dismissed due to lack of adequate cause and as unconstitutional pursuant to ROW 26.10.160(3) and supporting case law.” <em>Id. </em>at 166.</p>

Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Jan. 13, 2014) at 14. Rather than dismiss the action at that point, the court allowed the matter to proceed under a de facto parentage framework and directed Mr. Shmilenko to file an amended petition. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 18.

      <a id="p809" href="#p809" data-label="809" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*809</a>¶10 At the February 24 hearing, the parties and the court all acknowledged the difficulty of trying to fit the facts of the present case into existing statutes or common law doctrine. In his arguments to the court regarding adequate cause, Mr. Shmilenko admitted that the de facto parent analysis was a “rough fit for this case,” but nevertheless asserted that his amended petition reserved the right to seek visitation pursuant to the court’s general equitable powers, even if he did not meet the specific requirements to establish de facto parentage. VRP (Feb. 24, 2014) at 5. Meanwhile, the Miniums contended that it would be impossible for Mr. Shmilenko to establish de facto parentage because “John and Patti Shmilenko have always referred to themselves, both of them, in their relationship with [M.W.], as grandparent[al] in nature.” <em>Id. </em>at 13. The court ultimately ruled that in light of the preexisting custody decree, a finding of adequate cause was necessary and proceeded to analyze the request for visitation under the four elements needed to establish de facto parentage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
      <em>See id. </em>at 27-28. The court ruled that the threshold requirement for a de facto parent claim—that the natural or legal parent consented to and fostered a parent-like relationship between the child and the moving party—did not apply because M.W.’s biological parents were deceased and “nobody here amounts to a natural or legal parent.” <em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>

Specifically, the court ruled that because M.W. had overnight visits with the Shmilenkos, Mr. Shmilenko had sufficiently established that “ [t] he child and the moving party live together in the same household.” <em>Id. </em>at 27. The court further found that even though the Miniums were M.W.’s primary caregivers, Mr. Shmilenko sufficiently alleged that he was “still assuming aspects of parenthood” and, therefore, established <a id="p810" href="#p810" data-label="810" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*810</a>adequate cause for the requirement that “[t]he moving party assumed obligations of parenthood without expectation of financial compensation.” <em>Id. </em>Finally, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to establish adequate cause to believe that Mr. Shmilenko “has been in a parental role for a length of time sufficient to establish with the child a bonded, dependent relationship parental in nature.” <em>Id. </em>at 28. The court cautioned that it was ruling on adequate cause only, which would allow the de facto parentage action to move forward, but the factual allegations were “obviously still to be tested.” <em>Id. </em>Acknowledging that it was “swimming well away from any established channel markers, legally,” the court stated it would certify the issue for immediate interlocutory appeal. <em>Id.</em>

RCW 26.10-.030 governs the commencement of nonparental custody proceedings and makes no mention of visitation for a third party. Conceding that RCW 26.10.030 refers only to custody, Mr. Shmilenko argues that RCW 26.10.040 “mandates” a broader definition of custody that includes “visitation by noncustodial third parties.” Br. of Resp’t at 10. However, RCW 26.10.040 plainly considers visitation only within the context of custody proceedings. The provision states that “the court <em>shall </em>consider, approve, or make provisions for: (a) [c]hild custody, visitation, <em>and </em>the support of any child entitled to support,” RCW 26.10.040(l)(a) (emphasis added), enumerating visitation as one of the rights and responsibilities that a court is required to address when making a child custody determination. The mere mention of visitation in RCW 26.10.040 does not create an independent right to third-party visitation, and such an interpretation ignores the statute’s plain language. Use of the conjunctive “and” requires that visitation be determined <em>alongside </em>custody. <em>See Tesoro Ref. &amp; Mktg. Co. v. Dep’t of Revenue, </em><a href="/wash-2d/164/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="164 Wash. 2d 310" data-case-ids="3996156" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/164/0310-01">164 Wn.2d 310</a>, 319, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20P.3d%2028" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="190 P.3d 28">190 P.3d 28</a> (2008) (plurality opinion). In other words, RCW 26.10.040 dictates what a court <em>must </em>consider when making a custody determination, not what rights parties <em>may </em>petition for under the statute. Thus, RCW 26.10.040 cannot be reasonably construed to serve as a statutory basis for seeking third-party visitation outside of a custody proceeding.</p>

We sympathize with Mr. Shmilenko’s desire to ensure a continued relationship with his step-grandson, but he is not M.W.’s legal parent, guardian, or custodian. While he may care about his step-grandson very much, the statute, by design, limits the parties who can interfere in such an intimate part of a child’s life.

There is no reason that a person with a relationship with the child or children could not seek to intervene for the purpose of maintaining and deepening that relationship with the child. We cannot ignore the very language of a statute we are interpreting. We interpret statutes as a whole, giving effect to all language used. <em>C.J.C. v.

Majority at 816. Again, the majority ignores the protections of the statute: an interve-nor must be an “interested party,” and visitation must be in the best interests of the child. And once a custody order is entered, an order can be modified only “pursuant to chapter 26.09 RCW,” RCW 26.10.190(1), which allows only minor modifications unless the court finds, “upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior decree or plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree or plan, that a substantial change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or the nonmoving party and that the modification is in the best interest of the child and is necessary to serve the best interests of the child.” RCW 26.09-.260(1).

Mrs. Shmilenko’s motion supports the conclusion that Mr. Shmilenko had good cause to intervene as an interested party. In his own petition, Mr. Shmilenko simply asked for adjudication of his own rights, either through joinder or through consolidation. The trial court clearly believed that Mr. Shmilenko was an appropriate person to join to the custody proceeding—the court said that it would join a separate petition by Mr. Shmilenko to the custody proceeding because that would be “in the interest of justice and of the efficient adjudication of both matters.” CP at 66.</p>

    <p id="b888-4" data-blocks='[["BL_888.4",888,[202,1099,1247,574]]]'>¶66 Further, our plain language interpretation of RCW 26.10.030 and .040 does not expose persons who have been given lawful custody of a child to harassment and oppression through the filing of duplicative and meritless petitions for custody or visitation. As discussed above, the legislature wisely limited third-party custody actions. RCW 26.10.190(1) requires courts to “hear and review petitions for modifications of” residential orders “pursuant to chapter 26.09 RCW’; in such cases—including M.W.’s—RCW 26.09.260 limits the circumstances under which the court may modify an existing residential schedule:</p>
    <blockquote id="b888-5" data-blocks='[["BL_888.5",888,[247,1708,1202,381]]]'>[T]he court shall not modify a prior custody decree or a parenting plan unless it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior decree or plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree or plan, that <em>a substantial change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or the nonmoving paHy </em>and that the modification is in the best interest of the child and is necessary to serve the best interests of the child.</blockquote>

Section .260 adequately restricts modifications to those necessary to ac<a id="p835" href="#p835" data-label="835" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*835</a>commodate a substantial change in circumstances of the child or nonmoving party, which effectively removes any concern about the prospect of duplicative and meritless petitions for custody or visitation. This is in addition to the safeguard of RCW 26.10.030(2), which gives the trial court discretion to grant or deny third-party intervention upon a showing of good cause.</p>
    <p id="b889-4" data-blocks='[["BL_889.5",889,[202,736,1247,746]]]'>¶67 Even further, here, the parties recognize that beginning school constituted a substantial change in M.W.’s circumstances—section 3.2 of the agreed custody order explicitly stated that it would be “appropriate to review the child’s developmental stage and visitation issues at that time” due to M.W.’s enrollment in school. The custody agreement entered in 2010 reserved for later determination M.W.’s visitation schedule for “[a]ge 5 thereafter,” and it probably would have been a practical impossibility to implement the 2010 visitation schedule after M.W. enrolled in school—section 3.1 of the parenting plan specified that M.W. would visit with Mrs. Shmilenko on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.—in other words, during normal school hours.</p>
    <p id="b889-5" data-blocks='[["BL_889.6",889,[197,1505,1251,368]]]'>¶68 Therefore, under an existing custody proceeding, Mr. Shmilenko properly asserted his claim to third-party visitation pursuant to RCW 26.10.030 and .040. Because Mr. Shmilenko has a statutory basis to assert a visitation claim and the trial court found that there was good cause for him to join, I would reverse the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
    <p id="b889-6" data-blocks='[["BL_889.7",889,[250,1896,960,43]]]'>¶69 For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>

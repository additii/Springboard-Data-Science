Two of those convictions stem from a robbery and burglary sentenced in April 2004. CP at 113. Counting these prior convictions separately, the State calculated Williams’s offender score to be five as to trafficking and seven as to residential burglary. Williams did not deny the existence of his prior convictions but debated the accuracy of the State’s calculation. He insisted that his 2004 robbery and burglary convictions count as a single offense, making his offender score four and six, respectively. According to Williams, the 2004 sentencing court found the prior robbery and burglary convictions encompassed the same criminal conduct and therefore the current sentencing court was bound to that determination under RCW 9.94A.525(5)(a)(i). TP (Nov. 16, 2010) at 9. The dispute at sentencing centered on whether the 2004 court had made such a determination, and whether the burglary antimerger statute required the current sentencing court to count the prior convictions separately regardless of any same criminal conduct finding.</p>

In other words, we read the burglary antimerger statute as superseding the same criminal conduct analysis of RCW 9.94A-.589(l)(a). We said this reading was necessary because any other reading would allow criminal defendants to escape punishment on current crimes and would frustrate the purposes of the SRA framework, given that a defendant <a id="p800" href="#p800" data-label="800" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*800</a>generally serves concurrent terms for crimes arising from a single course of criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 781-82.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b842-4" data-blocks='[["BL_842.4",842,[195,492,1252,1142]]]'>¶8 The reasons supporting the decision in <em>Lessley </em>do not apply to the scoring of prior convictions. The burglary antimerger statute by its plain terms applies to the present <em>punishment </em>and <em>prosecution </em>of offenses. When calculating a defendant’s offender score based on prior crimes involving burglary, the goal is not to repunish or reprosecute the defendant for these crimes. Instead, sentencing courts are concerned with the proportionality of a defendant’s punishment in relation to his or her culpability. To calculate a defendant’s culpability, the SRA requires courts to count all prior convictions separately unless they arose from the same criminal conduct. RCW 9.94A.525(5)(a). This statute applies regardless of whether the prior conviction involved a burglary. At the same time, the legislature recognizes that a defendant who recommits a similar offense is more culpable, and provides a framework for increasing a defendant’s offender score based on the specific offense committed. RCW 9.94A.525(10) and (16) set forth instances when the legislature considers a defendant more culpable due to a prior burglary conviction. This framework supports limiting the burglary antimerger statute to current offenses.</p>

It is apparent from the statute’s legislative history that it was enacted to address double jeopardy concerns, not offender score computations. The statute was originally enacted in 1909 as part of Washington’s new Criminal Code. Laws of 1909, ch. 249, at 890. Chapter 249 of the Laws of Washing<a id="p801" href="#p801" data-label="801" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*801</a>ton indicates that “[t]he Criminal Code was taken largely from New York and Minnesota.” <em>Remington &amp; Ballinger’s Revised Code </em>ascribes section 5045 of the Minnesota Code as the inspiration for Washington’s antimerger statute. Rem. &amp; Bal. Code § 2581 (1910). At the time Washington adopted the statute, section 5045 of the Minnesota Code was titled “Crime in building, punished separately.” Former <a href="/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%205045" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="Minn. Stat. § 5045">Minn. Stat. § 5045</a> (1905) (boldface omitted). Notably, Minnesota has since changed this title to “Double jeopardy.” <a href="/citations/?q=1963%20Minn.%20Laws%201222" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="1963 Minn. Laws 1222">1963 Minn. Laws 1222</a> (boldface omitted). This change further supports the conclusion that the burglary antimerger statute was not intended to address the calculation of a defendant’s offender score based on prior convictions. Moreover, the SRA postdates the burglary antimerger statute by 70 years. We find no evidence to suggest the legislature intended the burglary antimerger statute to supersede the SRA’s more recent directive that prior convictions encompassing the same criminal conduct “shall be counted as one offense.” RCW 9.94A.525(5)(a)(i). We hold that the burglary antimerger statute does not obviate the need for a sentencing court to examine whether prior convictions constitute the same criminal conduct under RCW 9.94A.525(5)(a).</p>

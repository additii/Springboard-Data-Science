In <em>Philadelphia II, </em>the “fundamental and overriding purpose” of the initiative was to enact federal legislation that was “simply not within Washington’s power to enact.” <em>Id. </em>at 719-20.

Appellants, who view it as seeking to amend the constitution, focus on the heading “2/3 Constitutional Amendment” and the fact that the sponsors ask that checks in support of the initiative be made out to “2/3 Constitutional Amendment” and refer to their initiative as “2/3 for Taxes Constitutional Amendment.” <em>See </em>www.voterswantmorechoices.com. Appellants also point to the superior court’s finding of fact 21, which stated that the sponsors, not unnamed supporters, “advertised the initiative as an effort to amend the [c]on-stitution.” CP at 133. In this light, although the text of the initiative does not explicitly call for or mandate an amendment, the threat of a $1.4-billion-a-year tax cut<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> is obviously intended to bring pressure on the legislature to exercise its power to propose a constitutional amendment in violation of articles II and XXIII.</p>

They argue that the initiative is nothing more than contingent legislation to reduce taxes, a form of direct legislation within the legislature’s power.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Viewed in this light, the purpose of I-1366 is the enactment of law and not the amendment of the constitution.</p>

Had each claimed purpose been the sole and explicit purpose of I-1366, the outcome would be obvious. If the initiative called only for a reduction in the sales tax, there would be no preelection issues. If it called only for a two-thirds constitutional amendment, it would clearly be outside the scope of the people’s initiative power.

The superior court’s decision hinged on free speech concerns; however, because our determination that appellants have not established a clear right is dispositive of this case, it is unnecessary to answer the question of whether subject matter, substantive, or procedural preelection review of an initiative implicates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or article I, section 5 of our constitution, and we express no opinion on that matter.</p>

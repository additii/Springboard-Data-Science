He denied that the ordinance'of the city, under the authority of which the check was drawn, is unconstitutional and void. He alleged that the appropriation of the money for the purposes indicated was not a loaning of the credit of the city to any corporation, association, institution, or individual, but the money was appropriated and about to be expended in the preservation of the health and to promote the prosperity and improve the morals, comfort and convenience of the inhabitants of the city in behalf oh the sick and afflicted children, and the other benevolent and charitable purposes for which the welfare association, as above indicated, was constituted.

The complaint alleges that the welfare association is “a benevolent organization organized for the purpose of rendering aid to the poor and unfortunate of the city” (Fort Smith).' The answer alleged, and the demurrer admits, and the proof shows, that the welfare association “is not an association, institution, or corporation, but it is a mere committee of officers and charitably disposed citizens who undertake to carry on the work above mentioned in behalf of the sick and afflicted children, wayward girls, and worthy or indigent families who are undernourished and poorly clothed and fed.”</p>

Digest. Judge Cooley says: “The support of paupers and the giving of assistance to those who, by reason of age, infirmity, or disability, are likely to become such, is, by the practice and common consent of civilized countries, a public purpose. The laws not only exempt from taxation the limited means of such persons, but they go further and provide public, funds with which to furnish them retreats where they can be supplied with the necessaries, and, to a reasonable extent, with the comforts of life. Hospitals are also provided where dependent classes can receive medical aid and assistance, and asylums where the deaf, the dumb, and the blind may be supported and taught, and where the insane may be kept from doing or receiving harm, and can have such careful and scientific treatment, with a view to their restoration, as they would not be likely to receive elsewhere. He would be a bold man who, in these days, should question the public right to make provisions for these benevolent objects. And this provision might not only be made by the establishment of institutions for the purpose, but private institutions. might undoubtedly be aided with public funds, in consideration of services to be rendered to the public, and expenses to be incurred by them in assisting and relieving the same necessitous and dependent classes.” Cooley on Taxation, pp. 204-5.</p>

If the building of a city hospital is within the implied powers granted to municipal corporations under the general welfare clause to preserve the health of the inhabitants of the city, then surely the benevolent purposes which the welfare association was organized to perform, and is performing, in the city of Fort Smith come also well within the compass of these powers. For there are no more worthy or higher objects of government to he attained than those of making suitable provision for the care and maintenance of those of the city’s inhabitants who, through unavoidable casualty and misfortune, have become indigent and sick, and who are therefore wholly unable to care for themselves. This includes not only the aged and infirm, but orphans, or babies and poor dependent children whose parents are unable to care for them. In short, it would be difficult to imagine or state a more deserving public purpose or one coming-more within the compass of the true functions of municipal government, than the benevolent objects set forth in the answer and shown by the proof in this record which the welfare association has sponsored and is successfully performing for the inhabitants of the city of Fort Smith.</p>

In <em>Jonesboro </em>v. Montague, <a href="/ark/143/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="143 Ark. 13" data-case-ids="1589510" data-case-paths="/ark/143/0013-01">143 Ark. 13</a>, we said: “"When the powers to be performed by the governing bodv of municipal corporations are of a ministerial, administrative, or executive nature, they may delegate the power to a committee. The business of municipal corporations, 'like other corporations, must be conducted through agents. <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>To segregate a municipal corporation from all other corporations in the methods employed in the transaction of business would prove highly detrimental to all concerned, and if it could not act upon any matter properly before it which also affected the rights of its officers, few competent persons could be induced to accept such offices.” That piinciple applies here. In contributing of its funds to this welfare association or committee to carry on governmental work which otherwise the city would have to perform, or at least should perform through some other agency, it in effect but adopts this welfare association as its own agency to do the character of governmental work which manifestly the city authorities conceived could be better, or at least as well, done as, through some instrumentality which was exclusively- of .its own creation and over which it had suprepae control.</p>

It occurs to us that the fact that private individuals and civic clubs and organizations also contributed to a fund which is used to accomplish the same objects does not make the contribution by the city any the less a contribution toward the legitimate purpose of promoting the general welfare of its inhabitants, and thus performing a governmental function.</p>

The Constitution of 1874 was framed in convention as the organic law of the State of Arkansas hv representatives chosen by the people just after they had been disenthralled from a government which had been foisted upon them by acts of Congress during the period known as the Reconstruction Era, and which government, out of popular derision and contempt for those then in authority, was designated as “the carpetbag government,” because it was dominated for the most part by foreign political adventurers and freebooters who came among us for no other purpose than to exploit the resources of our people for their private gain. During this period the people of the State at large and of many of the counties and municipalities were burdened with oppressive exactions of taxation laid for the purpose of paying bond issues and guarantees of bond issues, of public and g"«&lt;m-public corporations, granted ostensibly in aid of railroad and levee building and other such projects, but which projects in reality were never consummated, and from which the people themselves received no benefit whatever. In other words, there was a saturnalia of bond issues given to companies, associations, corporations, institutions, and individuals, which were conceived, planned, and carried out by those then having the reins of government, not for the public good, but for the private loot and enrichment of those in governmental control. Section 5, article 12, of the Constitution, <em>supra, </em>was intended to forever forestall and prohibit a recurrence of such conditions. It was with this in view that municipal corporations were prohibited from appropriating money or lending their credit to corporations, associations, institutions', or individuals who were either organized for or engaged in purely private enterprises, or who, if organized for or engaged in a public enterprise, or guasi-public enterprise, might exploit or use the public funds or resources of the State’s governmental agencies for private gain. It was never the design of the builders of the framework <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>of our government to prohibit ihunicipalities from carrying on governmental functions of the character indicated in this record through any agency which they might select for those purposes.

      <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>It is argued in the brief of counsel for the appellants that, inasmuch as statutes of the State which apply to the area over which the city of Fort Smith has jurisdiction, and the general statutes of the State, adequately provide ways and means for doing the work of the welfare association other than through the instrumentality of such welfare association, therefore the ordinance under review is invalid because it undertakes to do or to aid in doing the same work through the agency of such association or committee. This argument is manifestly unsound. Because the county, as a governmental agency, may do a part of the same work under general statutes, or the city may do all, or a part of the same work in other or different ways, or through different agencies, is no reason why the city may not adopt the welfare association as the most economical and efficient instrumentality that could be adopted for accomplishing the purposes of municipal government as set forth in this record and authorized by the general welfare clause <em>(§ </em>7494, C. &amp; M.

The Chief Justice and myself are of the opinion that the ordinance appropriating money to the Fort Smith Federated Welfare Association violates art. 12, § 5, of the Constitution of 1874, which reads as follows: “No county, city, town or other municipality corporation shall become a stockholder in ¡any company, association or corporation, or obtain or appropriate money for, or loan its credit to, any corporation, association, institution or individual.”</p>

While the mayor was elected a member of the board of directors, this was done by the voluntary action of the members of the association, and he was not elected pursuant to any law requiring it, nor did he become a director by virtue of his office as mayor. Neither the city nor the State has any control whatever over the association or management of its affairs. The institution owes no duty to the city or to the State. The question is whether the association comes within the prohibition of the Constitution. The same principle would apply as in cases of public and private corporations. Under this provision of the Constitution a municipal tax must be for a public and not a private purpose. Under it, the Legislature has no power to authorize a municipal corporation to make a gift of money raised by taxation to a voluntary association of individuals or an institution organized to carry on private charity, although it may result in incidentally benefiting the public.

The court said that, having the authority, under the Constitution, to commit to the charge of the Shepherd’s Fold the specified class of the poor, it was a matter of legislative discretion to determine how the expenses of these children should be provided for.

In that case there was a statute making it the duty of the county court to commit infant females of a designated class to the industrial school, and charging the county with the expense of their maintenance.

In that case it was said that municipal corporations have only the powers expressly conferred by statute, and such as are necessarily incident to those expressly granted, or essential to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation. Hence we held that, under the section of the statute relating to municipal corporations commonly known as the general welfare clause, the common council of the city had the power to provide by ordinance for the erection 'and maintenance of a public hospital by said city. This statutory provision, in our opinion, has no reference to or connection with private charitable hospitals which have been erected or established in a city by any private corporation, society, or voluntary association.</p>

In that case the court said: “We have carefully examined all the statutes to which we have been referred, and all others in any manner relating to the subjects under consideration, and we have utterly failed to discover any express power, or any by fair implication, by which the appropriations to the appellants, in the manner in which they have been made, can be sustained. They are made without terms or conditions. The institutions could receive the money thus appropriated, and the day after, in the exercise of the powers completely in their control, discharge every inmate received from the city. We speak not of what would likely be done, but of the power to do. The city council, in making these appropriations, entirely abdicate all discretion over the subject of their application. They become therefore mere donations. Who shall or who shall not be the objects of the charity, the .city retains no power to determine. Whether the inmates really belong to the pauper class,- — whether they be really objects of municipal care and protection — are questions that the city authorities do not determine, and have no means -of determining. It is all left to the discretion of -those who manage the institutions, and they, as we -have -shown, are not municipal agents, nor subject to any -control or accountability as to the use and -application of the money. It is certain, we suppose, -that the city council could have no power to make appropriations to these institutions -simply as such, nor because merely of the very humane and laudable -objects and purposes <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>for which, they were created by their founders and promoters; it is only because of the actual services and benefits rendered the city that any claim, could be urged for their support from the city treasury. And, if this is so, what guarantee has the city that services or benefits will accrue, commensurate with -the appropriations that are made? The same principle that would sustain these appropriations would equally sustain appropriations to every private school and private charity in the city.

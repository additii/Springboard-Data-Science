On Kozol’s appeal from the superior court’s denial of his request to present a writ petition, the Court of Appeals held that Kozol could petition for such a writ in challenging a prison disciplinary decision. But because a personal restraint petition is an “adequate remedy at law” for challenging such a decision in this case, Kozol cannot establish a basis for statutory writ. We therefore grant the State’s petition for review and reverse the Court of Appeals.</p>

But Kozol instead filed a pro se action for declaratory relief in Thurston County Superior Court, alleging among other things that the department violated disciplinary hearing procedures set forth in chapter 137-28 WAC.

The court affirmed the dismissal of the declaratory judgment action but reversed denial of Kozol’s motion to amend his complaint to seek a statutory writ of review, holding that Kozol could seek such a writ in challenging a prison disciplinary decision not involving loss of good conduct credits. The court declined to address whether Kozol could seek a constitutional writ. <em>See Malted Mousse, Inc. v.

But the Court of Appeals held that a personal restraint petition is not an adequate remedy in this case because Kozol was not under “restraint” as a result of his prison discipline, reasoning that his sanction of cell confinement did not constitute an “atypical and significant hardship ... in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” <em>Sandin v.

But a personal restraint petitioner is under “restraint” if he is “confined.” RAP 16.4(b). Kozol is an inmate “confined” within a state correctional facility. He is thus under “restraint.” <em>See In re Pers.

RAP 16.4(a).

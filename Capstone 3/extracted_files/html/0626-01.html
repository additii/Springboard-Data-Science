Bartlett of Mound City, 111., made a written contract with W. D. Moore, of Rosey, Ark., for the latter to get out certain elm logs for the former. The contract provided for one barge or more of elm timber to be put out at O’Donnell’s Bend, on the Mississippi River, in Mississippi County, Ark., in reach of a derrick boat. The contract was signed by W. D. Moore for himself and by Charley Dumm for 0. L. Bartlett. Dumm had been purchasing timber for Bartlett for ten years, and, according to their testimony, Dumm had only authority to make written contracts for the purchase of timber for Bartlett. Dumm had purchased timber generally for Bartlett for ten years, and had bought timber whenever he wished. A barge of timber consists of 100,000 feet. The contract in question was executed on the 24th day of July, 1920. Dumm returned in August to see how the work was progressing, and Moore told him that he did not think that he could get out enough timber for one barge, because his timber was not turning out like he thought it would. Dumm asked him if he could 'not buy timber from any one else around there. Moore replied that he could get some from Yoclium and another person. J. R. Yochum was the son-in-law of W. D. Moore. Dumm <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>agreed that Moore might fill out his barge with Yochum’s timber. On August 31,1920, Yochum got J. M. Landrum, a bank cashier, to write the following letter to Bartlett:</p>

D. Moore. On the 3rd of September, 1920, Bartlett wrote to Yochum that he had already advanced $1,000 on the barge that Moore was getting out, and that he did not feel like he could advance any more on any one barge. He stated in the letter that his log man, Charley Dumm, would be in Yochum’s vicinity soon, and that he hoped, that he could make satisfactory arrangements with Yochum and Moore. On the 2nd day of October, 1920, Bartlett sent Moore a check for $800 and told him that he eould not take any more logs from him after the barge he was then loading had been filled. Sometime about the middle of October Dumm came down and accepted the logs which Moore had got out, and this amount was sufficient to fill one barge containing something over 100,000 feet. At the same time Dumm inspected, scaled and accepted the logs which had been put out by the plaintiff Yochum, to the amount of 59,000 feet, and at the time he accepted them he knew that Yochum had got out the logs under the contract with Moore. Dumm at the time told Moore and Yochum that he was going to take the barge containing Moore’s timber up the river and come back and get Yochum’s timber on another barge. W. D. Moore did not call Yochum’s attention to the letter which he had' received from Bartlett dated October 2, 1920, telling him that he would take but one barge of logs from him. The contract price of the logs was $35 <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>per 1,000 feet. According to the testimony of Diimm, he did not know how many feet of timber Yochnm had got out at the time he made the inspection of the timber and accepted it.

It is earnestly insisted by counsel for the defendant that the court should have directed a verdict in his favor. They point out that Dumm only had authority to enter into written contracts for the purchase of timber for the defendant, and that no contract in writing was ever made by him with Yochum. They insist that the only contract made with Yochum for getting out logs was the answer of Bartlett to the letter written by Landrum for Yochum of the date of August 31, 1920.</p>
    <p id="b654-5" data-blocks='[["BL_654.6",654,[259,973,1207,1259]]]'>It is true that the letter only refers to the shortage on Moore’s barge and asked permission to supply enough logs to fill out that barge; but this letter and the answer accepting does not restrict the plaintiff’s right of recovery to that barge. "While Dumm had authority from Bartlett only to make written contracts for the purchase of timber, yet his apparent authority in the matter covered a much wider field. Dumm had been the general purchasing agent for Bartlett for a number of years, and had purchased all of his timber in that part of the country. Bartlett himself wrote to Yochum that Dumm would be down in his vicinity soon, and that he trusted that he could make satisfactory arrangements with Moore and Yochum about their timber. He knew that Yochum was getting out logs for him under the contract which Dumm had made with Moore for him. It was inferable, from these facts and circumstances, that Dumm had at least apparent authority to make an oral contract with Yochum for the purchase of the logs got out by him.

The respective theories of the parties to this lawsuit were submitted to the jury under proper instructions. The jury returned a verdict for Yochum in the sum of $1,665. The undisputed evidence shows that Yochum got out 59,000 feet of timber and placed it on the river bank for Bartlett. Yochum testified in positive terms that he got out this amount by the first of October, 1920. His testimony is corroborated by other facts and circumstances. He was to receive $35 per 1,000 feet for all logs gotten out by him. This would amount to $2,065. 'Bartlett had already made an advancement of $400. This would leave a balance of $1,665, which was the amount of the verdict. This shows that the jury only allowed Yochum for the timber ydiich was scaled and accepted by Dumm on the riyer bank.</p>

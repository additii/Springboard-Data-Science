The doctors testifying for the appellee testified at length, giving their <a id="p676" href="#p676" data-label="676" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*676</a>reasons for their conclusions, and testified that in their opinion he was insane early in 1925.</p>

We have already shown that the guar<a id="p680" href="#p680" data-label="680" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*680</a>dian is not the party, but that the insane person is the real party.</p>
    <p id="b700-3" data-blocks='[["BL_700.4",700,[268,490,1208,449]]]'>In the case of <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Townsend, supra, </em>we said: “If the insanity of a defendant in a pending suit was .suggested, but had not been judicially ascertained, the court gave opportunity for an inquisition to be held, or took the necessary steps to determine the question for itself; and, having ascertained that the defendant was mentally incapable of making his defense, appointed a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for him, and thereafter imposed upon him the restraints of infancy.”</p>
    <p id="b700-4" data-blocks='[["BL_700.5",700,[274,946,1198,245]]]'>In this case, even if the appointment of a guardian had been void, the proper party was the insane person, and it was the duty of the court to proceed with the case permitting the appellee to continue as next friend, or it could have appointed her guardian <em>ad litem.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b700-5" data-blocks='[["BL_700.6",700,[273,1205,1210,297]]]'>The court heard the evidence as to insanity, and knew the condition of Holt’s mind at the time of the-trial; knew he was insane, and it was the court’s duty to proceed with the trial of the case, and not turn the insane person out of court. There was no error therefore in proceeding with the trial as the circuit court did.</p>
    <p id="b700-6" data-blocks='[["BL_700.7",700,[276,1508,1196,185]]]'>The appellant argues that two instructions given by the court at the request of the appellee were erroneous, and that the judgment should be reversed for that reason.</p>
    <p id="b700-7" data-blocks='[["BL_700.8",700,[274,1717,1198,652]]]'>The first instruction objected to reads as follows: “Total disability as used in the policy does not necessarily require or mean that the assured must be absolutely disabled from transacting any kind of work or business, but such a disability is meant which renders him wholly unable to perform or execute the necessary substantial and material things and acts in usual or customary way of any business employment or occupation. But, if the assured was able to perform or execute in the usual or customary way any of the substantial or material things necessary to be done in the prosecution of any business, employment, or occupation whatever, he was then not totally disabled under the law.”</p>

      <a id="p681" href="#p681" data-label="681" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*681</a>Appellant’s specific objection to this instruction was to tbe first paragraph of it, ending with ‘ ‘ occupation, ’ ’ but when tbe entire instruction is read, it is certainly as favorable to tbe appellant as it was entitled to. Moreover, tbe appellant requested, and tbe court gave, tbe following instruction:</p>
    <p id="b701-4" data-blocks='[["BL_701.4",701,[210,715,1198,350]]]'>“Tbe plaintiff is not entitled to recover merely by showing that there was an impairment in tbe ability of R. E. Holt on August 8, 1925, but it is necessary that tbe plaintiff show by a preponderance of tbe evidence that be was disabled to tbe point where be could not perform any of tbe material and substantial duties of a gainful occupation.”</p>
    <p id="b701-5" data-blocks='[["BL_701.5",701,[213,1070,1199,349]]]'>Tbe court also, at tbe request of tbe appellant, gave tbe following instruction: “You are instructed that the fact that R. E. Holt is now totally and permanently disabled does not entitle him to tbe benefits of tbe policy, but tbe burden is upon tbe plaintiff to show by a preponderance of tbe evidence that he was wholly and permanently disabled prior to August 8, 1925.”</p>
    <p id="b701-6" data-blocks='[["BL_701.6",701,[212,1433,1199,246]]]'>Other instructions were given at tbe request of tbe appellee, and also others at tbe request of tbe appellants, but no objections are urged to them. "We think, when tbe instructions on tbe question of permanent and total disability are read together, they correctly state tbe law.</p>
    <p id="b701-7" data-blocks='[["BL_701.7",701,[216,1685,1197,239]]]'>It is also contended that tbe court erred in not sustaining appellant’s objection to the hypothetical question propounded to mental experts. However, we do not find that this question is mentioned in appellant’s motion for a new trial.</p>

We have seen that tbe statute does not permit even tbe father <a id="p682" href="#p682" data-label="682" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*682</a>or mother of an infant to take charge of his estate without first giving bond as guardian of the infant. There is nothing in the statute that confers such authority upon the next friend of an infant, and we are of opinion that he has no such authority.” <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Claiborne, </em><a href="/ark/82/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="82 Ark. 514" data-case-ids="1529033" data-case-paths="/ark/82/0514-01">82 Ark. 514</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20S.W.%20219" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="102 S.W. 219">102 S.

    <p id="b702-3" data-blocks='[["BL_702.4",702,[257,858,1200,351]]]'>It is contended by appellants that the verdict is excessive. It is undisputed that on November 10, 1924, R. E. Holt- borrowed the sum of $160 on the policy as security, and that this loan has never been repaid. This indebtedness of $160 should be deducted from the judgment for $3,000. The judgment will be modified by deducting $160 and, as modified, affirmed.</p>

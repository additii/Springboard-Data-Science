They took it out for a test drive, and Owens told the salesman he restored and worked on VWs and had a VW tattoo on his back. They left without purchasing the car or leaving their names. The next day, Saturday, July 3, 2010, the salesman opened the dealership and discovered that the back gate to the car lot was open and the padlock securing it had been cut off. The same 1967 VW Beetle that Owens test drove the day before had been stolen off the lot, and one of the dealer’s keys was missing.</p>

On July 28, 2010, in response to a Craigslist advertisement posted by Owens, Craig Sauvageau purchased the 1971 VW Beetle from Owens. Claiming he had lost the title, Owens provided Sauvageau with an affidavit in lieu of title. Sauvageau took the car to an auto shop to have it inspected and worked on. The mechanic discovered that parts for a 1971 VW Beetle did not fit in the car and that a vehicle identification number (VIN) plate on the car (matching the VTN for the 1971 Beetle registered by Owens on July 6) appeared to be brand new and recently reinstalled with rivets. The mechanic informed Sauvageau of these discrepancies, and Sauvageau called the police to report the car as potentially stolen.</p>

This confidential VIN did not match the newly installed VTN plate, but it did match the VTN for the 1967 VW Beetle reported stolen from Motor City on July 3, 2010. The vehicle was returned to Motor City, and Motor City employees noted that it was missing the roof rack and surfboard; was painted a different color; and had a different, more inferior engine than the original high-performance engine. Sauvageau was able to identify Owens from a picture lineup, and the police <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>confirmed that Owens had a VW tattoo on his back. An officer drove by Owens’s residence and observed a yellow VW Beetle with a roof rack. Another officer located another Craigslist post by Owens advertising a yellow “Baja” style VW Beetle with a high-performance engine of the same model as the high-performance engine in the stolen 1967 VW Beetle. This officer contacted Owens, posing as a potential buyer for the yellow Beetle, and set up a meeting to see the car at Owens’s residence.

The jury convicted Owens of trafficking in stolen property, possession of a stolen vehicle, and bail jumping but acquitted him of taking a motor vehicle without permission. On appeal, Division One affirmed the possession and bail jumping convictions but held that there was insufficient evidence to support at least one of the means by which Owens could have committed trafficking in stolen property.

    <p id="b160-5" data-blocks='[["BL_160.6",160,[218,617,1248,542]]]'> ¶8 The first issue is whether RCW 9A.82.050 is an alternative means crime and, if so, what those alternative means are. This presents an issue of statutory interpretation. Generally, an alternative means crime is one by which the criminal conduct may be proved in a variety of ways. The legislature has not defined what constitutes an alternative means crime or designated which crimes are alternative means crimes. We have determined that each case must be determined on its own merits, but our few cases on the subject have established some guiding principles.</p>
    <p id="b160-6" data-blocks='[["BL_160.7",160,[220,1180,1248,479]]]'>¶9 One guiding principle is that the use of a disjunctive “or” in a list of methods of committing the crime does not necessarily create alternative means of committing the crime. <em>State v.

In <em>Peterson, </em>for example, the defendant was convicted for failing to register as a sex offender.

For example, it would be hard to imagine a single act of stealing whereby a person “organizes” the theft but does not “plan” it. Likewise, it would be difficult to imagine a situation whereby a person “directs” the theft but does not “manage” it. Any one act of stealing often involves more than one of these terms. Thus, these terms are merely different ways of committing one act, specifically stealing. Consistent with <em>Peterson, </em>where the various acts of moving without giving proper notice were too similar to constitute distinct alternative means, an individual’s conduct under RCW 9A.82.050(1) does not vary significantly between the seven terms listed in the first clause, but does vary significantly between the two clauses.

He argues, though, that even if there are only two alternative means of trafficking in stolen property, insufficient evidence supports the alternative that he facilitated or participated in the <em>theft </em>in one of the seven ways listed in the first clause of the statute.</p>

We disagree. The statute does not require that the defendant personally steal the car. An individual can still participate in or facilitate the theft of property without actually being the individual who physically took it. Owens also argued at oral argument that there was insufficient evidence to support the first means because all of the seven words listed require the participation of another person and there was no proof that anyone else other than Owens initiated, organized, planned, financed, directed, managed, or supervised the theft of the car.</p>

Under the statute, a single person can “plan” or “initiate” under the plain meaning of those words. Owens told investigators that he had purchased the car from another individual after responding to a Craigslist ad. But he could provide no details or documentation from the sale. The claimed circumstances of Owens acquiring the only car that was stolen off of Motor City’s lot on July 3, 2010, with no real explanation of how he did so, removing the roof rack and surfboard, replacing the high-performance engine with a different engine, repainting the car, and reregistering the car under a different year in such a short period of time is sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that he initiated or participated in the theft of the car for sale to others. Thus, viewing the case in the light most favorable to the State, sufficient evidence exists to support the alternative means that he knowingly initiated, <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>organized, planned, financed, directed, managed, or supervised the theft of property for sale to others.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

In closing, the prosecutor stated that with regard to the trafficking charge, there were “three separate elements [he had] to prove.” Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Aug. 10, 2011) at 21. As a result, the State ultimately had to prove (and the jury had to find) that Owens both participated in the theft of the car for sale to others and was trafficking the car. Thus, regardless of how the statute is interpreted, the jury in this case was ultimately not instructed on an alternative means crime, and we can infer jury unanimity as to the means by which Owens committed the crime as there were no other alternatives, but rather elements of the crime. Because there is sufficient evidence supporting each element of the charged crime in this case, as discussed above, there is evidence to support the jury’s verdict and the conviction would still stand.</p>

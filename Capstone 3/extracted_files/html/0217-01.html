The judgment of conviction was, on appeal, affirmed by this court. <em>Sease </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/155/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="155 Ark. 130" data-case-ids="1360554" data-case-paths="/ark/155/0130-01">155 Ark. 130</a>. After the judgment of affirmance by this court the date of the execution was fixed by executive proclamation, and on December 12 the petitioner, through his counsel, presented to the judge of the circuit court in vacation a petition for a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>for the purpose of inquiring Into appellant’s sanity at the time of his trial and conviction. Numerous affidavits were presented to the circuit judge in support of the petition, but upon examination thereof he refused to issue the writ. The record made be<a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>fore the judge in vacation has been brought here on certiorari for review.</p>
    <p id="b241-3" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[127,480,1200,415]]]'>The case is, we think, ruled by the principles announced by this court in the recent case of <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/156/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="156 Ark. 188" data-case-ids="1358497" data-case-paths="/ark/156/0188-01">156 Ark. 188</a>. We decided in the case just cited that, where the question of the -insanity of the accused was suggested, either formally or informally, at or before the trial, the writ of error <em>coram nobis was </em>not available after conviction to raise that question for the purpose of setting aside the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b241-4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[127,904,1200,569]]]'>The testimony offered in support of this writ was merely cumulative of the testimony that was offered in the trial and tended to show general insanity dating back prior to the day of the homicide. The accused, at the trial, asked for a continuance of the cause on the ground that he was insane, and the refusal of the court to grant the continuance was one of the assignments, of error on the appeal to this court. If the trial court erred in failing to suspend the trial on account of the alleged insanity of appellant, it was an error which could only be corrected by appeal. .</p>
    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.6",241,[126,1480,1200,247]]]'>The petition now before us is sufficiently broad, however, to constitute an allegation of insanity at the present time and to invoke relief by suspension of the sentence as long as the condition of insanity of the accused exists.</p>

This remedy, however, as shown in the Kelley case, <em>supra, </em>must be exercised with caution, and the court determines, as a preliminary question, whether there is sufficient ground for entering upon an investigation of the question of the insanity of the convict. As we have already said, the testimony, now adduced is merely cumulative of that which was adduced at the trial, and tends only to show general insanity, which began long before the commission of the homicide. It is true <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>there were introduced the affidavits of physicians who testified as experts, but that testimony is merely cumulative. There was no showing of a substantial change in petitioner’s condition since the original trial.</p>
    <p id="b242-3" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[346,597,1197,203]]]'>We are of the opinion that the circuit judge was justified, under the circumstances, in refusing to grant the writ. The writ of certiorari is therefore quashed, and the judgment of the circuit judge in vacation is affirmed.</p>

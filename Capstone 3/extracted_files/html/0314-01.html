' Appellants shipped the cotton by rail from Okemah, Oklahoma, to Fort Smith, consigned to themselves, and mailed to appellees a draft for the price, according to gin weights, with bills of lading attached. The shipment was diverted from Fort <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>Smith to Van Burén on account of the embargo at Fort Smith, but the testimony introduced in the present litigation establishes the fact that this diversion was not made by the carrier at the instigation either of the appellees or appellants. Appellees paid the draft and took up the bills of lading, and caused the cotton to be weighed at the compress at Van Burén. According to these weights there was a loss in the weight of the- cotton sufficient to amount to the sum of $683.18 at the purchase price paid for the cotton, -and appellees instituted this action in the -circuit court of Sebastian County (Fort Smith District) to recover this amount.</p>

There is very little, if any, material conflict in the testimony concerning the contract between the parties and its effect. Appellees were engaged in the cotton business in Muskogee, Oklahoma, and appellants were engaged in the same business at Okemah, Oklahoma, and during the month of January, 1920, the parties entered into an agreement for the sale of two hundred bales of cotton by appellants to appellees at the price of thirty-nine cents per pound, the price to be paid according to gin weights, subject, to final adjustment in accordance with compress weights after shipment and delivery to appellees. It was agreed that the cotton should be shipped by rail to Fort Smith, consigned to appellants’ order, with draft on appellees attached to the bills of lading. There is a slight difference in the statements of the parties as to the precise words of the agreement, but little difference as to the effect. Mr. Vann, one of the appellees, who conducted the negotiations with appellants, testified that there was an embargo on compresses in that locality, except at Fort Smith and Van Burén, and that he expressed a willingness to have the cotton shipped to either place, but that appellants claimed that they had had trouble with weig’hts at the Van Burén compress, and preferred to ship to Fort Smith, to which he readily agreed. Mr. Barry, one of the appellants, testified that he objected to shipping to Van Burén, and declined to do so on account of having had trouble with the compress weights at that place, and that he insisted on shipping the cotton to Fort Smith, to which Mr. Vann agreed.</p>

    <blockquote id="b347-8" data-blocks='[["BL_347.7",347,[220,1399,1210,868]]]'>“3.

The undisputed evidence gs that the cotton was to be shipped to appellants’ own order at Fort Smith, and delivered there to appellees, upon payment of the draft attached to the bills of lading. That instruction was also erroneous, as will be seen in the discussion of the other instructions hereafter, in denying appellees recovery on account of loss in weights merely because the cotton was not weighed in Fort Smith.</p>

According to the undisputed evidence, shipment was made to appellants’ own order, and, nothing else being proved to manifest the contrary intention of the parties, this constituted a reservation of the title, and the delivery to the carrier was not a delivery to the purchaser. In a recent case we said that “where the seller consigns the shipment to his own order, thus.manifesting his intention to reserve his dominion and right of disposition over the property, nothing else appearing to manifest an intention to pass the title, such consignment does not constitute a delivery to the purchaser.” <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Fowler Commission Co., </em><a href="/ark/154/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="154 Ark. 92" data-case-ids="1361202" data-case-paths="/ark/154/0092-01">154 Ark. 92</a>, and cases there cited. Appellants having reserved their dominion and control over the cotton by consigning it to their own order at Fort Smith, made the carrier their own agent, and they alone are responsible for the unauthorized diversion. Appellees were therefore not bound by the agreement to settle according to the Fort Smith weights, unless appellants gave an opportunity to ,carry out that agreement by re-weighing the cotton at Fort Smith. There is no 'contention that appellants gave an opportunity to re-weigh the cotton at Fort Smith, and they could not, therefore, escape liability for loss in weights <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>merely because the carrier, as their agent, had diverted the cotton to another place. The agreement was, as before stated, to make final settlement upon the compress weights at Fort Smith. The agreement was that the cotton was to be shipped to Fort Smith, and that the compress weights were to be the basis of final settlement, and this necessarily meant the compress at Fort Smith. There was no agreement that the parties should be bound by the compress weights at Van Burén, or at any place other than Fort Smith, but, since the cotton was not delivered to the compress in Fort Smith, appellees were entitled to recover for actual losses in weight. The parties were not bound by the compress weights at Van Burén unless they were correct weights, and the burden of proof was on appellees to show that those weights were correct.</p>

As we have already said, the burden was on appellees to prove the actual weight of the cotton, as the parties had not agreed to be bound by the Van Burén compress weights, and were not bound. But the instruction was too favorable to appellants in telling the jury that, if there was an agreed place for the re-weighing of the cotton, the burden would be upon appellees to show what the weights would have been if it had been re-weighed there. Appellees were not bound to cause the cotton to be weighed at the agreed place, after it had been diverted by the carrier, without their consent, therefore they were not bound to show what the weights would be at that place before they could recover. They had the right to ascertain the actual weights, and were entitled to recover on that basis. Appellees introduced the Van Burén compress weights, and proved that they were correct, and the recovery is authorized, based on these weights, not because there was any agreement to be bound thereby, but because the weights were founl by the jury to be correct.</p>

The answer to this contention is that appellants themselves attached the reputation of the weigher at Van Burén, and this invited the introduction of the testimony on that subject.

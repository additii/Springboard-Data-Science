In overruling this contention we there said: ‘ ‘ The two sections of the statute exist as separate and distinct legislative enactments. The later act in no manner attempts to amend or change the existing requirements as to the removal of the disabilities of minors. It simply confers the power upon the chancery courts to remove their disabilities, and pro<a id="p711" href="#p711" data-label="711" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*711</a>vides that it shall be done under an existing statute as to the' procedure. In other words, it confers upon the chancery court the power to remove the disabilities of minors, and provides the same procedure in executing the power as already existed in the case of circuit courts.

W. (2d) 389</a>. There a question arose between the owner of the remainder and the owner of a lesser estate as to liability for the annual assessments due upon the property thus owned in an improvement district. We there held that the equitable distribution of the burden of paying the annual assessments requires the. life tenant to discharge these assessments during each year of his occupancy. Yet, the entire fee would have been sold had this burden not been discharged, for the reason that the assessments were a lien upon the fee. But, as between the owners of the two estates, it was the duty of the occupant to pay installments maturing during his occupancy. So here the remainderman may require the. owner of the lesser estate, as between themselves, to discharge rates maturing during the continuance of his estate, but, if neither pays these charges, the entire -estate may be sold, for the reason that the entire estate, has the benefit conferred upon the land by the sewer system. •</p>

W. (2d) 32</a>, a waterworks improvement district found it necessary to expend large sums of money, which it did not have on hand, for engines and replacement expenses. A property owner in the district sought to prevent this action, upon the ground that the district could only incur such an obligation after having been authorized so to do upon the petition of property owners. Under the terms of the contract for the purchases required by the district, it was provided that the purchase price was payable only out of the savings in the cost of pumping the water ‘ ‘ and shall never be held to create any liability or general obligation upon the said district, and no taxes, general or special, shall ever be levied upon the real estate or other property in said district or hereafter within the district, to pay all or any part of said sum of $23,560 or any interest thereon.” In holding against the contention of the protesting property owner that the district was without power to incur the obligation, we there said: “ ‘It is, in effect, a cash transaction, where the payments are to be made <em>pari passu </em>with the accumulation of the fund, and the only fund, out of which they are to come.’ <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Town of Bedham, </em><a href="/mass/144/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="144 Mass. 177" data-case-ids="774147" data-case-paths="/mass/144/0177-01">144 Mass. 177</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20N.E.%20782" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="10 N.E. 782">10 N.

The courts have held, however, that contracts of this <a id="p716" href="#p716" data-label="716" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*716</a>character did not create debts within the purview of constitutional or statutory prohibitions against incurring debts as the only recourse in the contract which the selling company has in the case of the failure to pay the purchase price is to retake the machinery. It is a contingent liability only, for which a general tax cannot be levied, and does not constitute a lien upon the power plant, nor its revenues. It can be paid only on the contingency that the district derives enough net revenues from the consumers of water and lights furnished by the plant to pay such notes after payment of all expenses of operation, and, as said in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Fayette, </em><a href="/mo/325/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="325 Mo. 75" data-case-ids="1804684" data-case-paths="/mo/325/0075-01">325 Mo. 75</a>, <a href="/mo/325/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="325 Mo. 75" data-case-ids="1804684" data-case-paths="/mo/325/0075-01">28 S.

In this application the insured acknowledged the forfeiture of all claims under the original policy by reason of the lapse of same, and that, as an inducement to the company to reinstate, it was represented that the statements and answers contained in the original application were true when made and were true on the date of the application for reinstatement, and agreed that the same should be based exclusively upon the representations contained in that application and the original application for the policy, and under the condition that, if the statements, or any of them, should be untrue, the company should be under no liability by reason of the attempted reinstatement of the policy except for a return of the premiums paid since the date of the reinstatement; that the answers to the questions regarding the health of the insured and her consultation of a physician since the date of the original application were false, and, because of such false statements, there was no liability except for a return of the premiums which had been tendered.</p>
    <p id="b906-4" data-blocks='[["BL_906.5",906,[281,1748,1204,606]]]'>The next defense interposed was that when the annual premium matured on November 6, 1932, its payment being necessary to carry the policy over another year, the same was not paid, and that the insured and the company entered into an extension agreement, extending the time of payment to May 6, 1933, by which extension agreement it was provided that, if the premium as extended was not paid at maturity, the policy should become null and void, and that, because Guy P. Hamilton, the appellee, jointly executed the same and did not pay, or offer to pay, the premium on the date of maturity, the policy became void.</p>

This physician stated that he had known Maggie Hamilton for about three years, during which time she walked from her home to visit the sick and waited on them, and that the only indication he saw of any infirmity was that when she would step on something sharp, she would give in her foot; that during this time he would have passed her as an insurable risk.</p>

W. 673</a>. In the first-named case the statement of facts does not disclose the date of the issuance of the policy. It lapsed for a failure to pay the premium on October 3, 1921, and was reinstated by the insurer, after the days of grace had expired, on an application which admittedly contained false statements material to the risk. The insured died prior to February 27, 1922, since the proof, of death was made on that date. The beneficiary brought suit to recover, relying on a statute of the State of South Carolina, the applicable portion of which is as follows: “All life insurance companies that shall receive the premium on any policy, for the space of two years- shall be deemed and taken to have waived any right they may have had to dispute the truth of the application for insurance; that the assured person had made false representations, and the said application shall be deemed and taken to be true. ’ ’ The original contract of insurance is not set out, but the court sustained the defense interposed by the insurer that the policy was invalid because of the false statements and, in overruling the contention of the beneficiary, held that the statute relied on referred only to the application made for the issuance of the policy, and had no reference to applications made for reinstatement of policies where the same had lapsed for failure to pay the premiums. The policy appears to have contained an “incontestable clause,” and in disposing of this, the. court said: ‘ <em>‘ </em>The incontestable clause in the policy is not in the case, and we can base no binding judgment thereon.”</p>
    <p id="b908-4" data-blocks='[["BL_908.5",908,[291,2313,1191,97]],["BL_909.1",909,[192,345,1202,806]]]'>In the case at bar it is the contention of the appellee that the defense of falsity of statements in the applica<a id="p891" href="#p891" data-label="891" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*891</a>tion for reinstatement cannot avail the insurer because of a clause in the original policy which provides as follows: “After this policy shall have been in force two full years during the. lifetime of the insured, it shall be incontestable except for nonpayment of premiums. ’ ’ The appellee takes the position that this provision inures to his benefit, although the policy was revived by reinstatement, the application for which contained untrue statements; first, because to avoid the policy for these would be to attach a condition to the right of reinstatement not provided in the original contract; second, that, even if this condition had been authorized, more than two years had elapsed between the date of reinstatement and the death of the insured which would make the incontestable clause effective; and, third, that the false statements were not material to the risk.</p>
    <p id="b909-4" data-blocks='[["BL_909.4",909,[194,1175,1205,1121]]]'>Whether or not a clause, in insurance policies renders the contract incontestable from the date of the issuance of the policy is a question of sharp conflict of authority on the subject. Some respectable courts hold that such contract is invalid on the theory that, if it was procured by fraud, it is no contract, and can never become such if the misrepresentations were of a material nature calculated to deceive and made with that intent. Other courts of equal repute hold to the contrary, basing their conclusions on the ground that the clause was written by the insurer in its own terms for the purpose of inducing the public to enter into contracts with it upon the assurance that, after the insurer had accepted the risk, the validity of the contract will not be questioned. The insurer had all the time it desired to investigate the risk before accepting it and should, and likely does, anticipate that deceit might be practiced by applicants for insurance, and, through its own processes, has means to discover if such deceit has been practiced, and, having announced its satisfaction to bind itself, no subsequently discovered circumstance should avoid the policy except the nonpayment of premiums.</p>

But where, as in the instant case, the agreement not to contest the validity of the policy is postponed for a reasonable and definite period within which time the insurer has the opportunity to ascertain the truth of the representations made, it seems that the provision relating to incontestability is universally held to be valid. Here, more than two years had elapsed between the date of the issuance of the policy and its laps.e for the nonpayment of premiums ; also, more than two years had elapsed from the date of the reinstatement to the date of the death of the insured. From this the question is presented, does the application for reinstatement which contains false statements annul the provision in the policy against incontestability? We hold it does not.</p>

As is held in the <a id="p893" href="#p893" data-label="893" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*893</a>Arkansas cases cited, the company had no right to enlarge the terms upon which reinstatement conld be obtained. It had the right to defer its action on the application for reinstatement for a reasonable time in which it might investigate the insurability of the applicant, and there was no requirement in the original contract that the answers to the questions in the application for reinstatement should be true, and a condition precedent to the reinstatement of the policy and to its validity when so reinstated. In this particular the contract differs from that in the ease of <em>Woodmen, etc., </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>cited and relied upon by the appellant. In that case the insurer was a fraternal order insuring its members. Its bylaws were made a part of the original contract of insurance, one section of which provided for reinstatement of a suspended member upon satisfactory answers being given by him in his application relative to his use of intoxicants, narcotics, and his health at the time of application. It provided, in effect, that, if any of the statements made by the applicant were untrue, reinstatement should be unavailing and he was required to furnish the statements “as a condition precedent to reinstatement and waiving all rights thereto if the said written statements shall be found to be untrue.</p>

In the Leeper case, <em>supra, </em>it was the contention that by reason of lapse, the. original policy was void and the reinstatement created a new contract. In the original policy there was a provision that where the insured committed suicide the- policy should be void, but another clause provided that the policy should be incontestable after two years from the date of its issuance. The policy lapsed after two years had expired and was reinstated, and in the application for reinstatement there was a stipulation that, in the event of self-destruction within one year from the date of approval of the application for reinstatement, the amount payable as a death benefit should be equal only to two annual premiums on said policy, and no more. <a id="p894" href="#p894" data-label="894" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*894</a>The court, under the rule announced in the Adams case, <em>supra, </em>held that this stipulation was an enlargement of the original contract of the terms upon which reinstatement could be obtained, that there was no new contract created by the reinstatement, but a revival and continuance of the original, and that, although it appeared that Leeper had committed suicide within one year from the date of the reinstatement, the incontestable clause in the original policy was applicable, and the fact that he was a suicide was no defense.</p>

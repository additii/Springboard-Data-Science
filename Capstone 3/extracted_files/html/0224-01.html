It therefore appears that, at the time of the forfeiture and sale for taxes, neither the appellant nor the improvement district had any claim against this land,” after a careful analysis, is merely dictum, and ivas not necessary to the conclusion reached. On the contrary, we understand the law to he that an improvement district, holding assessments of benefits against lands within the boundaries of its district, is an interested party in contemplation of law, which can bring in question the invalidity of any tax sale or forfeiture, and this is true, even though the yearly assessment of benefits is not due. The position of an improvement district is analogous to that of a mortgagee of real property. It is uniformly held that a mortgagee of real property may do any act or perform any duty in reference to the protection of title or redemption from sales that can be done or performed by the owner. For this rule to have full application, it is not necessary that the debt secured by the mortgagee be due, or any part thereof, because the status of the parties is established by the execution and delivery of the mortgage. Since we have reached the conclusion that the judicial sale of the property in controversy to Sewer Improvement District No. 1 is a valid sale, it necessarily follows that the decree of the trial court dismissing appellant mortgagees’ complaint for want of equity must be affirmed.</p>

The question can be and is raised, however, by a citizen and taxpayer of the district, who intervened in said cause, and we now proceed to determine it. The first insistence on this question is that the sale to Mrs. Douglas was for an insufficient and inadequate consideration. Improvement districts are not engaged in the real estate business. Their <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>paramount duty is to collect assessments of benefits and' remit the proceeds to the bondholders.

The net result of the majority opinion is that for a consideration of $58.66 the wife of the attorney for the improvement district has acquired property which the undisputed testimony shows has — even now — -notwithstanding the depression, a market value, of not less than $6,000' cash.

The Bankers’ Mortgage Company made a cash loan of $5,000, and the appellants, who are the trustees of the Missouri Congregational Conference, thought the property safe security for a loan of that amount, and upon that assumption took an assignment of the mortgage as an investment for $5,000 of the fund held in trust for the support of indigent preachers of that denomination.

The facts in that case were that, through the failure of certain landowners in an improvement district to pay their annual assessments of benefits, the district had made default in the payment of its maturing obligations, and it became necessary to levy an increased per cent, of the betterments assessed against all the property, including that of lands owned by persons who were not in default. The owners who had paid their assessments complained that, had other owners paid theirs, no increase would have been required in the assessments ; and it was complained also that is was unfair to increase the burdens of persons who had paid their assessments because of the delinquency of others who had made default in that respect. This objection was answered in a statement declaring the duty of the commissioners of the district. This statement, from which the majority have quoted only a single sentence, reads as follows:</p>

Nor is there any dislocation or destruction of the scheme of uniformity by reason of the purchase, by the district of delinquent lands. By the purchase of lands at foreclosure sale,, when the sales are confirmed, the district becomes the absolute owner of the lands, which renders, not only the estimated benefits, but the total value of the lands subject to sale to raise revenues. It would be a contradiction in terms to say that the. foreclosed lands escape their just proportion of the burden by becoming the property of the district, when, as a matter of fact, by this change in the title the lands become wholly subject to these, burdens.</blockquote>

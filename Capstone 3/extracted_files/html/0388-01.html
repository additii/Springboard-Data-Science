The plaintiff in this case sued the city of Belling-<a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>ham for negligence following an injury he sustained when he was thrown from his bicycle after hitting an obstacle in a city-maintained park. Under the statute, landowners who open their property for recreational use free of charge are immune from liability when visitors injure themselves. This statutory immunity does not apply, however, “for injuries sustained to users by reason of a known dangerous artificial latent condition for which warning signs have not been conspicuously posted.” RCW 4.24.210(4)(a). The trial court dismissed the plaintiff’s claims on summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. As we held in <em>Van Dinter v. City of Kennewick, </em><a href="/wash-2d/121/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="121 Wash. 2d 38" data-case-ids="1365847" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/121/0038-01">121 Wn.2d 38</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=846%20P.2d%20522" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="846 P.2d 522">846 P.2d 522</a> (1993), and we hold again today, the adjectives “known,” “dangerous,” “artificial,” and “latent” each modify the term “condition,” not one another. We hold that the Court of Appeals erroneously interpreted the statute by concluding that the plaintiff must show the city of Bellingham <em>knew </em>the condition was <em>dangerous. </em>However, our review of the record supports the trial court’s conclusion that the condition in this case was obvious — that is, not latent. We affirm summary judgment in favor of the city of Bellingham.</p>

Jewels rode over a speed bump that caused a jolt to his bicycle. As he approached a second speed bump, he attempted to ride around it in order to avoid another jolt. Both speed bumps were painted bright yellow and did not span the entire width of the pathway: there was an unpainted section between the speed bump and the adjacent curb. In his declaration, Jewels asserted that the area between the second speed bump and the curb appeared to him to be “bare, flat pavement.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 92. Unfortunately, this area was not bare, flat pavement. Instead, the City had installed an unpainted asphalt berm <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>between the second speed bump and the adjacent right-hand curb. This “water diverter” berm channels water off of the pathway and into a cutout in the right-hand curb. The water diverter is approximately two inches high. In its shape and position, the water diverter is essentially a smaller, lower speed bump that extends from the speed bump proper to the curb cutout.</p>

The unexpected shock from hitting the water diverter forced his front tire into the curb cutout, throwing him from his bicycle and causing him injury. The day after Jewels’s accident, the City’s parks and recreation department issued a work order directing the water diverter to be painted the same yellow color as the speed bump.</p>

The City, in turn, asserted the immunity provided to it under Washington’s recreational land use statute and moved for summary judgment. Jewels countered, arguing that his claim fell within the statutory exception for injuries caused by “a known dangerous artificial latent condition.” RCW 4.24.210(4)(a). He argued that the City knew about the water diverter (having installed it) and that the water diverter was dangerous, man made, and difficult to see. Jewels introduced declarations from himself and other bicycling experts in support of his argument that areas next to speed bumps are usually flat. The City introduced several photographs of the area where the accident occurred. These photographs were taken after the accident and after the water diverter had been painted bright yellow to match the speed bump.</p>

However, the statute creates an exception where an injured party may overcome this immunity by showing either “(1) a fee for the use of the land [was] charged; (2) the injuries were intentionally inflicted; or (3) the injuries were sustained by reason of a known dangerous artificial latent condition for which no warning signs were posted.” <em>Davis, </em>144 Wn.2d at 616 (citing RCW 4.24.210(1), (3)).

From our review of the photographs in the record, we conclude that any person could stand near the water diverter and see it. This water diverter, which is in essence a smaller speed bump, approximately two inches in height, is about an inch lower <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>than the speed bump proper. Even if we were to define the condition as the speed bump in proximity to the cutout and the water diverter, each component of the condition is obvious. If each component of the condition is obvious, so is the condition itself. We note that the City was able to walk up to the area and photograph it without any need to unclose or úncover the condition. Like <em>Swinehart, </em>the fact that the condition can be easily photographed is an acknowledgment that the condition is obvious. Although we agree with the trial court that by later painting the water diverter the City made the condition <em>more </em>obvious, that does not mean that the condition was latent before.

The Couch declaration stated that Couch has “ridden all over the state of Washington through [his] many years as a competitive and recreational cyclist, and as a group ride leader,” and that in his opinion “[s]peed bumps are usually marked by warnings on the roadway such as yellow paint... to give people notice [and] most... do not take up the entire roadway.” CP at 108. Citing a study from San Jose, California, Stevens reported that obstructions like the water diverter— “abrupt . . . [b]umps,” as opposed to “gradual . . . humps”— have been shown to be “particularly extra hazardous for bicycle traffic.” CP at 80-81. Stevens also opined that “[t]he City of Bellingham installed an extra hazardous drainage feature across the Cornwall Park Road[, which] was known to cause loss of control for bicycles [and] light motorcycles, and was also recognized by the industry to cause operational problems for emergency vehicles.” CP at 81.</p>

The City is correct that the report was not attached to a declaration, by Stevens, attesting to the truth of its contents. And it is true that unauthenticated <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>evidence is inadmissible in opposition of summary judgment. <em>SentinelC3, Inc. v.

But the City did not object to the admission of Stevens’ report on that basis in the trial court. Instead, it objected that the report was irrelevant because it was “based on the alleged standards for speed bumps in a city street [, while] . . . the alleged accident occurred on a park access road which is not a platted, designed City of Bellingham street.” CP at 117. Because the City did not object that the report was unsworn, Jewels was afforded no opportunity to correct the error. I would therefore decline to address this unpreserved error now. <em>See </em>RAP 2.5.</p>
    <p id="b460-4" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[207,1022,1247,266]]]'>¶39 The City also argues that Couch’s declaration is inadmissible under Rules of Evidence (ER) 702 because “it offers testimony on areas outside [Couch’s] expertise (park construction) and speculates on why Plaintiff made certain decisions.” City of Bellingham’s Suppl.

    <p id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.5",460,[207,1310,1247,1068]]]'>¶40 This, however, is not an accurate characterization. In his declaration, Couch states that “[s]peed bumps are usually marked by warnings on the roadway such as yellow paint and/or through signage to give people notice.” CP at 108. The basis for that observation is Couch’s 30 years “in bicycle riding and coaching,” CP at 107 — experience sufficient to qualify him as an expert in the kinds of speed bumps that bicyclists typically encounter. <em>See </em>ER 702 (witness may be “qualified as an expert by ... experience”). Couch also opined that “it was reasonable for Mr. Jewels to believe that [the site of the accident] was a typical speed bump, particularly when the first speed bump he came to in the park fit that common pattern.” CP at 109. This was not, as the City asserts, “speculation]” about Jewels’ decision to ride over the water diverter. City of Bellingham’s Suppl. Br. at 20. Rather, it was an opinion about what bicyclists generally do and expect. As such, it was admissible under ER 702. <em>See State v.

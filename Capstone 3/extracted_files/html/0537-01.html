Because Birrueta was overpaid due solely to an innocent misrepresentation about his marital status made on his behalf, we hold the Department’s orders were timely and authorized in accordance with RCW 51.32.240(1)(a). We therefore reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the ruling of the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (Board) upholding the Department’s orders.</p>

Birrueta acknowledges that the report bears his signature below the statement, “I declare that these statements are true to the best of my knowledge and belief,” <em>id. </em>at 84, although he does not specifically remember signing it. The report states that at the time of his injury, Birrueta was married with one child.</p>

It is undisputed that the reason for these errors was <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>a miscommunication between Birrueta and the person who filled out his industrial injury report, attributable to a language barrier and the fact that Birrueta was “in and out of consciousness” at the time the report was filled out on his behalf.

Birrueta raised several challenges to the Department’s orders over the years, both pro se and with the assistance of counsel, but there is no indication that he ever attempted to correct the Department’s mistaken belief that he was married at the time of his injury.</p>

With the aid of a legal assistant in his attorney’s office, Birrueta filled out the required pension benefits questionnaire, accurately stating that he was unmarried at the time of injury. It is undisputed that the Department did not know that Birrueta was unmarried until it received his completed pension benefits questionnaire.</p>

The first order assessed an overpayment against Birrueta of $100.86 based on the amount Birrueta was overpaid between the time Department learned his true marital status and the time he was placed on a pension. The second order changed Birrueta’s marital status for compensation purposes from married to unmarried effective the day after the Department learned Birrueta’s true marital status.</p>

Both parties sought summary judgment. An Industrial Appeals Judge (IAJ) issued a proposed decision and order granting summary judgment to the Department, finding that there were no disputed material facts, that Birrueta innocently misrepresented his marital status when he applied for industrial insurance benefits, and that the Department’s orders were authorized by RCW 51.32.240(1). The Board adopted the IAJ’s proposed decision and order as the Board’s final decision. Birrueta then sought review in superior court.</p>

To effectuate this purpose, the IIA sets forth in detail when an injured worker is entitled to compensation and the amount of compensation the worker is entitled to receive. Ch. 51.32 RCW. There is no dispute that Birrueta is statutorily entitled to compensation at a rate equal to 60 percent of his wages at the time of injury. RCW 51.32.060(1)(g). There is also no dispute that he has been receiving compensation at a rate equal to 65 percent of his wages at the time of injury because his innocent misrepresentation caused the Department to mistakenly believe he was married.

    <p id="b583-4" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[201,691,1247,807]]]'>¶17 The statutory language is unambiguous on this point.

Similarly, to the extent that Birrueta contends the parallel statutory language in RCW 51.32.240(1) and (2) indicates the Department should be bound by final, binding determinations to the same extent as workers, that point is well taken but not dispositive.

First, he notes that overpayments “induced by willful misrepresentation,” RCW 51.32.240(5)(a), are specifically exempt from subsection (1)(b), even though such overpayments may not be addressable on direct appeal. Second, the statutes governing finality of binding determinations by the Department lend some credence to Bir-rueta’s broad reading. <em>See </em>RCW 51.52.060(4) (authorizing the Department to make further factual inquiries after issuing a binding determination within the time allowed for <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>a worker to appeal or within 30 days of a worker’s notice of appeal), .070 (a worker aggrieved by a Department order is “deemed to have waived <em>all objections or irregularities . . . </em>other than those specifically set forth in such notice of appeal or appearing in the records of the department” (emphasis added)).

Just like the Department, the worker seeking an adjustment of benefits “because of clerical error, mistake of identity, or innocent misrepresentation,” Laws of 1999, ch. 396, § 1(2), was required to “request an adjustment in benefits within one year from the date of the incorrect payment or it will be deemed any claim therefor [ ] has been waived,” <em><a href="/citations/?q=886%20P.2d%20189" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="886 P.2d 189">id.</a> </em>§ 1(2)(a).

Thus, rather than explicitly stating that adjustment of benefits based on adjudicator error must be sought within the time for direct appeal, the legislature simply stated that RCW 51.32.240 could not be used to address adjudicator error, and defined adjudicator error as including the types of errors that may be addressed on direct appeal.</p>

To continue the parity of remedies set forth in 1999, however, the legislature made it clear that the Department’s authority to recoup overpaid benefits caused by adjudicator error was subject to the same time limit: “[T]he department may only assess an overpayment of benefits because of adjudicator error when the order upon which the overpayment is based is not yet final as provided in RCW 51.52.050 and 51.52.060.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=886%20P.2d%20189" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="886 P.2d 189">Id.</a> </em>§ 7(1)(b).</p>

However, neither the Department nor the worker is entitled to use this as a means to evade the time limits for direct appeal.

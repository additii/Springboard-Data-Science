Furthermore, “we must consider the hardship to the petitioner! ] if we refused to review [the] challenge on direct appeal.” <em>Id. </em>at 789.

Cates’ challenge has no basis in the language of the condition actually imposed. The condition as written does not authorize any searches, and whether inspecting Cates’ residence or computer, the State’s authority is limited to that needed “to monitor [Cates’] compliance with supervision.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> CP at 18.

Some future misapplication of the community custody condition might violate article I, section 7, but that “depends on the particular circumstances of the attempted enforcement.” <em>Sanchez Valencia, </em>169 Wn.2d at 789.

I am not persuaded that a search of a computer means merely beholding its presence; rather, a search of a computer means scrutinizing the digital contents stored on the computer. Similarly, in this context “access” means “freedom or ability to obtain or make use of.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 11 (2002).

As we have stated, under the statutory scheme a court may impose community custody conditions that in other circumstances might qualify as a search — without any cause requirement — so long as the court limits those procedures to the extent necessary to monitor the offender’s compliance with the terms of his sentence.

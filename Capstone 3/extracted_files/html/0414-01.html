Such statutes and contracts made under them should receive a liberal interpretation in order to effectuate the beneficent object intended. The obligation of the bond, when construed in the light of the statute requiring its execution, is for the protection of laborers and materialmen, and under the statute is conditioned that the contractor shall pay all the indebtedness for labor and materials <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>furnished in the construction of said public building' or in making said public improvement.

    <p id="b443-4" data-blocks='[["BL_443.5",443,[199,1282,1206,752]]]'>In construing it the court said: “Language could hardly be plainer to evidence the intention of Congress to protect those whose labor or material has contributed to the prosecution of the work. • There is no language in the statute nor in the bond which is therein authorized limiting the right of recovery to those who furnish material or labor directly to the contractor, but all persons supplying the contractor with labor or materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract are to be protected. The source of the labor or material is not indicated or circumscribed. It is only required to be ‘supplied’ to the contractor in the prosecution of the work provided for. How supplied is not stated, and could only be known as the work advanced and the labor and material are furnished.”</p>

If the contractor sees fit to let the work to a sub-contractor, who employs labor and 'buys materials which are used to carry out and fulfill the engagement of the original contract to construct a public building, he is thereby supplied with materials and labor for the fulfillment of his engagement as effectually as he would have been had he directly hired the labor or bought the materials.”</p>

Such statutes are enacted in the exercise of a sound public policy. The contractor gets the benefit of the work done and materials furnished, and the statute requires him to pay for them. The contractor had supervision of the work, and it is easy for him to see what labor and materials are used in the work.</p>

If the contractor of himself do not inspire confidence among these, who must be subordinate to him, his ability in many cases to bid for large work must be weakened or altogether destroyed; as a necessary consequence, competition for work disappears, in large measure, and there follows a monopoly to the few contractors of large capital, with the inevitable result of exorbitant prices. Every one knows that the city will pay the principal contractor, but will he pay his sub-contractors and materialmen, whether he makes or loses on his contract, is the question with them. ’ ’</p>

Section 10 provides that the contractor shall enter into a bond with the district in the sum of $100,000 conditioned for the faithful performance of the contract. The bond provided by section 4 is for the purpose of securing the laborers and material men in the payment of their claims, and the bond under section 10 is intended to secure the district in the faithful performance of the contract by the contractor. The bond required under t'he general statute, § 6913, is intended to protect laborers and materialmen, and serves another purpose and operates in a different field than the bond for the faithful performance of the contract in favor of the road district, which is prescribed ¡by the special act creating the road district; and the special act does not repeal the general act.</p>

At trial, the trial court instructed the jury on lesser offenses for each of the charges except obstruction of a law enforcement officer. For each potential offense, the trial court provided the jury with a different verdict form, and it instructed the jury that for the verdict forms containing the greater charges, “[i]f you unanimously agree on a verdict, you must fill in the blank provided [on the verdict form] the words ‘not guilty’ or the word ‘guilty,’ according to the decision you reach. If you cannot agree on a verdict, do not fill in the blank provided [on the verdict form].” Clerk’s Papers at 52.

Glasmann argues that <em>Daniels </em>I is both. First, he claims that it is incorrect because it is inconsistent with the holding of the United States Supreme Court that “[j]eopardy terminates when the jury is dismissed without returning a verdict despite having a full opportunity to do so.” Pet’r’s Br. at 14 (citing <em>Green, </em><a href="/us/355/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="355 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6164126" data-case-paths="/us/355/0184-01">355 U.S. at 191</a>). Second, he argues <em>Daniels </em>I is harmful because it “interposes an unnecessary and burdensome step on defendants” to seek federal review in order to avoid being retried on the same charges. <em>Id. </em>at 18. Neither of Glasmann’s arguments are persuasive. First, the Supreme Court precedent that Glasmann cites does not involve an analogous “unable to agree” <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>jury instruction and thus the core reasoning from those cases is inapplicable here.

The core reasoning from <em>Green </em>and <em>Price </em>does not apply here because those cases did not involve “unable to agree” instructions. <em>See Green, </em><a href="/us/355/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="355 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6164126" data-case-paths="/us/355/0184-01">355 U.S. at 185</a>; <em>Price, </em><a href="/us/398/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="398 U.S. 323" data-case-ids="6170963" data-case-paths="/us/398/0323-01">398 U.S. at 324</a>.

After the prosecutor reinstated the first degree murder charge on retrial, the Court reasoned that it was a double jeopardy violation because the jury impliedly acquitted Green of first degree murder by staying silent on that charge in its verdict. <em><a href="/us/355/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="355 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6164126" data-case-paths="/us/355/0184-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/355/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="355 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6164126" data-case-paths="/us/355/0184-01">at 190</a>.

The Court summed up its reasoning by saying, “In brief, we believe this case can be treated no differently, for purposes of former jeopardy, than if the jury had returned a verdict which expressly read: ‘We find the defendant not guilty of murder in the first degree but guilty of murder in the second degree.’ ” <em><a href="/us/355/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="355 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6164126" data-case-paths="/us/355/0184-01">Id.</a></em>

The jury was specifically instructed that if it unanimously agreed on a verdict, it was required to fill in the blank on the verdict form. However, if it could not agree on a verdict, it was instructed to leave the form blank. Given those instructions, the jurors leaving the verdict form blank necessarily meant that they were genuinely deadlocked on the charge. Unlike <em>Green, </em>here the jury’s verdict form can be treated no differently than if the jury had returned a verdict that expressly read, “We were unable to agree on a verdict for first degree assault and first degree attempted robbery, but we find Glasmann guilty of second degree assault, second degree attempted degree robbery, first degree kidnapping, and obstructing a law enforcement officer.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Additionally, we are unpersuaded by the Ninth Circuit’s decision in <em>Brazzel </em>that a jury leaving a verdict form blank in this scenario amounts to an implied acquittal because being “unable to agree” is different from the genuine deadlock necessary for a mistrial. The Supreme Court decision on which the Ninth Circuit relies, <em>Washington, </em>uses the phrase “unable to reach a verdict” interchangeably with a jury being “genuinely deadlocked.” <a href="/us/434/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="434 U.S. 497" data-case-ids="6185127" data-case-paths="/us/434/0497-01">434 U.S. at 509</a>.

Although we recognize that a defendant who wishes to obtain relief will face the burden of filing in federal court, we find that degree of harm insufficient to overturn our precedent. It would undermine our role as an independent state court in our system of federalism if we overturned our precedent simply because it conflicted with a Ninth Circuit decision.

That is not so. While <em>Green </em>did explain two circumstances that terminate jeopardy, only the first circumstance is an “implied acquittal.” <em>Green’s </em>first rationale was that a jury “implicit[ly] acquit[s]” on a higher charge when it convicts on a lower charge while leaving the verdict on the higher charge blank. <em>Green, </em><a href="/us/355/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="355 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6164126" data-case-paths="/us/355/0184-01">355 U.S. at 190-91</a>.

Unable to agree instructions are a departure from traditional “acquittal first” instructions, which tell the jury that it can reach a lesser-included crime only after it unanimously acquits on the higher charge. <em>See Labanowski, </em>117 Wn.2d at 418 &amp; n.7.

We disclaimed, <em>“Ervin does not contend that the jury was dismissed without his consent before reaching a verdict or that the discharge of the jury was not in the interest of justice. </em>Rather, Ervin argues that the jury <em>had, </em>in fact, reached [an implied] verdict in regard to him.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=371%20P.2d%20541" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="371 P.2d 541">Id.</a> </em>at 753 n.5 (first emphasis added).

But, it fails to identify any part of the court’s reasoning in <em>Green </em>and <em>Price </em>that turns on this factual distinction. I fail to see how we can avoid the unambiguous, controlling command from the United States Supreme Court: “[when] the jury was dismissed without returning any express verdict on [the higher] charge and without [the defendant’s] consent,” and when the jury “was given a full opportunity to return a verdict and no extraordinary circumstances appeared which prevented it from doing so,” jeopardy terminates. <em>Green, </em><a href="/us/355/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="135" data-cite="355 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6164126" data-case-paths="/us/355/0184-01">355 U.S. at 191</a>; <em>accord Price, </em><a href="/us/398/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="136" data-cite="398 U.S. 323" data-case-ids="6170963" data-case-paths="/us/398/0323-01">398 U.S. at 329</a>. Unless the majority is suggesting that a jury given an unable to agree instruction is thereby deprived of a full opportunity to return a verdict — an unlikely proposition — the controlling legal principle is the same. The United States Supreme Court gave no hint that this principle turns on how the jury is instructed. Indeed, in <em>Ervin, </em>this court recognized the applicability of the <em>Green </em>framework even when unable to agree instructions are used. <em>Ervin, </em>158 Wn.2d at 752-53 (citing <em>Green, </em><a href="/us/355/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="137" data-cite="355 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6164126" data-case-paths="/us/355/0184-01">355 U.S. 184</a>).</p>

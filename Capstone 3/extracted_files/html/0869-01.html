His first two convictions were reversed on appeal. Potential jurors in his third trial were given an initial written questionnaire in an attempt to determine whether any knew of Slert’s prior convictions. Based on the written answers and after a discussion in chambers and out of Slert’s presence, four jurors were dismissed. For the first time on appeal, Slert challenged his conviction on the grounds that the discussion in chambers violated his right to be present at a critical stage of his own trial. We conclude Slert waived his right to raise his exclusion from the in-chambers discussion by not raising it at trial. We also conclude that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as it is plain the dismissed jurors had disqualifying knowledge of Slert’s prior convictions or disqualifying opinions about his guilt. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm his conviction.</p>

In that case, we held the defendant’s right to a public trial, factually, was not violated where during a recess, a random drawing of jurors was conducted. Although the right to presence was discussed, that discussion was in the context of the court having already concluded no constitutional closure occurred. Since <em>Jones </em>did not involve a constitutional claim, the analysis of preservation of error correctly applied the nonconstitu-tional analysis. <em>Jones </em>cannot be read as establishing a new rule applicable outside its context. Such a new rule would require overruling cases and establishing and applying <a id="p883" href="#p883" data-label="883" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*883</a>the applicable constitutional analysis—something that cannot be found anywhere in the <em>Jones </em>opinion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">7</a>

In <em>Irby, </em>we held it was the State’s burden to prove the violation to the defendant’s constitutional rights was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The <em>Irby </em>court found that the State could not meet this burden “because the State has not and cannot show that three of the jurors who were excused in Irby’s absence, namely, jurors 7, 17, and 23, had no chance to sit on Irby’s jury.” <em>Irby, </em>170 Wn.2d at 886.</p>

The court keyed in on the fact that not only was there no record to review, but also some of the excused jurors could have been impaneled on Slert’s jury. Stated inversely, the State could not prove there was no chance that some of the excused jurors would have sat on the jury. Based on this, the Court of Appeals correctly held that the error could not be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

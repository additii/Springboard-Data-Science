She did this by drawing checks from the nonprofit’s account payable to its clients, signing the back of those checks with her own signature, and cashing them at the nonprofit’s local bank. After the embezzlement was discovered, Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Company, the nonprofit’s insurance company, made the nonprofit whole. Travelers now seeks contribution from the bank in federal court. By submitting certified questions, that court has asked us to decide, among other things, whether a nonpayee’s signature on the back of a check is an indorsement. We are also asked whether claims based on unauthorized indorsements that are not discovered and reported to a bank within one year of being made available to the customer are time barred. We answer yes to both questions.</p>

Skils’Kin was the representative payee for many of its clients’ Social Security benefits, which were deposited into a single business checking account at Washington Trust Bank (Bank). Skils’Kin wrote checks as representative payee and agent for its clients’ use. Checks were written <a id="p927" href="#p927" data-label="927" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*927</a>either to the clients directly or to those who provided services to the clients. Clients and Skils’Kin entered into a “ ‘Financial Service Agreement’ ” in which clients “ ‘authorize SKILS KIN staff to act as agent/payee on [their] behalf.’ ” Doc. No. 191-1, at 2. Skils’Kin managed the monthly income and living expenses for about 1,000 clients. Shannon Patterson was a Skils’Kin employee who oversaw Skils’Kin’s bank account and was a signatory on the account. Skils’Kin adopted and delivered a corporate resolution to the Bank, authorizing Patterson to open deposit and checking accounts and to indorse checks.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Patterson was not the named payee on any of the checks at issue, and no named payee indorsed the checks to Patterson. Patterson’s bad acts were not discovered until she admitted them in a suicide note.</p>

The statements did not include copies of the backs of the checks, which would have readily revealed Patterson’s signature. Each statement contained contact information for the bank and listed cleared checks by check number, date, and dollar amount. Skils’Kin’s bookkeeper used these statements to reconcile the accounts. Beginning in 2011, Skils’Kin could access its checking account online at any time to view both the front and backs of checks that cleared its account. The online process required clicking an account to view, clicking a link for the front of the check, clicking a link for the back of the check, closing the check, and repeating as necessary.</p>

Travelers alleges that the Bank breached its duty of care as a matter of law by cashing checks to Patterson—who was not the named payee—and that the checks at issue are not “properly payable” under RCW 62A.4-401(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Thus, it reasons, the time bar under RCW 62A.4-406(f)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> does not apply. Washington Trust Bank argues that an oral agreement between the Bank and Patterson allowed tellers to cash the checks signed on the back by Patterson. The parties dispute <a id="p929" href="#p929" data-label="929" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*929</a>whether an oral agreement existed. The Bank also contends the “Terms and Conditions” contract for Skils’Kin’s pooled account at Washington Trust Bank gave Patterson authority to indorse checks on behalf of the named payees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Additionally, the Bank argues that Skils’Kin’s corporate resolution allowed Patterson to make an agreement with the Bank and that Skils’Kin clients were unable to personally sign the checks at the bank because they were home-bound, were disruptive, and/or lacked proper identification. As an affirmative defense, the Bank contends RCW 62A.4--406(f) precludes Travelers’ claims as time barred, while Travelers denies that Patterson’s signature qualifies under RCW 62A.4-406(f) and argues the statute does not apply.</p>

Second, are Travelers’ claims time barred under RCW 62A.4-406(f)? We answer both in the affirmative. We conclude that Patterson’s signature is an indorsement as a matter of law. RCW 62A.3-204(a). But whether Patterson’s signature is “unauthorized” for purposes of the latter half of the first question will depend on whether Patterson had the authority to cash checks as an agent for Skils’Kin’s customers. We recognize that whether Patterson had that authority is disputed and decline to reach that issue.</p>
    <p id="b969-4" data-blocks='[["BL_969.5",969,[201,1693,1253,422]]]'>¶10 Certified question 2 essentially asks us to decide whether the time bar provision of RCW 62A.4-406(f) has been triggered. To enjoy the benefit of RCW 62A.4-406(f)’s time bar on claims, a bank must make a statement of account available to its customer that meets certain statutory requirements.

Travelers contends that Patterson’s signatures do not meet any of the three alternatives in subsection (a) and are instead receipts that document “ ‘proof of who cashed the check [s].’ ” PL Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur.

Carefully read in context, the meaning of “indorsement” under Washington statutes is plain and controls in this case. If a statute’s meaning is plain on its face, we “must give effect to that plain meaning as an expression of legislative intent.” <em>Campbell &amp; Gwinn, </em>146 Wn.2d at 9-10. RCW 62A.3-204(a) does not expressly require the “named payee” to sign or indorse the instrument. Instead, the statute essentially provides four alternatives under which a signature may qualify as an indorsement. Under the fourth alternative, any signature operates as an indorsement unless it is unambiguously something else. Additionally, while the UCC does not define “indorsement,” secondary sources suggest any person’s signature could act as an indorsement, not just the payee or holder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> For example, <em>Black’s Law Dictionary </em>defines “indorsement” as (1) “[t]he placing of a signature, sometimes with an additional notation, on the back of a negotiable instrument to transfer or guarantee the instrument or to acknowledge payment” or (2) “[t]he signature or notation itself.” Black’s Law Dictionary 893 (10th ed. 2014). Definition (2) supports the conclusion that a signature or notation itself is an indorsement.</p>

Under a plain reading of RCW 62A.3-204(a) and its UCC official comment, a signature qualifies as an “indorsement” if it meets one of four alternatives: (1) it was made to negotiate the instrument, (2) it was made to restrict payment, (3) it was made to incur signer’s liability, or (4) it was a signature and not unambiguously something other than an indorsement. Patterson’s signatures arguably fit the first alternative and plainly fit the fourth—she signed the top area on the back of checks at issue where an indorsement would normally appear, she presented the checks for payment, and she did nothing that would indicate unambiguously that her signature was anything but an indorsement.</p>

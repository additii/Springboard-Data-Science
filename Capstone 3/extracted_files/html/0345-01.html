He was never afterwards able to do any work for the company. He was carried to the hospital after he received his injury, and advances were made by the plaintiff to his family. During the month of May, 1921, his account was overdrawn to the amount of $108.65. During the month of June following, $68 was‘advanced to .him. In July $36 in credit coupons and $29 in cash were advanced to him. Amounts of money were also advanced by the plaintiff to Ezell during the month of July, 1921. On the 20th day of July, 1921, Tim Ezell was severely injured in the boiler room of the plaintiff by a slab pile falling over on him and crushing his left leg. At the time Ezell was not actually employed by the company, but was convalescing from the injury to his arm which he had received during the previous April. He had just returned to the sawmill from the hospital on that morning. He was told to watch the engine room as closely as'possible in order to learn the work and be able to help fix anything in there that might be necessary. He was injured in the afternoon of the same day. About two months after he received the second injury, Ezell brought suit against the plaintiff for damages, and recovered judgment against it in the sum of $4,500. The defendant was notified to defend the action, but denied liability under the terms of the policy, and refused to do so.</p>

It is true that, in passing upon contracts of insurance or indemnity like the one now in hand, courts will resolve all doubts as to the meaning of the language used in favor of the insured. The reason is that the contract of insurance is made upon the written form of the insurer, and the insured has nothing to do with the language of the contract. <em>Home Mutual Benefit Assn. </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em><a href="/ark/142/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="142 Ark. 240" data-case-ids="1590534" data-case-paths="/ark/142/0240-01">142 Ark. 240</a>.</p>

The word “compensation” is evidently used as an equivalent for recompense for services rendered to the plaintiff in the operation of its business by its employees. Ezell was first injured in April, 1921. We do not think he thereafter received any compensation at the hands of the plaintiff for services rendered it in the operation of its business. It is true that the representative of the plaintiff speaks of his being employed after that time, but he also explains what he meant by the use of this expression. After he was' injured in April, 1921, Ezell was sent to the hospital and kept there at the expense of the plaintiff until the morning before he was injured in the following July. Advances were made to him from time to time to support his family, and the representative of the plaintiff states that It was its intention to deduct these advances from the sum it should pay him as damages for his injury.</p>

He was told to go in the boiler room and watch the work there, in order to familiarize himself with it. While watching the work there, on the afternoon of the same day, he was injured by a pile of slabs falling on him. He was not being paid for the services that he was rendering the plaintiff on that day. According to his testimony, he was merely there at the invitation of the plain<a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>tiff to watch the work.

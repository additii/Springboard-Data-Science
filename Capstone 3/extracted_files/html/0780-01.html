Specifically, Petitioners argue that meeting with Anagnostou constituted a sufficiently reasonable inquiry. Appellants’ Opening Br. at 22. To impose CR 11 sanctions when a recall petition lacks factual or legal sufficiency, the court must find that the attorney who filed the complaint failed to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the factual and legal basis of the claim. <em>Bryant v.

    <p id="b833-4" data-blocks='[["BL_833.4",833,[202,461,1247,891]]]'>¶20 Petitioners, representing themselves, failed to conduct a reasonable inquiry. Petitioners’ meeting with Anagnostou was insufficient because the commissioner declined to discuss any facts underlying the charges. Instead, Anag-nostou confirmed only his belief that the charges in the censure resolution were true. CP at 92-93. Because asking someone to confirm the truth of conclusory allegations is not a reasonable inquiry and Petitioners had no knowledge of the petition beyond its mere existence, Petitioners’ argument fails. CP at 357-58. As the superior court found, Petitioners made no attempt, reasonable or otherwise, to inquire into the factual information needed to support the charges in the recall petition. CP at 358. Not only did Petitioners fail to conduct a reasonable inquiry, but they also filed the petition without knowledge of the underlying facts. Accordingly, the recall petition plainly lacks factual and legal sufficiency.</p>
    <p id="b833-5" data-blocks='[["BL_833.5",833,[201,1371,1247,891]]]'>¶21 The record discloses that Petitioners filed the petition in bad faith and for purposes of political harassment. As the superior court noted, Ammons was intentionally unprepared during his deposition, showing a “cavalier” and “reckless attitude” to the recall and the court process. CP at 359. Despite this, Ammons admitted that the purpose of the recall petition was not to successfully recall Piper. CP at 197, 359. Instead, Ammons sought to force Piper to “retire like he should.” CP at 197. Petitioners also admitted that the recall petition was motivated by a desire to politically reshape the PUD board, not based on any misconduct by Piper. CP at 359. The record further reveals that Ammons had previously filed an unsuccessful recall petition against Piper. CP at 196. Given the repeated and wholly meritless efforts to recall Piper, Petitioners’ persistence suggests that they were motivated by something other than a sincere belief in the sufficiency of the recall charges.</p>

We reject this argument, as it mischaracterizes the record. Although the trial judge said at the sufficiency hearing, “I don’t question anybody’s good faith,” VBP (Dec. 20, 2013) at 28, the trial judge later clarified that he had not yet made any bad faith determination; he subsequently ordered a hearing on the issue, VRP (Jan. 15, 2014) at 15. After considering Petitioners’ depositions, the court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law wherein it articulated the basis for finding that Petitioners intentionally filed the recall petition in bad faith. Because defects in a trial court’s oral comments do not constitute proper assignments of error, Petitioner’s reliance on the judge’s statement at the sufficiency hearing is without merit. <em>See Rutter v. Rutter, </em><a href="/wash-2d/59/0781-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="59 Wash. 2d 781" data-case-ids="1028350" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/59/0781-01">59 Wn.2d 781</a>, 784, <a href="/citations/?q=370%20P.2d%20862" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="370 P.2d 862">370 P.2d 862</a> (1962).</p>

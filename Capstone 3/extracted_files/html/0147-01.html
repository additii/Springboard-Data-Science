    <p id="b203-5" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[202,498,1252,584]]]'>¶2 Cory Sundberg was charged with and convicted of unlawful possession of a controlled substance (methamphetamine) under RCW 69.50.4013(1). This statute sets forth a strict liability crime in that knowledge of the possession is not an element of the offense that the State has to prove. To reduce the harshness of this offense, courts have created an unwitting possession defense and placed the burden on the defendant to establish the defense by a preponderance of the evidence. At trial, the thrust of Sundberg”s argument was to assert an unwitting possession defense, assuming this burden of proof.</p>
    <p id="b203-6" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[201,1106,1248,476]]]'>¶3 Sundberg was arrested on an outstanding warrant while working on his foster father’s property, where he also resided. Sundberg was performing maintenance on a shed and cleaning the outside of their mobile home on the day he was arrested. Before being taken into custody, Sundberg asked the arresting officer’s permission to change out of his work overalls because they were wet from pressure washing the roof and sides of the house. Despite his request, Sundberg was transported to jail while wearing the overalls.</p>
    <p id="b203-7" data-blocks='[["BL_203.6",203,[202,1606,1252,421]]]'>¶4 Sundberg was taken to the county jail and given a set of jail clothing. The clothes Sundberg was wearing were given to a corrections officer for an inventory search. In a front bib pocket of the overalls, the corrections officer found a clear plastic bag containing a white substance. At trial, Sundberg stipulated to the fact that the bag found in the front bib pocket of the overalls contained 0.1 grams of methamphetamine.</p>
    <p id="b203-8" data-blocks='[["BL_203.7",203,[202,2052,1246,205]]]'>¶5 In his testimony, Sundberg argued unwitting possession, claiming he had no idea there were drugs in the front bib pocket of his overalls or that he knew the small plastic bag was even there.</p>

Sundberg had put out word that he needed some help and learned about Wood, who was looking for work, through his neighbors. Sundberg claimed that he occasionally lent Wood overalls to work underneath Sundberg’s house and shed to prevent Wood from ruining his own clothes, which were not suited for this type of work. Sundberg estimated that Wood borrowed the overalls four of the six days Wood helped with work. Sundberg testified that prior to the day of his arrest, he wore the overalls only once during the period of time he employed Wood. Sundberg testified that Wood was not present on the day he was arrested either because Sund-berg dismissed him or because Wood failed to show up that day.</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[201,1185,1253,370]]]'>¶7 The prosecutor cross-examined both Sundberg and his foster father about the existence, duties, and details of Paul Wood as a hired laborer. The prosecutor inquired into why Sundberg lent Wood his coveralls, why Wood needed to borrow coveralls, how well Sundberg knew Wood, how close the two lived to each other, how often Sundberg saw Wood, and if Sundberg could get ahold of Wood if needed.</p>

Sundberg’s attorney acknowledged that to successfully raise an affirmative defense of unwitting possession of the drugs, he had “to present enough evidence to show by a preponderance that he didn’t know [the methamphetamine] was there.” 1 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) at 187. His attorney also asserted that “[t]he only evidence we have that [Sundberg] did not know that the methamphetamine was in his pocket was his own words.” 1 VRP at 187. Additionally, despite the extensive cross-examination concerning Wood, Sundberg’s attorney explained in closing argument that very little was known about Paul Wood— only that he was hired as a laborer to help Sundberg for <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>roughly a week, that he borrowed Sundberg’s overalls to protect his clothes, and that Wood was not present on the day Sundberg was arrested.</p>
    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[203,516,1245,303]]]'>¶9 The claimed error on appeal occurred where, in the State’s rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor attacked Sundberg’s affirmative defense. The State argued, “[T]his enigmas [sic], mysterious man named Paul Wood—he might as well be called John Doe.” 1 VRP at 195. The State focused on what little was known about Wood:</p>
    <blockquote id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[247,862,1206,231]]]'>I asked [Sundberg] okay, tell us about Paul Wood; describe him for us, do you know him, how do you know him.

It’s their burden. <em>He’s not here. </em>There’s no evidence . . . that he . . . even exists.</blockquote>
    <p id="b205-6" data-blocks='[["BL_205.6",205,[200,1144,1247,313]]]'>1 VRP at 195 (emphasis added). Sundberg objected to the prosecutor’s argument, and the court overruled the objection. The prosecutor continued by saying Sundberg’s testimony “was obviously designed to tell a story to corroborate his defense. And again, it was his burden. <em>He didn’t bring in Paul </em>Wood.” 1 VRP at 196 (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b205-7" data-blocks='[["BL_205.7",205,[201,1479,1248,576]]]'>¶10 Out of the presence of the jury, Sundberg asked the court to instruct the jury to disregard the State’s argument that Sundberg failed to call Wood to testify. Sundberg argued the State’s comments were improper unless the prosecutor asked for a missing witness instruction. The State did not propose such an instruction. The court denied Sundberg’s request to disregard the State’s argument for two reasons. First, the court found no misconduct in the State’s closing argument, and second, Sundberg failed to identify case law to warrant such an instruction. Sundberg was convicted.</p>

The court held that the prosecutor’s comments on the defense’s failure to call Wood to testify did not improperly shift the burden of proof from the State to Sundberg because an attack on Sundberg’s evidence was proper where he had the burden to prove his affirmative defense of unwitting possession by a preponderance of the evidence. Nonetheless, the court held that the prosecutor committed misconduct by improperly invoking the missing witness doctrine, which created a substantial likelihood the jury verdict was affected.

The same reasoning applies equally here, where Sundberg testified about Woods and was cross-examined.</p>
    <p id="b210-4" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[202,736,1247,746]]]'>¶21 A defendant bears the responsibility of proving an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence, and no error occurs where the prosecutor attacks such evidence or a lack thereof. This distinction is especially pertinent here, where the prosecutor’s arguments related directly to the cross-examination of the defendant concerning Paul Wood. The missing witness doctrine plays no part in such circumstances. Additionally, while <em>Blair </em>recognized and discussed limitations applicable to the missing witness doctrine when the State would commit error in commenting on the defendant’s evidence, those limitations are irrelevant here. Significantly, <em>Blair </em>found no constitutional error occurred. This conclusion is supported by the reasoning in other cases.</p>
    <p id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[202,1505,1246,205]]]'>¶22 In <em>Contreras, </em>the Court of Appeals correctly held that it is permissible for a prosecutor to inquire into a defendant’s failure to present evidence that would corroborate defense testimony:</p>

On the contrary, the evidence supporting a defendant’s theory of the case is subject to the same searching examination as the State’s evidence.

    <p id="b211-4" data-blocks='[["BL_211.4",211,[201,628,1247,1278]]]'>¶23 In another case factually and procedurally similar to the one here, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed a prosecutor’s argument challenging a defendant’s lack of corroborative testimony evidence. <em>Barrow, </em><a href="/wash-app/60/0869-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="60 Wash. App. 869" data-case-ids="1719065" data-case-paths="/wash-app/60/0869-01">60 Wn. App. 869</a>. This case involved a defendant charged with unlawful possession of a controlled substance (a narcotics pipe that contained cocaine residue). Like our case, Barrow raised an affirmative defense of unwitting possession. Barrow testified that the pipe was his brother’s, that he “had surreptitiously taken the pipe from his brother in hopes of using it to get high with somebody, and that he therefore had not known the pipe contained cocaine residue.” <em>Barrow, </em><a href="/wash-app/60/0869-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="60 Wash. App. 869" data-case-ids="1719065" data-case-paths="/wash-app/60/0869-01">60 Wn. App. at 871</a>. During closing argument, the prosecutor questioned whether Barrow’s testimony was believable and repeatedly asked “‘[w]here is his brother’” who could corroborate Barrow’s defense. <em>Barrow, </em><a href="/wash-app/60/0869-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="60 Wash.

The court held that such comments were acceptable, reasoning that “a prosecutor can question a defendant’s failure to provide corroborative evidence if the defendant testified about an exculpatory theory that could have been corroborated by an available witness.” <em>Barrow, </em><a href="/wash-app/60/0869-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="60 Wash.

Before dying he made a statement, in which he said that he was fully aware of his impending death, and that ap<a id="p1068" href="#p1068" data-label="1068" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1068</a>pellant, Byron Arnold, had shot him, and that he had fully recognized Arnold as his assassin.</p>

These men, as well as the deceased, were colored. Arnold and Bryant went to a cafe to g*et some food, some time after midnight, and there is a conflict in the testimony as to whether they were accompanied there by a young colored woman named Annie May Cannon. At any rate, they were with this woman at the cafe, and a controversy arose over the conduct of Arnold and G-ary in her presence, which resulted in a fight, during the course of which Arnold was cut several times with a knife. He testified that he received a wound in his throat, one on his body, which was only prevented from being serious by the protection which a belt afforded, and another in his right hand. This latter appears to have been the most serious of them all, although each wound was dressed after Arnold had been carried to the hospital and the attendance of a surgeon had been secured, after some delay. The testimony is conflicting as to who was the aggressor in the fight at the cafe. Arnold also had a knife in this fight, but did not use it with any effect.</p>

Arnold requested Bryant to return the Cannon woman to her home, and she was finally induced to go, but, when they came near her home, she demanded that she be returned to the hospital, and this demand was -complied with. When they returned to the hospital Arnold asked Bryant to again take the woman home, as he feared his wife <a id="p1069" href="#p1069" data-label="1069" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1069</a>would come to the hospital and see her, and the woman was again carried away. After leaving the woman, Bryant drove to Arnold’s home, where Arnold was returned in the ambulance, and was met by the members of his household, including his mother.</p>
    <p id="b1087-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1087.4",1087,[165,627,1203,1738]]]'>The testimony on the part of the State is to the effect that Arnold was in a towering rage from the time he was cut until after he had shot Gary, and that he said to the surgeon who dressed his wounds that he would have another patient before day. Bryant was asked by Arnold’s mother, after arriving at Arnold’s home, to restrain Arnold and prevent him froim killing Gary. Arnold went to the ’phone and called the home of Gary, and told Gary it was Bryant speaking. When Bryant asked Arnold why he had done this, Arnold stated that he wanted to know if Gary was at home. This incident increased the apprehensions of the persons present, and they insisted that Arnold go to bed, but he took his pistol out of the house, saying he was going to hide his gun. When he returned he was told to wash the blood off his hands and face, and his wife began to heat some water for this purpose. Arnold went to bed, but, before the water was hot, left his bed and ran out of his room. Arnold’s wife called out to Bryant that Arnold had gone, and she and Bryant followed him. A man named McCoy, who was also at the house, went to his car to overtake Arnold, but found that the car key was not in the car. Bryant and Arnold’s wife followed Arnold, but did not overtake him, and, when they came near Gary’s home, which was about eight blocks away, they heard three shots in rapid succession, and, after a short interval, two more. They met Arnold returning from the direction of Gary’s home, and Bryant testified that Arnold said he had killed Gary, lie further testified that he and Arnold’s wife accompanied Arnold home, and, after arriving there, a hurried conference was held, in which it was agreed that all of those present would say that Arnold went to bed after returning from the hospital, and had not again left home that night.</p>

The police arrested Bryant in connection with their investigation of the killing, and he, too, stated, at the time of his arrest, that Arnold did not leave home that night. Upon his examination as a witness at the trial Bryant admitted that he had made this statement, and that he had made other statements which he then admitted were false. He was asked by the prosecuting attorney if he had given the same testimony before the grand jury as he was then giving before the trial jury, and, when he answered that he had, counsel for Arnold demanded the right to examine the minutes of the grand .jury, in order that they might determine whether this statement was true-. This request was denied, and an exception was saved to that ruling.</p>

The testimony given by the witness before the grand jury was, of course, immaterial, and the trial court would, no doubt, have ordered it stricken from the record had this been asked, but the request made was that these minutes be submitted to counsel for defendant for their inspection.</p>

In other words, if there has been sufficient time for the passion to cool, the provocation will not mitigate a subsequent killing to manslaughter. The question is not whether the blow was actually struck in a continuance of the passion, but whether there had been a reasonable time for the passion to cool in the case of an ordinary person, or whether the defendant did actually commit the homicide in cold blood.

Within this time, according to the testimony which tends to present this issue, the defendant had deliberated upon the manner in which he would take Gary’s life, and had thought out and executed the ruse of ascertaining whether Gary was at home by falsely stating that another person had called on the telephone; and, immediately after the killing had occurred, he had joined with others in the preparation of a simulated defense by which he might avoid the consequences of his act. This testimony also shows that, when the Cannon woman returned to the hospital, defendant contemplated the probable consequences .of the discovery of her presence there by his wife, and he contrived to have her sent away to avoid a meeting between <a id="p1078" href="#p1078" data-label="1078" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1078</a>these women.

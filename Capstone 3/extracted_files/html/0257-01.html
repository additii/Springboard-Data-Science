A subsequent order of the probate court adjudged Mrs. Edmondson to be an insane person.

It is insisted that this was the first of many frauds committed by Vaughan, in that no election was required, and that Mrs. Edmondson had the right to accept the benefits of the -will in addition to her dower.</p>

He provided that, if necessary, the entire income of his estate should be devoted to her care, and that, if necessary, the corpus of the estate might also be used, but it is apparent that <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>he did not contemplate that this contingency would arise. He had the purpose of establishing a school in the city of his residence for young men of his religious faith, and, after paying certain bequests and caring for his wife, he wanted the portion of his estate then remaining to be devoted to the school which he desired to be established. The testator’s purpose was manifest, if his wife’s necessities did not otherwise require, to hold the entire estate intact until after her death, selling, if necessary, the unimproved property first. Direction was given to keep the improved property in repair — all of it — and the idea that the will was to operate as to only half of the estate appears to be repugnant to the intention of. the testator, who had directed that all of his estate, both real and personal, be disposed of, managed and controlled by the trustee named, and it is generally held that the creation of a trust which contemplates possession and control by a. trustee of all the lands owned by the testator is inconsistent with the claim of dower.</p>

No finding was made as to her previous condition. Mrs. Edmondson was a witness in her own behalf, and her testimony makes it clear that she was never insane, although afflicted with arthritis, which disease rendered her physically helpless. There was a necessity for her to elect, as the language of the will refutes the idea that she might enjoy its benefits and have dower in addition.</p>

    <p id="b283-3" data-blocks='[["BL_283.4",283,[160,552,1201,338]]]'>The question is raised by Father Horan, the Catholic priest named as the residuary legatee in the will, that the order assigning dower was void, for the reason that proper parties were not before the court to support this order in that behalf, and that the property assigned as dower was grossly in excess of the value to which the widow was entitled.</p>
    <p id="b283-4" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[161,912,1203,850]]]'>The testator was survived by no children, and the estate disposed of by his will was a new acquisition, and not ancestral. Father Horan was the residuary legatee. The petition for the assignment of dower was first filed in the probate court of Sebastian County, but when it appeared that a part of the lands were in another county this proceeding was dismissed and suit was brought in the Sebastian Chancery Court for the same purpose. This suit was brought by Mrs. Vaughan, as guardian, and no process was served upon Father Horan, who had no notice of the proceeding until long after the commissioners appointed to assign dower had discharged that duty by assigning to Mrs. Edmondson one-half of the lands and the report had been approved and confirmed by the chancery court. There were no appearances in the chancery court except by Mrs. Vaughan, as guardian of Mrs. Edmondson, and by Mrs. Vaughan, as trustee under the will.</p>

He would therefore be entitled to vacate the decree assigning dower if prejudiced thereby and to be heard upon that question, but it does not appear that any substantial prejudice has resulted from this failure, and the decree will not be reversed on that account. Very competent men were appointed as commissioners, who appear, from their report, to have made the assignment of dower in a most exact and careful manner and after a minute <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>appraisement of the value of all the lands, as well as of all personal property. There is a difference of opinion as to the values, but it must be remembered that, having renounced the will, Mrs. Edmondson was entitled to homestead, as well as to dower, and that, although she took her homestead in addition to her dower, she was entitled to have the value of the homestead included in determining the value of the estate out of which the dower would be assigned. In other words, she was entitled to one-half of the whole estate as dower, and her homestead in addition. It was said, in the case of <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Hilliard, </em><a href="/ark/58/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="58 Ark. 293" data-case-ids="1329132" data-case-paths="/ark/58/0293-01">58 Ark. 293</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=24%20S.W.%20493" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="24 S.W. 493">24 S.

The items in controversy were so numerous that the court appointed a master to state both accounts, and elaborate reports were made by the master. According to the master’s findings and report, the liability of the estate of John H. Vaughan and his surety on account of his administration was fixed at $1,954.25.

Mr. Justice Eakin there said: “The courts of chancery have no power to take such cases out of the probate courts, for the purpose of proceeding with the administration. But their power and functions to relieve against fraud, accident, mistake, or impending irremediable mischief, is universal ; extending over suitors in all courts, and over the decrees in those courts,, obtained by fraud, or rendered under circumstances which render it inequitable that they should be enforced. Hence any frauds in the settlements of administrators or executors may be corrected. When that is done, if there be still a necessity for continued proceedings in the course of administration, such proceeding should go on in the probate court, upon the basis of the reformed settlement. The object of chancery intervention having been accomplished, the jurisdiction in equity should cease with the necessity. Otherwise the courts of chancery might make themselves courts of probate, in violation of the spirit and intention of the Constitution. If, however, there be no continuing necessity <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>for a further course of administration; if the assets be collected in, and the debts be all ascertained, and nothing remains but to fix the liabilities of administrators, executors and their sureties, and the rights of creditors, legatees and distributees, and to make adjustment on equitable principles, all that business comes within the more facile and effective operation of the remedial processes peculiar to equity practice.

In reversing that decree we held that, where a trustee accepts a trust created by a will, and qualifies and enters upon the discharge of the duties of trustee, he accepts the trust upon the condition named in the will, and is entitled to no other or greater compensation than the will allows, and that a direction that a certain per cent, of the income be paid for such services would be construed to mean the named per cent, of the net income, and not of the gross income.</p>

The will further provides that, if in the opinion of the judge of the probate court the compensation allowed is not sufficient, the court “may make allowance of such amount as may be sufficient to compensate my said trustee for executing this trust.” The court was therefore given a discretion in the matter of compensation, and it does not appear that any fraud was <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>practiced upon the court in the exercise of this discretion, and the judgment in this respect is therefore final and should not be disturbed.</p>

The testimony is conflicting as to whether the bakery was operated at a loss, and as to the extent of such loss, if any.

It is insisted that, as Vaughan should have operated the bakery as trustee, no charge should be made against him as executor. It is apparent, however, that Vaughan was not acting in the capacity of trustee, but in that of executor, and the probate court evidently proceeded upon the assumption that Vaughan would not assume to act as trustee until he had completed his duties as executor. At any rate, Vaughan included the bakery and its equipment, much of which was of a perishable nature, in his inventory as executor, all of which he later sold, and he was charged with the proceeds of the sale. The probate court, no doubt, considered the nature and extent of Vaughan’s labor in regard to the bakery and the results he was accomplishing in its management in fixing his compensation in this behalf, and, as no showing was made that fraud was practiced in procuring the orders of the probate court in regard to the bakery, we think they should not be disturbed.</p>

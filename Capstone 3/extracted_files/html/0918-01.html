Otherwise, every judgment rendered by a court where its jurisdiction rested upon its having determined the existence of a certain fact upon <a id="p928" href="#p928" data-label="928" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*928</a>the existence of which its jurisdiction to proceed to judgment must depend rests forever upon the dubious proposition as to whether every other court whose proceedings encounter it will take the same view of what was established by the evidence before the court that rendered it.”</p>

The parties can waive nothing essential to the validity of the proceeding, and all statutory requirements must be observed; but, in determining upon collateral attack, whether such has or has not been the case, we know of no reason why the same verity should not be imported to a decree for divorce which guards the sanctity of a decree rendered by a superior court having jurisdiction of the parties and the subject-matter.”</p>

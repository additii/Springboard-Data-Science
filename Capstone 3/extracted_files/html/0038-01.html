The road is primarily on the property of their neighbors John and Deborah Clark. The Gamboas and Clarks used the road for their respective purposes for many years without an objection from either family. After disputes arose between them, the Gamboas filed suit to obtain a legal right to use the road.</p>

Specifically, the Gamboas must show that their use of the road was adverse to the Clarks (i.e., without the Clarks’ permission). Since the evidence shows a reasonable inference that the Clarks let the Gamboas use the road out of neighborly acquiescence, we hold that the Gamboas did not show that their use of the road was adverse to the Clarks’. Therefore, the Gamboas may not continue using the road, and we affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>

The Gamboas own a 17-acre western parcel to farm alfalfa, and the Clarks own a 25-acre eastern parcel to farm grapes. The parcels were created in 1964 when the original co-owners, the Padghams and McConnells, split up the 42-acre parent parcel into the 17- and 25-acre parcels described above. The Padghams and McConnells sold the 25-acre eastern parcel (which included the road) to the Slouin family, the family preceding the Clarks to that parcel. The Padghams and McConnells retained the 17-acre western parcel.

The Gamboas have occasionally bladed the road and on one occasion applied gravel to maintain its condition. When the Clarks came to their parcel in 1995, they used the road to farm grapes, including watering the grape plants and spraying for weeds. The trial court found that “[t]he Gamboas and the Clarks both used the roadway as described above without any disputes until 2008. Each party was aware of the other’s use of the roadway, but no one objected to the other’s use until a dispute arose in 2008.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 195.</p>

Third, the presumption applies when the evidence demonstrates that the owner of the property created or maintained a road and his or her neighbor used the road in a noninterfering manner. <em>Cuillier, </em>57 Wn.2d at 627.

Because we deemed the use permissive in its inception, we applied the stronger presumption of permissive use, requiring the claimants to put forth evidence that they made a positive assertion that they claimed to use the path as of right. <em>Id. </em>at 713-14.

Br. of Pet’rs at 9 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Roediger, </em>26 Wn.2d at 714). They fail to recognize, though, that in <em>Roediger, </em>we also stated that there is a presumption of permissive use whenever there is a reasonable inference of neighborly accommodation. 26 Wn.2d at 711 (“ ‘where persons traveled the private road of a neighbor in conjunction with such neighbor and other persons, nothing further appearing, the law presumes such use was permissive, and the burden is on the party asserting a prescriptive right to show that his use was under claim of right and adverse to the owner of the land’ ” (quoting Thompson, <em>supra, </em>§ 521, at 106)). The “permissive in its inception” discussion occurred in the context of our finding that the evidence supported a reasonable inference that the land use <em>arose out of, </em>or resulted from, neighborly sufferance and acquiescence. <em>Id. </em>at 707, 713-14. That finding created a stronger presumption of permissive use than would be typical in neighbor accommodation cases. <em>See id. </em>

In <em>Cuillier, </em>the claimants wanted to use a landowner’s orchard road. <em>Id. </em>at 625. The claimants argued that because they used the road for the prescriptive period without permission, “there was a presumption that their use was adverse and that the burden was then upon the owner to show the use was permissive.” <em>Id. </em>at 626. We called the rule presuming adverse use into doubt, saying, “We think, however, a more accurate statement, based on the results and holdings in all of our cases, would be that such unchallenged use for the prescriptive period is a circumstance from which an inference may be drawn that the use was adverse.” <em>Id. </em>at 627. However, we also recognized that there is a presumption of permissive use when the evidence demonstrates that the owner of the property created or maintained a road and his or her neighbor used the road in a noninterfering manner.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
      <em>Id. </em>Thus, the core portion of <em>Cuillier </em>that is about “inferences” applies only to the competing presumption of adverse use and is irrelevant to this case.

This is a very narrow view of the constitutional provision, which was intended only to place a restriction upon the formation of improvement districts in cities and towns by requiring that it be done upon the consent of a majority in value of the property owners, and that the assessments “shall be <em>ad valorem </em>and uniform,” but there was no attempt to define what would constitute a local improvement. It is true that the statutes of this State, as originally enacted pursuant to the terms of the Constitution, did not authorize formation of districts for the acquisition of property, but we have decided that it is within the power of the Legislature to confer such authority, and no doubt on that subject was expressed by the court. <em>Sembler </em>v. <em>Water and Light Imp.

Moreover, the purpose- of the formation of this district was not merely the acquisition of the system, but to extend it and to repair and improve it. The validity of a similar district was upheld by this court in a recent decision, though the point was not discussed. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Forrest City Special Improvement District, ante, </em>p. 356.</p>

In other words, it is argued that this statute does not provide for obtaining the separate consent of the owners of property in each of the old districts, but merely for the consent of a majority in value of the owners of-property in the new district.</p>

The constitutional requirement was therefore complied with by obtaining a majority of all the owners of property in the district.

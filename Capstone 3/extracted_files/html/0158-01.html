    <p id="b215-9" data-blocks='[["BL_215.12",215,[201,1403,1253,746]]]'>¶2 Kelley is the elected auditor of Washington. Knedlik filed a recall petition against Kelley with the secretary of state. In the petition, Knedlik charged Kelley with misfeasance, malfeasance, and breach of his oath of office for (1) violating the residency requirements of his office, (2) failing to adequately investigate and report alleged illegal activity by Sound Transit, and (3) pressuring employees of the auditor’s office to hire Jason JeRue without following proper employment procedures. The secretary of state served a copy of the petition on Kelley and on the attorney general’s office, which prepared the ballot synopsis for the charges. After preparing the synopsis, the attorney general petitioned the superior court for a determination on the sufficiency of the charges and for approval of the ballot synopsis.</p>

The superior court first ruled that Knedlik’s motion for the court to rule that there is a vacancy in the auditor’s office was not properly before the court as part of a recall action.

The recall petition asserts that Kelley failed in his duties by neglecting to “[p]romptly report any irregularities to the attorney general,” citing RCW 43.88.160(6)(e). Entitled “State Budget<a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>ing, Accounting, and Reporting System,” the legislature passed chapter 43.88 RCW for the purpose of establishing “an effective state budgeting, accounting, and reporting system for all activities of the state government....” RCW 43.88.010 (formatting omitted). The duty to report irregularities to the attorney general under RCW 43.88.160(6)(e) arises from the auditor’s duty to “[r]eport to the legislature the results of current post audits that have been made of the financial transactions of each agency.” RCW 43.88-.160(6)(a) (emphasis added). Under this chapter, “agency” is defined as “every state office, officer, each institution, whether educational, correctional, or other, and every department, division, board, and commission, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.” RCW 43.88.020(4). Therefore, RCW 43.88.160(6)(e) applies only to audits of financial transactions of state agencies.</p>

The recall petition makes no argument and does not establish that the definition of “state agency” applies to Sound Transit as a local government entity. Indeed, chapter 43.09 RCW supports the distinction between a local government entity and state agency, as it provides different definitions for each. <em>Compare </em>RCW 43.09.260(3)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> (defining “local governments”), <em>with </em>RCW 43.09.290 (defining “state agency”).

The recall petition asserts that Kelley failed to “ ‘investigate improper governmental activity under chapter 42.40 RCW/” quoting both RCW 43.88.160(6)(f) and RCW 42.40.020(3). Chapter 42.40 RCW is the state employee whistle-blower protection act. This act protects state employees who report improper governmental activity and gives the auditor the discretion to determine which reports to investigate. <em>See </em>RCW 42.40.020(2), (3), ,040(l)(b). The act defines “improper governmental action” as an improper action taken by a state employee in performance of that employee’s official duties. <em>See </em>RCW 42.40.020(2), (6)(a). This definition, in context of the statute as a whole, reveals that the duty to investigate improper government activity arises only in the setting of state agencies and state employees. As stated above, Sound Transit is a local governmental entity and not a state agency. Therefore, the auditor’s office has no duty to “investigate improper governmental activity under chapter 42.40 RCW” in relation to Sound Transit. Because the recall petition fails to demonstrate that there is a legal duty for Kelley to investigate and report on Sound Transit by identifying an applicable “standard, law, or rule,” this charge is legally insufficient. <em>See In re Recall of Ackerson, </em>143 Wn.2d at 377.</p>

There is no information on the face of the recall petition that would allow the voters to evaluate this charge if it were on the ballot. <em>See In re Recall of Telford, </em>166 Wn.2d at 154.</p>
    <p id="b223-4" data-blocks='[["BL_223.4",223,[202,795,1246,584]]]'>¶22 In briefing to our court, the petitioner alleges that Kelley “falsely signed” a 2013 audit of Sound Transit and failed to follow the “Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards” in carrying out that audit. But the petitioner’s briefing contains no facts showing that Kelley failed to follow accounting standards, or what constitutes “falsely signing” an audit. Even if we were to consider these additional allegations—coming from beyond the face of the recall petition—the petitioner still does not show any specific facts that would make this charge factually sufficient to proceed to voters.</p>

While newspaper accounts are “not <em>per se </em>insufficient to show some form of knowledge of the facts,” <em>In re Recall of Reed, </em>156 Wn.2d at 58, mere reference to unidentified news reports and a complete lack of reference to any specific actions by Kelley is insufficient. <em>See In re Recall of Sun, </em>177 Wn.2d at 256 (misfeasance, malfeasance, and violation of oath of office charges were sufficient because they were supported by media reports along with “numerous” declarations from witnesses, e-mails, letters, and other documents); <em>In re Recall of West, </em><a href="/wash-2d/155/0659-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="155 Wash. 2d 659" data-case-ids="3766138" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/155/0659-01">155 Wn.2d 659</a>, 666, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20P.3d%201190" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="121 P.3d 1190">121 P.3d 1190</a> (2005) (misfeasance charge was factually sufficient because petitioner’s knowledge was based on newspaper articles containing lengthy transcripts of conversations supporting the official’s misconduct, which the official admitted to having).</p>

We therefore express no opinion on the definition of the term “reside” within RCW 43.09.010 and article III, section 24 or what it means to “reside at” within article III, section 24. We do note, however, that authorities analyzing where a person “resides” when the person owns more than one home reach differing conclusions in different contexts. <em>See, e.g., Nat’l Gen. Ins.

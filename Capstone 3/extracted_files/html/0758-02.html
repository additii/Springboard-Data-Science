    <p id="b759-13" data-blocks='[["BL_759.12",759,[147,1205,1208,325]]]'>That on the-day of May, 1876, plaintiff executed and delivered to defendant a promissory note for $200, payable on the first day of January, 1877; and to secure the payment of the note gave him a mortgage upon four bales of cotton. That the note was in possession of the defendant; and a certified copy of the mortgage made an exhibit to the bill.</p>

Afterwards plaintiff’ was summoned as a witness on behalf of the State, to appear before said Circuit Court to testify in the case of the State against William Breathwit,-defendant herein, on an indictment for perjury, and at the Spring Term, 1876, the venue in the case being changed to Bradley Circuit Court, on motion of defendant, plaintiff was required to enter into recognizance to appear as a witness for the <a id="p760" href="#p760" data-label="760" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*760</a>State before said court at the Spring Term, 1876, where defendant was tried on the charge of perjury, and acquitted, plaintiff not being called to testify. That after the acquittal and discharge of defendant, he threatened plaintiff with two criminal prosecutions, one for slander and the other for perjury, growing out of and based upon the evidence given by plaintiff as a witness before the grand jury of Dorsey County as above stated. But proposed and offered to plaintiff that he would not prosecute said two criminal charges if plaintiff would execute a note to him for the sum of $200, payable on the 1st of January, 1877, and secure the payment thereof by a mortgage on the property of plaintiff.</p>

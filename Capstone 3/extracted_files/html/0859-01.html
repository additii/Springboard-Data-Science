J. Dover testified that at all times the dry goods company stock was treated and used as a part of the assets of the Mercantile Company, and that this was with the full knowledge and assent of all the heirs — his mother in her lifetime and his brothers and sisters, including the plaintiffs. He perhaps might have so intended it, but all of the heirs testified that they did not so understand it and presumed that the Mercantile Company was handling the dry goods company stock for the benefit of the estate, just as it was renting the farms and managing the other property left by T. M. Dover which was not included in the corporation formed shortly after his death. It is manifest that M. J. Dover was the guiding spirit in the management of the affairs of the family after the death of the father. He was fully trusted by his mother and by his brothers and sisters, and they relied upon his business experience and ability. We are constrained to think that he, in fact, managed the corporation and the Dover estate with unusual ability, and we find no evidence of any actual fraud intended or practiced by him. Under his guidance the farms were made to produce annually an adequate revenue, and the assets of the corporation more than doubled in value under his administration, having in its treasury on January 1,1928, more cash than the value of its entire assets in the beginning. But it is also apparent that he managed the entire business as if it were his own, without consulting his brothers and sisters, and who, if they had anything at all to do with the business, did just as he bade them.</p>

      <a id="p865" href="#p865" data-label="865" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*865</a>It is practically undisputed that the dry goods company stock was not included in the assets of the corporation at the time of its formation, hut remained a part of the Dover estate, just as the lands and other property, and the inference is warranted that, in the transfer of the stock to the Mercantile Company and its sale, M. J. Dover was acting purely on his own initiative and without any adequate knowledge on the part of his brothers and sisters of what he did or what his intentions were. Therefore it cannot be said that the finding of the chancellor is against the preponderance of the evidence on the question of the ownership of the Dry Goods Company stock, for the act of M. J. Dover in having the stock transferred in the name of the Dover Mercantile Company and the subsequent sale could not change the ownership without the knowledge and consent of the other heirs, and, if the stock was the property of the estate, then the $240 dividend item was correctly charged against the mercantile company.</p>
    <p id="b885-3" data-blocks='[["BL_885.4",885,[154,1343,1200,611]]]'>M. J. Dover, as president of the mercantile company, attended to all the business of the heirs with respect to their farms. These services were no doubt valuable, but they appear to have been voluntary, and he served without compensation either expected by him or consented to by the heirs. The $70 item as commissions, considering the work he did for the heirs, is not at all unreasonable, the trouble is he had no authority to make this charge. Likewise, as to the item of $59.20, loss sustained on account of one of the tenants, as there was no agreement on their part shown to assume or pay this account, it, too, was an improper charge.</p>

After a careful deliberation, we conclude that, under the peculiar facts of this case, it has no application. The chancellor found that the mercantile company had at all times, since its organization, acted as the agent or trustee for the heirs at law of T. M. Dover in handling the stock of the dry goods company, collecting the dividends thereon and collecting rents on the property owned by the said heirs at law. This finding is fully warranted by the testimony, and not only are these the facts, but it is evident the mercantile company not only collected the rents, but managed the farms and other property of the Dover estate.</p>

None of the girls had any knowledge at all of the conduct of the business. J. A.

The only knowledge he had of the conduct of the business was just what he might gain from the entries he made on the books. He was the one who entered the two items of stock dividends on the books of the company, one to the credit of Mrs. Dover and one to the credit of the mercantile company, and he had an opportunity of knowing of the entry made on the books of the company immediately after the sale of the dry goods company stock, but it is not clear that he realized the significance of these entries or that he knew what they imported. He testified that he did not know just how the dry goods company stock was to be handled. Prom-1917 down to the sale of the dry goods company stock in 1928, annual dividends were remitted to the Dover Mercantile Company, but only two items entered. What became of these dividends is uncertain. There is no contention made that M. J. Dover got them personally and the inference seems to be that they were given to Mrs. Dover, the mother, or used for her convenience. During all this time the Dover Mercantile Company, acting through M. J. Dover, was the continuous general agent and manager of the property of the Dover estate. It was therefore something more than a mere agent and sustained such relation to the heirs as to raise its position from that of a mere agent to one of trusteeship, and thus makes applicable the rule announced in the authorities Cited <em>supra.</em>

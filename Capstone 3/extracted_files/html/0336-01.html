The parties could not agree on the amount of just compensation for the taking, so the matter proceeded to trial. AIC contends it is statutorily entitled to attorney fees because Sound Transit failed to make a valid settlement offer 30 days before trial. Specifically, AIC argues that the 30-day offer Sound Transit made did not reflect the reduced temporary construction easement it ultimately obtained, making the offer ineffective or resulting in a total abandonment of the condemnation. AIC also seeks a new trial, alleging the trial court erroneously allowed Sound Transit’s counsel to question AIC’s president, Sandra Oh, about the taking valuation of a nontestifying appraisal expert.</p>

    <p id="b377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_377.5",377,[202,725,1252,475]]]'>¶3 Sound Transit is a regional transit organization authorized to construct and operate a high-capacity electric light rail system (Light Rail). RCW 81.112.010; Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 1-2. Pursuant to its statutory authority to condemn real property to construct the Light Rail, Sound Transit sought easements over property owned by AIC. The property consists of approximately 112,626 square feet of land area and is developed with a four-story, 130-room hotel constructed in 1988.</p>
    <p id="b377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_377.6",377,[202,1234,1246,582]]]'>¶4 In the condemnation action, Sound Transit sought to take a portion of the property for a permanent guideway easement (PGE) to construct the Light Rail along the property’s western boundary. It also sought a temporary construction easement (TCE), which afforded Sound Transit a nonexclusive, three-year time period to construct the Light Rail and encumbered up to 3,882 square feet of the property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Except when Sound Transit required exclusive occupancy, the TCE afforded AIC the right to use the TCE area for any purpose that did not interfere with Sound Transit’s construction activities.</p>

This offer was based on an initial valuation by its appraiser of $79,825 for the PGE, $46,600 for the TCE, and $15,875 for improvements. Sound Transit advised AIC that it had the right to obtain its own appraisal at Sound Transit’s expense. <em>Id. </em>AIC exercised <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>this right, and its appraiser valued the easements at $485,000. AIC submitted its appraisal to Sound Transit in July 2012 in a letter expressing its belief that it was entitled to $485,000 for the easements. Suppl. Br. of Resp’t Sound Transit, App. A at 1. Rejecting AIC’s valuation, Sound Transit asked AIC to reconsider its original offer.</p>
    <p id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.4",378,[202,675,1247,573]]]'>¶6 On June 14, 2013, 30 days before trial, Sound Transit made a written settlement offer to AIC of $463,500. The offer was for both the PGE and the TCE, and was marked “For Settlement Purposes Only.” CP at 1334. The offer provided that it “remain[ed] open until accepted, rejected, or until withdrawn by Sound Transit” and was “made subject to Sound Transit’s reservation of its right to reevaluate this offer and submit a revised 30-day offer if the pending trial date is continued.” <em>Id. </em>The parties could not agree on the amount of just compensation due, and the matter proceeded to trial.</p>
    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.5",378,[201,1269,1253,793]]]'>¶7 On July 1, 2013, Sound Transit informed AIC that it would change the configuration of the TCE because it no longer needed to relocate the property’s driveway to construct the Light Rail.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> That same day, Sound Transit provided AIC with an updated parcel map and updated right-of-way plan showing the change. The modification reduced the total TCE area by approximately 1,000 square feet. Suppl. Br. of Resp’t Sound Transit at 3. These changes to the TCE were designed to ameliorate AIC’s loss of business costs from the property’s use as a parking lot. Notwithstanding the language in the TCE, Sound Transit communicated to AIC that its construction would require only sporadic use of the TCE area during the three-year period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Sound Transit did not revoke or reduce its settlement offer despite the reduced easement.</p>

      <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>¶8 AIC then filed a motion in limine, requesting that the trial court exclude any evidence that Sound Transit intended to use the TCE area for less than the entire three-year term. At oral argument on the motion, the trial court agreed with AIC that if Sound Transit had the right to exclusive use of the TCE area for the entire three-year term, it could not tell the jury that its actual use would be less. The trial court granted AIC’s motion, “provided, however, this ruling . . . does not preclude [Sound Transit] from submitting a revised form of [TCE] providing for the actual time of use of the easement area.” CP at 904.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b379-4" data-blocks='[["BL_379.4",379,[201,967,1248,429]]]'>¶9 On the first day of trial, Sound Transit withdrew its 30-day settlement offer. With leave of the trial court, Sound Transit provided AIC with revised TCE language regarding time of use. This occurred after jury selection, but before opening statements. Although the revised TCE still provided a three-year easement term, it limited Sound Transit’s exclusive use of the TCE to a maximum of 160 nonconsecutive days.</p>
    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[201,1423,1253,805]]]'>¶10 AIC also moved in limine to exclude evidence of its July 2012 valuation letter stating that it was entitled to $485,000 for the easements. Sound Transit responded that it had no objection to AIC’s motion so long as Sound Transit’s first appraisal would also be excluded on the grounds that both parties’ appraisals were for purposes of settlement negotiations. Finding that neither initial appraisal letter constituted a settlement offer under ER 408 (and also rejecting AIC’s claim of work product privilege), the trial court ruled that AIC and Sound Transit could “figure out if you want to get into this history [of the first appraisals]. If one of you does, the other one can.” Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (July 16, 2013) at 53-54. Accordingly, the trial court did not “grant [ ] this motion on either side.” <em>Id. </em>at 55.</p>

VRP (July 24, 2013) at 1072, 1094. AIC’s appraisal expert, Scott Biethan, testified that the PGE was worth $210,000, the TCE was worth $32,124, and AIC was entitled to $1,457,000 for diminished value, totaling $1,699,124 in just compensation due.

Before doing so, Sound Transit inquired about possible avenues to introduce the letter into evidence. The court advised, “I think to get this document in you need to lay a foundation. I don’t know how to be more clear than that. I don’t read the case law as saying that apparent authority is enough to introduce a party admission.

This provision entitles a con-demnee to attorney fees under RCW 8.25.070(1)(a) only if the condemnor fails to make <em>any written offer </em>in settlement at least 30 days before trial to fix compensation. Because it is undisputed that Sound Transit made a timely written settlement offer to AIC for $463,500, AIC’s claim for attorney fees fails under the plain meaning of the statute. The text does not allow for an interpretation that vitiates the meaning of “any offer” when the scope of the taking is modified subsequent to the offer.

It would prevent a condemnor from making any change to the property interests comprising the overall taking <em>any </em>time after the initial 30-day offer, at the risk of paying the condemnee’s attorney fees and expert witness fees (unless perhaps the condemnor is able to have the trial continued and submit a new offer for the modified taking).

We find AIC’s concerns misplaced. Our precedent requires a condemnor to present an adequate taking description to allow the landowner time to prepare for trial. <em>See In re Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle, </em><a href="/wash-2d/67/0923-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="67 Wash. 2d 923" data-case-ids="1048245" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/67/0923-01">67 Wn.2d 923</a>, 928, <a href="/citations/?q=410%20P.2d%20790" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="410 P.2d 790">410 P.2d 790</a> (1966). Here, AIC has not shown that the modified TCE was inadequately described or otherwise resulted in prejudice to its trial preparations. Nor did AIC present evidence that Sound Transit committed bad faith or engaged in gamesmanship in its settlement negotiations. Instead, the record discloses that Sound Transit reduced the scope of the TCE based on a changed understanding of its construction needs and to ameliorate AIC’s concerns about decreased parking. De<a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>spite the scaled-back TCE, it kept the same settlement offer on the table until trial.</p>

RCW 8.25.070(1)(b) separately awards fees to the condem-nee when the condemnor’s offer is less than 90 percent of the jury’s just compensation verdict. In this case, the jury awarded AIC <em>more </em>compensation for the revised TCE than AIC’s appraiser testified it was worth. CP at 1415. AIC suggests condemnors will have an incentive to make an inflated pretrial settlement offer based on a greater taking than ultimately sought at trial in order to avoid an award of fees under RCW 8.25.070(1)(b). Not only did AIC not rely on this provision in its fee motion, but the argument also overlooks the counterincentive a condemnor has to offer in settlement only that amount justified by the taking it actually needs. It is difficult to imagine that condemnors will generally be motivated to make artificially high settlement offers.</p>

No offer was ever “on the table” for property interest claimed during trial. The offer caused, if not compelled, the property owner to seek fair value for their property at trial, where Sound Transit essentially said, “Never mind, we do not need that much property, and therefore settlement should be for a lesser fair value for the condemned property interest.” Torturing the statutory purpose, the majority denies the property owner fees and costs even though no offer was ever made for the property Sound Transit actually took. Under the statute as written, this “changing the rules after the game is played” is unsupportable, or should be. The majority’s new rule encourages such gamesmanship. I dissent.</p>

The majority essentially rewrites this provision and untethers the “offer” from the “interest in the property being condemned,” defying common sense and the most elementary of principles of statutory construction and contracts. Some relationship must exist between a condemnor’s offer and what it is taking. This case arose because Sound Transit changed its claim <em>during trial.</em>

The majority at least acknowledges that our precedent requires a condem-nor to present an adequate taking description <em>before trial </em>to allow the landowner time to prepare for trial. Majority at 347 (citing <em>In re Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle, </em><a href="/wash-2d/67/0923-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="67 Wash. 2d 923" data-case-ids="1048245" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/67/0923-01">67 Wn.2d 923</a>, 928, <a href="/citations/?q=410%20P.2d%20790" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="410 P.2d 790">410 P.2d 790</a> (1966) <em>(Kenmore Props.)). </em>It is true that a property owner before trial has a “right to be adequately advised of the exact nature of the proposed <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>taking, so that he [or she] may evaluate the resultant damage.” <em>Kenmore </em>Props., 67 Wn.2d at 927. However, the majority’s reading of <em>Kenmore Properties </em>ignores that the same reason why a property owner must be adequately informed of the exact nature of the taking before trial underlies why he or she must be informed of the exact nature of the taking when being given a settlement offer. It makes sense that a condemnor must provide the property owner a description of the taking to allow the landowner to make a decision to accept any offer and, if not, prepare for trial.</p>
    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[203,965,1245,373]]]'>¶41 For the property owner to determine if a settlement offer is fair—and consequently whether to litigate the condemnation action—the property owner must know what exactly Sound Transit is offering and what property interest Sound Transit is taking in exchange for that offer. Any change to what Sound Transit provides to the property owner makes the calculation impossible.</p>
    <p id="b392-5" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[197,1363,1252,1016]]]'>¶42 Engaging in what is essentially a statutory rewrite, the majority claims that AIC failed to demonstrate that the temporary construction easement (TCE) was inadequately described, or that the changed TCE “otherwise resulted in prejudice to its trial preparations,” or that Sound Transit “committed bad faith or engaged in gamesmanship in its settlement negotiations.” Majority at 347. Under the majority’s view, evidently, all the statute requires is that any offer “comes close” to describing the property and, if so, the property owner must now prove some type of materiality or prejudice. Nowhere in the statute does it say this. What the statute says is that the offer must match the property interest sought. In this case, at trial, both the physical footprint and the duration changed from that specified in the offer. Whether this change was or was not “material” to the property owner’s decision can never be known with certainty. Nor should condemnation trials include this issue. One certainty is established: the property owner never had the decision to accept an offer never presented.</p>

      <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>¶43 The majority offers no cases to support its rule that a court must somehow consider materiality of any changes. Unfortunately, the majority fails to explain how the property owner can prove “materiality”—by what standard or much else. Fortunately, the statute answers this question. The statute provides that the burden is on Sound Transit to make offers for what it wants. Any change voids the offer.</p>
    <p id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[202,737,1247,1016]]]'>¶44 Even if it were, under the statute, appropriate to engage in such an inquiry, a taking reduced by both its physical footprint and a reduction in duration is a lesser taking. A lesser taking is material in relation to the evaluation of the offer of just compensation. Here, the original TCE allowed for exclusive use of up to 1,080 days; the new TCE narrowed that exclusive use to 160 days.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">11</a> The changes included a 25 percent decrease in the area of the easement and a reduction of the duration by 2.5 years. Sound Transit presented an entirely different picture of the taking to the jury than its pretrial offer had specified. Under the majority’s approach, a condemnor can overstate its taking at the beginning of condemnation proceedings and then present the jury with a lesser taking to insulate itself from having to pay a fee award. While this likely was not the deliberate strategy of Sound Transit, the majority seems to ignore the possibility and risk of gamesmanship and abuse from its result, which conflicts with the statutory purposes.</p>
    <p id="b393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_393.5",393,[202,1778,1246,421]],["BL_394.1",394,[201,345,1248,584]]]'>¶45 The majority claims RCW 8.25.070(1)(b)—which separately awards fees to the condemnee when the condem-nor’s offer is less than 90 percent of the jury’s just compensation verdict—provides a safeguard against the risk this potential abuse. Majority at 348. For this ostensible safeguard to be triggered, the jury award must necessarily be greater than the pretrial offer, which will almost never be the case when the property interest is reduced. In other <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>words, RCW 8.25.070(1)(b) protects the condemnee only when the condemnor has offered <em>less </em>than what the jury awards. In instances where the pretrial offer is based on a taking that is less than the taking presented at trial— either by its duration or its physical amount or both, as is the case here—then the jury award will never be less than the pretrial offer. Under the statute, this does not make sense. Apparently, no question in this case exists that had Sound Transit gone to trial on its original claim, the award would have been larger. Because of the difference, no comparison between the offer and the award can be done.</p>
    <p id="b394-4" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[197,952,1251,684]]]'>¶46 The statute was designed to protect property owners who receive unfair settlement offers from bearing the costs of pursuing just compensation. Conversely, the statute was also designed to protect Sound Transit from bearing the costs of litigation when a fair offer of settlement is made. The property owner has a choice to make. If it decides to litigate, the statute determines fairness by comparing what was offered before trial to what the jury awarded. That comparison is simple where the taking on which the initial offer was based is the same as the taking evaluated by the jury. It becomes impossible and meaningless to compare the pretrial offer to the jury award where the property interests are different.</p>
    <p id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.5",394,[202,1667,1246,314]]]'>¶47 Under the statute, an offer is inextricably linked to the property interest on which the offer is made. In this case, because the offer was for a different property interest than that sought at trial, it is simply void and AIC is statutorily entitled to recover its fees and costs. For these reasons, I dissent.</p>

The fence enclosed a venerable cherry tree on Pendergrast’s lot. For several years, Pendergrast and Matichuk maintained their lots as if the fence was the boundary line between them. Unfortunately, the fence stood several feet from the deed line and, according to the legal description, on Matichuk’s land. The cherry tree stood on the disputed part of Pendergrast’s lot. Instead of suggesting mediation or arbitration or filing a quiet title suit, and over Pendergrast’s strenuous objection and despite her tearful plea, Matichuk tore down the fence, built a new one on the deed line, and had the cherry tree cut down. Litigation <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>ensued, and Pendergrast prevailed at summary judgment, at trial, and at the Court of Appeals. Matichuk claims the disputed land is his and if not, the jury gave Pendergrast too much relief. Finding no error, we affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>

Five months later, Pendergrast bought an adjoining lot that included a 1907 home she intended to turn into a bed-and-breakfast. Pendergrast, who had retired from a job as a nursing instructor after a car accident left her unable to safely handle medical equipment, hoped to use the bed-and-breakfast to generate income for herself and her disabled daughters.</p>

The fence had been built about six to eight feet west of the deed line, enclosing the venerable cherry tree on the parcel with the 1907 home. The Conines’ disclosure statement for the Pendergrast parcel asserted that there were no “encroachments, boundary agreements, or boundary disputes,” suggesting they believed the fence was on the property line. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 33. Consistently, the Pendergrast property was described in the listing agreement as partially fenced. <em>Id. </em>at 32.

    <p id="b599-4" data-blocks='[["BL_599.4",599,[200,579,1248,530]]]'>¶4 The record does include Matichuk’s deposition testimony that he paced off the lot and “came to the conclusion the fence was not on the property line. Actually, let me rephrase that, I came to the conclusion I didn’t know where the fence was in relation to the property line.” CP at 52. He testified he was not concerned about any discrepancy because he “was buying on the description of the property.” <em>Id. </em>at 53. Nothing in the record suggests he sought clarification about the relation between the fence and the deed line before buying the lot.</p>
    <p id="b599-5" data-blocks='[["BL_599.5",599,[201,1133,1248,908]]]'>¶5 Meanwhile, Pendergrast planned a nautically themed bed-and-breakfast that would make use of the house, several outbuildings, and a tree fort in the cherry tree she planned to make look like the bow of a ship and use as a viewing station. At some point, she called Matichuk to ask him if he would consider selling one of his parcels to her. Nothing came of that conversation, and Matichuk did not use the occasion to alert Pendergrast that he was concerned the fence between their properties was misplaced. Over the next few years, she discussed her plans with the city and invested about $130,000 in remodeling the home. During those years, she used and maintained the property up to the fence line. From time to time, she would have casual conversations with Matichuk. They never discussed the boundary line. Pendergrast’s plans suffered a significant setback when a pipe on an upper floor burst, necessitating costly repairs.</p>
    <p id="b599-6" data-blocks='[["BL_599.6",599,[202,2066,1246,313]],["BL_600.1",600,[202,345,1246,484]]]'>¶6 In 2008, Matichuk had the property surveyed and determined that the legal description of his lot extended several feet beyond the fence into the lot Pendergrast had purchased. The next year, by letter, he informed Pender-grast that he had discovered that the fence encroached on his land and that he intended to move it to the deed line, <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>much to her distress. Pendergrast believed her parcel extended to the fence line and that moving it would leave her with insufficient room to develop the bed-and-breakfast. Via counsel, she informed Matichuk that she claimed the property enclosed by the fence and instructed him not to move the fence. When the letter was unavailing, Pender-grast called Matichuk in tears and begged him not to move the fence. The day after that call, Matichuk had the fence torn down. Later, Matichuk cut down the cherry tree.</p>
    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[201,855,1248,1024]]]'>¶7 Pendergrast sued, seeking, among other things, to quiet title in the strip of land between the old fence line and the new one. She also sought damages for trespass and timber trespass, including treble damages under the timber trespass statute, RCW 64.12.030. Both parties moved for summary judgment. Nothing in the record before us suggests that Matichuk opposed Pendergrast’s summary judgment motion on the grounds that a material question of fact was presented by his deposition testimony that he did not know where the fence was located in relation to the deed line. Instead, he contended that he was entitled to prevail at summary judgment because “there is absolutely no evidence that the common grantor ever established a boundary line different from the deeded boundary,” “no evidence of any formal or specific agreement about the boundary,” and “[no] evidence that the parties acted in a way after the sale to suggest that they agreed that the fence was the boundary.” CP at 310-11. Judge Mura granted partial summary judgment in favor of Pendergrast in a brief order.</p>

Pendergrast testified that she begged Matichuk not to move the fence, that she “felt violated,” that his actions left her in serious financial straits at a time when she was carrying both of her disabled daughters’ mortgages, and that she could not sell the house while the lawsuit was pending. 2 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Jan. 30, 2014) at 51. We have not been provided with Matichuk’s testimony. The jury was instructed that damages for both tres<a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>pass (removing the fence) and timber trespass (cutting the cherry tree) “include economic and non-economic loss that you find was proximately caused by the trespass and/or timber trespass,” and that if they found Matichuk committed either trespass, they should consider whether his actions caused Pendergrast emotional distress. CP at 196.</p>
    <p id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[202,691,1246,705]]]'>¶9 The jury found for Pendergrast. It awarded her $5,200 in economic and $75,000 in noneconomic damages for the trespass. It awarded her $3,310 in economic and $40,000 in noneconomic damages for the timber trespass. The trial judge tripled the timber trespass economic damages under RCW 64.12.030 and .040, but declined to triple the noneconomic ones “because such a trebling is not specifically provided in RCW 64.12.030, which, as a penal or punitive statute, should be interpreted and applied literally and narrowly.” <em>Id. </em>at 237. The judge also ordered equitable relief in the form of abatement of the trespass and the entry of new legal descriptions. Matichuk’s motion for a new trial or reduction of noneconomic damages was denied.</p>

The Consumer Protection Act, Laws of 2007, ch. 498, § 3, and the Insurance Fair Conduct Act, Laws of 1961, ch. 216, § 9, reflect decades of modern tort law development. The timber trespass statute, on the other hand, dates back to territorial, prestatehood days. <em>See </em>Laws of 1869, ch. 143, § 55. Respondent called nothing to our attention to suggest that the territorial legislature contemplated that people would have an emotional attachment to their trees and shrubs or had cause to contemplate whether timber trespass could cause emotional distress, let alone trebling of those damages. Indeed, the purpose of the statute was to “ ‘discourage persons from carelessly or intentionally removing another’s <em>merchantable </em>shrubs or trees on the gamble that the enterprise will be profitable if actual damages only are incurred.’” <em>Broughton Lumber Co., </em>174 Wn.2d at 625 (emphasis added) (quoting Laws of 1869, ch. 48, § 556, at 143). Because we construe punitive statutes strictly, and because <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>the timber trespass statute does not expressly authorize trebling of punitive damages, I cannot say that the territorial legislature in 1869 intended to discourage the careless or intentional removal of merchantable timber by trebling damages for emotional distress. Therefore, I respectfully dissent in part.</p>

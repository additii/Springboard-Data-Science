It appears that, prior to September 10, 1924, A. L. Bullock owned two rice farms in Arkansas County, one in section 34, township 2 south, range 5 west, and the other in section 14, township 2 south, range 5 west, upon which he had given to the appellant, Snerly, a mortgage securing the payment of a promissory note for $17,000. On September 10; 1924, he gave appellant a chattel mortgage on one-third of'all the rice to be grown on the farms in the year 1925, as additional security on the payment of said debt. On the 25th of February, 1925, he executed-to appellant another crop mortgage on an undivided one-half of all rice grown on the farms for 1925, less the one-third interest already mortgaged, which was to secure advances to be made by ¡appellant for making the crop, but no such advances were made, nor is anything claimed by appellant on this mortgage. <a id="p979" href="#p979" data-label="979" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*979</a>Thereafter Bullock leased both farms to Beard for the year 1925, agreeing- to furnish one-half the seed rice and the water delivered for irrigation, for which he was to have one-half. the rice crop produced, Beard receiving the other one-half for making the crop.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b997-5" data-blocks='[["BL_997.4",997,[90,625,1202,593]]]'>On the 20th of April, 1925, Bullock entered into a written contract for the sale of the lands in section 34 to W. 0. Stacey and J. P. Malbry, appellant Snerly having signed said contract, agreeing to release the land from the $17,000 mortgage under its terms. Under said contract of sale Bullock, on the 30th of May, 1925, conveyed by warranty deed to Stacey and Mabry, appellees, the lands in section 34; the tenant, Beard, being in possession of said lands at the time of the execution of both the said contract of sale and the deed of conveyance, but no rice crop had been planted upon the lands at that time.</p>

There was produced on the lands in section 34, 3,676.41 bushels of rice, which was delivered to the Arkansas Rice Growers’ Cooperative Association, to be milled and sold pursuant to the terms of the “marketing- agreement” then in force and covering the crop in controversy. All the parties conceded that the tenant, Beard, was entitled to one-half the proceeds of this crop, the other one-half being claimed by appellant, Snerly, <a id="p980" href="#p980" data-label="980" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*980</a>by Stacey and Mabry, appellees, and also by tlie Arkansas Light &amp; Power Company, under its mortgage from them.</p>

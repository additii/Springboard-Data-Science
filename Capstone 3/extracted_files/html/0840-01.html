H. Gray, as trustee for Thompson &amp; Gregory, and for an accounting of the rents ¡and profits of the lands, and for the value of certain timber cut by Thompson from the lands. The deed of the trustee was to Thompson. Before the final submission of the cause Thompson, the grantee in- the trustee’s deed, died, and the cause was revived in the name of his executor. Upon the final submission of the cause the relief prayed was granted, the trustee’s deed was canceled, and la judgment was rendered against Thompson’s estate for the amount of the rents in excess of the debt secured by the deed of trust and for the value of the timber cut by Thompson.</p>

Thereafter, on August 2, 1927, the heirs of Washington brought a new suit, in which the heirs of Thompson were made parties, and the complaint recited the facts above stated, and which are -set out in detail in the former opinion.</p>
    <p id="b859-8" data-blocks='[["BL_859.10",859,[215,1959,1198,301]]]'>A demurrer to this complaint was sustained, upon the ground that the original cause of action had not been brought within the time allowed by law after the death of Thompson, which, as the former opinion recited, occurred on May 12, 1924.

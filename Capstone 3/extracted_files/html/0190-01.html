Two barrels of mash had been run and the mash in two more was ready to run, and the still was warm from the last run, which must have been made that .night. The boys were filling up the two barrels with more water. Appellant unscrewed the connection and let the refuse run out of the pot, and in carrying it away discovered the officers, and ran. The still was on his grandmother’s place, in the pasture, and he said that he had discovered it before, and that he was down there that morning putting the water in the mash to keep the cows from eating the shorts, under the instruction of his grandmother, who had lost a yearling from eating mash at a still. Said he did not own the still and the mash, and had no control over it, and ran away when he saw the officers because he was frightened.</p>

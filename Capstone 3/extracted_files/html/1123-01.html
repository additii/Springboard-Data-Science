The.decree of the chancery court was based upon a holding by the court that the plea of <em>res judicata </em>of the defendants should be sustained. It is elementary that all questions which might be litigated in an action of which the court has jurisdiction are <em>res judicatae </em>as to all parties thereto and their privies. The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>is based on public policy, reason and experience. If all questions that have been decided by the court are to be regarded as still open for discussion and revision between the same parties and their privies, there would be no end of litigation until the ingenuity of counsel and the financial ability of the parties had been exhausted.</p>
    <p id="b1146-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1146.7",1146,[304,1090,1204,868]]]'>Then, too, the decision of the court in .the mandamus suit on the former appeal became <em>stare decisis </em>and we are bound by it on the present appeal. It was there held that, after the sufficiency of a referendum petition was duly certified by the proper officer, a signer was not entitled to withdraw his signature in the absence of fraud. The court also said that the correctness of the city clerk’s determination of the sufficiency of the petition for referendum could only be made in the chancery court. <em>Southern Cities Distributing Company </em>v. <em>Carter, </em><a href="/ark/184/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="184 Ark. 4" data-case-ids="1438661" data-case-paths="/ark/184/0004-01">184 Ark. 4</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20S.W.2d%201085" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="41 S.W.2d 1085">41 S. W. (2d) 1085</a>. This holding was based upon the court’s construction of amendment No. 7 relating to the initiative and referendum. The amendment itself specifically provides that the sufficiency of all local petitions shall be decided in the first instance by the county clerk or city clerk, as the case may be, subject to review by the chancery court.</p>

If any of his defenses are expressly cognizable in equity, he is entitled to have them tried as in equity proceedings, and, for this purpose, to a transfer of the case to the chancery court. The principle of <em>res judicata </em>extends not only to the questions of fact and of law which were decided in the former suit but also to the rights <a id="p1127" href="#p1127" data-label="1127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1127</a>of recovery or defense which might have been but were not presented. In short, the uniform rule adopted by this court is that the judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction operates as a bar to all defenses, either legal or equitable, which were interposed or which might have been interposed in the former suit. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>King, </em><a href="/ark/135/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="135 Ark. 43" data-case-ids="1571549" data-case-paths="/ark/135/0043-01">135 Ark. 43</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=204%20S.W.%20614" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="204 S.W. 614">204 S.

The court held that these questions could have been litigated in the mandamus suit, and that the award of the mandamus adjudicated the legality of the petition in all respects and settled the <a id="p1128" href="#p1128" data-label="1128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1128</a>question of the duty of the commissioners to call the election.</p>

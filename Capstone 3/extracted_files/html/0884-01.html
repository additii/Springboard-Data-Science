At that time, Trey was in counseling with Mark Heeringa, addressing issues stemming from Trey’s early childhood history of abuse and neglect.

During a counseling session on October 7, 2014, Trey was upset because three boys had teased him at school. Trey told Heeringa that he thought about taking a gun to school and shooting the boys. He also said he wanted to kill them and for them to know the pain that he felt. He described a specific plan to shoot the three boys and then himself. First, he would get a gun from his grandfather’s gun safe and <a id="p889" href="#p889" data-label="889" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*889</a>shoot one boy at the boy’s house before school.

As noted, Deputy Boyer separately interviewed Trey at length and was also convinced that his threat to kill the boys was serious.

Further, Trey repeated his plan to kill the boys to Deputy Boyer, who also testified regarding the plan’s depth of detail, Trey’s demeanor, and Trey’s absence of misgivings about what he was planning. Deputy Boyer testified that he “took it as a very credible threat due to [Trey’s] detailed plan and the very matter-of-fact nature of how he explained doing it and putting his plan into action.” 1 RP (Dec. 8, 2014) at 58.

Following coaxing from his therapist to discuss his angry thoughts and plans, and in the context of the therapist-patient relationship, he disclosed his desire to violently harm three other students. Thereafter, a deputy sheriff asked the young man to repeat what he had previously disclosed to the therapist. The young man—Trey M.—did as he was told. There was no evidence that Trey M. ever volunteered these statements without being coaxed by adults in positions of authority; there was no evidence that <a id="p909" href="#p909" data-label="909" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*909</a>Trey M. ever actually communicated these statements to the three students directly; and there was no evidence that Trey M. intended, desired, or knew that his coaxed disclosures of these statements to responsible adults would be communicated to those three other students indirectly In fact, the trial court judge explicitly found that Trey M. told the deputy sheriff “that he was having a hard time wanting to do the wrong things.” Clerk’s Papers at 43 (Finding of Fact 1.10). Nevertheless, as a result of following the instructions of the therapist and the deputy sheriff to put his disturbing thoughts into words, Trey M. was charged with and convicted of three counts of felony harassment—for putting these thoughts into words.</p>

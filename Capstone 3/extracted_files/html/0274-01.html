The evidence shows that the place where witness was when he saw the appellant after the difficulty was approximately 30 feet from the place where the difficulty occurred. The fight occurred in the back part of the drugstore, and this statement was made after the fight and after the appellant had come in to the front of the drugstore.</p>

The declaration need not be precisely coincident in point of time, but it must be a part of the transaction, tend to explain it, and must be voluntary and spontaneous, and made at a time so near as to preclude the idea of deliberate design.

Nó hard and fast rule, can be laid down as to the admissibility of evidence as a part of the <em>res gestae. </em>This is true because the circumstances presented in different cases vary so widely that the courts must determine <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>the admissibility of such evidence from the circumstances as presented by the particular case under consideration.</p>

The defendant’s brother was present the whole time, and struck deceased as soon as the defendant ceased shooting him.

And certainly there would be no difficulty in giving a connected and correct account of the occurrence of the fight in the back of the drugstore without the testimony as to what appellant said when he went up to the front of the drugstore.

At the time the blow was struck, Tobin testifies that he saw the parties, but immediately turned and went back; he does not say that they did not have a hammer or crowbar, but he testifies that the crowbar back there was about four feet long, and the hammer a ¡common clawhammer.

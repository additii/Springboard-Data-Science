R. McKennon &amp; Son to the order of Walter C. Hudson, who had been president of the- bank. Hudson had sold the note to the bank for its face value, less a discount of six per cent, to its due date, and had received credit on his deposit for the proceeds of the note. The receiver demanded payment of the note, but the makers refused to pay unless a certain credit was allowed, which, being refused, resulted in this suit.</p>

This defense passed out of the case under the authority of <em>Bank of Hartford </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em><a href="/ark/107/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="107 Ark. 232" data-case-ids="1344047" data-case-paths="/ark/107/0232-01">107 Ark. 232</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20S.W.%20512" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="154 S.W. 512">154 S.

Under the rental contract, which constituted the consideration for the note, it was agreed that the tenants should have credit for necessary repairs, including damage done by fire. Hudson advised his tenants that the buildings on the farm were insured against loss by fire, and directed that he be notified if such loss occurred. Two buildings burned, and Hudson was advised of that fact, and directed his tenants to rebuild them. This was done, and the cost thereof, with certain smaller items for repairs, constitute the credits which the makers of the note demanded be allowed before paying the balance due on the note.</p>

Act 267 of the Acts of 1917 (vol. 2, Acts 1917, page 1441) is the most comprehensive legislation on the subject of counterclaim and set-off of which we have any knowledge. It is there provided that a counterclaim “may be any cause of action in favor of the defendants, or some of them, against the plaintiffs, or some of them,” and that “A set-off may be pleaded in any action for the recovery of money, and may be a cause of action arising either upon contract or tort.”</p>

After the bank had been taken over by the State Superintendent of Banks for liquidation, its transferee sued the maker of the note, who sought to set off against the note the amount of his deposit in the bank on the day it closed its doors. The opinion refers to several sections of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Act of that.State which are identical with our own, but it quotes also § 2307, Rev. Code 1919, of that State, which reads as follows: “In case of an assignment of a thing in action, the action by the assignee shall be without prejudice to any set-off or other defense existing at the time of, or before notice of, the assignment; but this section shall not apply to a negotiable promissory note, or bill of exchange, transferred in good faith, and upon good consideration, before due.” We have no statute containing any such limitation on set-offs or counterclaims.</p>

      <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>Referring to the manner in which the note had 'been transferred, the court there said: “It is also well established that such a transferee, whether his title be legal or equitable, takes title subject to equities and defenses. The apparent unanimity on this point is as marked as the lack of unanimity as to the time when such equities and defenses may accrue.”</p>
    <p id="b398-3" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[282,693,1201,1049]]]'>The opinion recites that on the day the note matured the maker had on deposit with the bank more than sufficient funds to pay the note, 'but it is recited also that he did not use the deposit for that purpose. The opinion recites that the maker’s balance on the date the bank sold the note was only $7.94, but it was said: “It is not necessary therefore to decide whether the $7.94 was a valid set-off between appellant [purchaser] and respondent [maker]; because the deposit balance on the day of transfer was entirely withdrawn.” The- opinion had quoted cases holding that “the defense of set-off or counterclaim which is available to a debtor as against an assignee of a creditor must have existed as a present right when the assignment was made,” and construed § 49 of the Negotiable Instruments Law of that State, which is identical with § 7815, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, as meaning that “* * * the set-off that may be interposed against a negotiable promissory note transferred without indorsement, in good faith, and for value, must be a set-off which existed as a present right when the transfer was made.”</p>
    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[284,1754,1199,148]]]'>The effect of the decision in that case is that, there being no right of set-off at the time of the transfer, that right could not subsequently be acquired.</p>

    <p id="b399-3" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[175,668,1204,644]]]'>This declaration of the law is itself decisive of this case. The consideration for the note here in suit was.the rental contract between Hudson and C. R.

It is true these repairs had not been made when the note was executed, but- it is true also that it was executed in contemplation that such repairs would be made and that the cost thereof would be credited on the note. The credit claimed arose out of the same transaction as the note itself, and the right thereto, when the repairs had been made, existed at the time of the transfer of the note to the bank.</p>

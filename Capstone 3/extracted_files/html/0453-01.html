    <p id="b483-5" data-blocks='[["BL_483.4",483,[201,671,1206,891]]]'>There was no error in refusing to require the prosecuting attorney to elect. Under §3016 of,Crawford <em>&amp; </em>Moses ’ Digest, larceny and embezzlement may be charged in one indictment. The evident purpose of the statute was to enable the State to embrace in one indictment a charge for larceny and embezzlement where the charge resulted from the same transaction and it might be doubtful whether the proof would fit the one charge or the other. Larceny and embezzlement belong to the same family of crimes. If the actual or constructive possession of the property was in the owner, then the wrongful conversion would be larceny, and not embezzlement. There must be lawful possession in the defendant at'the time of the conversion to constitute embezzlement. The distinguishing feature of embezzlement is that the taking essential to larceny is not required, a breach of trust taking its place.</p>
    <p id="b483-6" data-blocks='[["BL_483.5",483,[203,1582,1204,769]],["BL_484.1",484,[326,380,1198,99]]]'>The charge of larceny and that of embezzlement in the present case grew out of the same transaction and related to the same warrants. Hence, under the statute, they were properly charged in the same indictment, and the two charges might be tried together, just as, under a different subdivision of the same section, forgery and the uttering of a forged instrument may be joined in the same indictment and the defendant tried on both charges at the same time, where they grew out of the same transaction and related to the same instrument. <em>Zachary </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/97/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="97 Ark. 176" data-case-ids="1318871" data-case-paths="/ark/97/0176-01">97 Ark. 176</a>. Where the statute .authorizes two offenses of a kindred nature to be joined in one indictment, and they would be proved by substantially the same evidence, or evidence connected with a single line of conduct, it necessarily follows that the defendant’s <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>rights are not jeopardized by a single trial. Therefore we hold that this assignment of error is not well taken.</p>

According to the evidence for the State, W. H. Hall was chairman of the Board of Control for State Charitable Institutions in the State of Arkansas during the period- of the transactions involved in this case. Vouchers were issued to the J. B. Ford Company, a corporation, in the sum of $1,631.97 for merchandise and supplies sold to the State by said corporation. After these vouchers had been-issued by the Board of Control, of which W. H. Hall was chairman, they were filed with the Auditor of State, as required1 by the statute, and warrants were drawn by him on the State Treasurer for said amounts. These warrants were carried to the office of the State Treasurer and were there paid by him to the person having the warrants in his possession. The Treasurer required the person having possession of the warrants to indorse the same before he would pay them.</p>

She receipted for the warrant for $975.80 which had been issued to the J. B. Ford Company, and gave the warrant to the defendant. She sometimes cashed warrants, which had been issued to persons who had sold merchandise to the State charitable institutions, at the State Treasurer’s office, but did this because the defendant told her to do so. In each instance she gave the money which she received at the State Treasurer’s office, by cashing the-warrants, to the defendant, and never gave any money to any other member of the board. No other member of the board except the defendant ever handled any of the warrants issued to merchants who had sold supplies to the State charitable institutions under contracts made with the Board of Control. The witness receipted for the warrant for $975.80 issued to the J. B. Ford Company, and gave the warrant to the defendant.

He resigned his. office in March, 1922, and was confined in the State Hospital for Nervous Diseases for some time thereafter. Various members of the' medical staff in the hospital and other physicians testified that the defendant was insane from tbe excessive use of alcoholic liquors, or perhaps from other causes. Some of these experts state that, while they observed that the defendant was addicted to the excessive use of intoxicating liquors for some time before <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>he resigned, they could not state that he was insane on this account, or for any other reason.</p>

When the witnesses testified that the warrants were cashed at the State Treasurer’s office, or that the money was paid to the defendant on these warrants, it is fairly inferable that they meant that the warrants were paid in United States currency. We think this is the effect of our previous decisions on this branch of the case. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/130/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="130 Ark. 90" data-case-ids="8717958" data-case-paths="/ark/130/0090-01">130 Ark. 90</a>, and <em>Kent </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/143/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="143 Ark. 439" data-case-ids="1589368" data-case-paths="/ark/143/0439-01">143 Ark. 439</a>.</p>

B. Ford Company, and on this account there is a variance between the ownership of the property as laid in the indictment and as shown by the proof. We cannot agree with counsel in this contention. We think the circumstances related above show that the money charged <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>to have been stolen was constructively, at least, in the possession of the J. B. Ford Company. It undoubtedly shows that a voucher for the amount of the money was issued to that company by the Board of Control, as required1 by statute. Then this voucher was filed with the Auditor of the State, and he duly issued his warrant for the amount on the State Treasury, as he was required to do by the statute.</p>

He was not authorized to cash the warrant or in any manner to use it. His act in cashing the warrant, then,'constituted a wrongful conversion of it, and his appropriating the money which he received on it to his own use, together with other circumstances, showed that he intended to take the money under such circumstances as to commit larceny.</p>

He had no authority to have the warrant delivered to himself for the corporation. He cannot take advantage of his own wrong and escape the penalties of the statute by saying that the warrant was never delivered to its rightful owner. The fact remains that he took possession of it after it had been rightfully issued, and procured the money on it at the office of the State Treasurer. His wrongful act in this respect constituted a constructive delivery to the rightful owner of the warrant, and his conversion of the money collected on the warrant constituted a wrongful taking of it under such circumstances as amounts to larceny. He was never rightfully in possession of the warrant or the money derived by cashing it, and he was not therefore guilty of embezzlement. He rightfully caused the voucher to he issued in favor of the J. B.

But where one had- a horse from a livery stable in London to go to Barnet, the jury were instructed that, when he had accomplished the journey, and also brought the horse back to London, which, under the contract of hiring, he was to do, then if, instead of delivering it to the owner, he ‘ converted it after such return to his own use, he is thereby guilty of felony; for the end and purpose of hiring the horse would then be over.’ And if the hirer intends, when he receives the horse, to convert it to his own use, he thereby commits larceny; to complete which there need be no subsequent act of sale or conversion.”</p>

As we have already seen, the defendant was chairman of the Board of Control. He had charge of making contracts for the various State charitable institutions. It was his duty to pass upon the correctness of,these accounts, and to cause vouchers to be issued to the various persons for the amounts respectively .dne them. The very nature and. character of his office and of the circumstances surrounding the transactions, and relied upon by the State, made proof of similar transactions admissible. His repeated acts of a similar nature might, in the minds of the jury, rebut any presumption of innocence as to one independent transaction. The testimony was admissible in order to show the intent or guilty knowledge on the part of the defendant. Therefore we think the evidence of other similar iransactions was admissible, subject to proper instructions as to the purpose of such testimony. In this connection it may be said that the instructions given by the court properly restricted the testimony to other transactions of a similar nature, and the court also told the. jury that it must believe beyond a reasonable doubt that <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>the defendant was guilty in regard to the transactions shown in the indictment. <em>Nash </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/120/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="120 Ark. 157" data-case-ids="1561028" data-case-paths="/ark/120/0157-01">120 Ark. 157</a>; <em>Bledsoe </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/130/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="130 Ark. 122" data-case-ids="8718230" data-case-paths="/ark/130/0122-01">130 Ark. 122</a>; <em>Monk </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/130/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="130 Ark. 358" data-case-ids="8720381" data-case-paths="/ark/130/0358-01">130 Ark. 358</a>; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/156/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="156 Ark. 9" data-case-ids="1358466" data-case-paths="/ark/156/0009-01">156 Ark. 9</a>, and <em>Cain </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/149/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="149 Ark. 616" data-case-ids="8722115" data-case-paths="/ark/149/0616-01">149 Ark. </a><em><a href="/ark/149/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="149 Ark. 616" data-case-ids="8722115" data-case-paths="/ark/149/0616-01">616</a>.</em>

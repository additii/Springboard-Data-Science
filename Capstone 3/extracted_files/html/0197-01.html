The informant, who feared retaliation by Reis, declined to provide any additional information. Calabrese later drove through Shorewood and was able to observe six marijuana plants growing on the back porch of a home. He then observed an individual tending those plants.

During that arrest, officers discovered a large marijuana grow operation in the basement, as well as a rifle and $18,000 cash hidden in the attic. Additional searches of Reis’s financial records in 2005 connected him to a large marijuana grow operation in California.

Laws of 2011, ch. 181, at 1376 (governor’s veto message). She vetoed section 901, which would have established and monitored a state-licensed medical marijuana registry, but did not veto references to section 901 in the amended MUCA. As a result of the governor’s choice not to veto references to the registry, these references remain in the bill, codified as chapter 69.51A RCW. Therefore, we must analyze the effect that Governor Gregoire’s veto has on the remaining references to the vetoed sections. Specifically, we must address the references to a state registry.</p>

The act is “ £to be considered now just as it would have been if the vetoed provisions had never been written into the bill at any stage of the proceedings.’ ” <em>Shelton Hotel Co., </em>4 Wn.2d at 506 (quoting <em>State ex rel. Stiner, </em>174 Wash, at 408). Reis relies on these cases, as well as <em>Washington Federation of State Employees v.

But this case differs from <em>Hallin, Shelton Hotel Co., </em>and <em>Washington Federation </em>in one major way: in those cases, the disregarded language was actually vetoed; in this case, the references to the registry were never vetoed from RCW 69.51A.040. Since the references to section 901 were not vetoed from RCW 69.51A.040, we cannot disregard them. Accordingly, we reject Reis’s argument that the medicinal use of cannabis is no longer a crime.</p>

      <em>Id. </em>at 544.

In exercising the veto power, the governor is acting in a legislative capacity. <em>Shelton Hotel Co., </em>4 Wn.2d at 506. This court does not have the authority to read language out of a statute, even when we believe that the statute contains errors or inadvertent omissions. <em>Cf.

The governor’s veto did not eliminate the statutory language requiring registration in RCW 69.51A.040, and we cannot eliminate that language ourselves.

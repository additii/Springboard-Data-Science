Wash Ballard died, and M. C. Armstrong was appointed guardian of the minor children. On May 11, 1891, Armstrong filed a final settlement of his guardianship of John Ballard, <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>the oldest of the children, who had then, come of age; but it does not appear that he ever made final settlement of his guardianship of the three younger children. In 1884 Armstrong, as guardian, filed a suit for the partition of the land owned by the Ballard brothers, and in' the decree rendered in that cause a tract of land on the east side of the southeast quarter, containing 55.35 acres, was apportioned to the “Wash Ballard children.</p>
    <p id="b375-3" data-blocks='[["BL_375.4",375,[204,787,1203,1117]]]'>On June 12, 1893, there was a sale of a tract of land, described as “Und. 1-3 southeast quarter section 33 * * * ,” for the taxes of 1892. This sale was made to J. D. Shulte, who assigned his certificate of purchase to W. P. Fletcher, who, upon the expiration of the period of redemption, received a tax deed therefor. On December 21, 1896, Fletcher conveyed an undivided half of the undivided third southeast quarter section 33 to Julia Cleveland, Irene Ellis and Emanuel Ballard. Jeff Cleveland paid the purchase price to Fletcher and had the deed made to Julia, his wife, and to Irene Ellis, who was Julia’s niece and a minor, and to Emanuel Ballard, a brother of his wife, who was also a minor. Julia Cleveland was a daughter of Wash Ballard by his first wife, and on her death she was survived by two sons, whose names are Ben and Grover. On December 16, 1898, Fletcher conveyed to Armstrong an undivided half of an undivided 1-3 southeast quarter of section 33. Armstrong had been in possession of the land as guardian of the minor children, 'and after the deeds from Fletcher were executed Armstrong and Cleveland shared the possession jointly.</p>

On of the questions of fact in the case is the identity of Fannie Ballard and Rosie Johnson, and, if the same person, whether she was the only child of Emanuel Ballard. AVithout reviewing here the testi<a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>mony on this issue, we affirm the finding of the court below that Eosie Johnson is Fannie Ballard, and was the only child of her father, Emanuel Ballard. Eosie Johnson’s mother probably had other children after the death of Emanuel; but that is unimportant, as the inheritable blood was on the part of the father, and not that of the mother.</p>

Irene Ellis, another niece of Julia Cleveland, was also taken into Julia’s home as a member of her family and reared by her. Irene Ellis was one of the three grantees in the deed from Fletcher dated December 21, 1896. Irene Ellis was the daughter of a child of Wash Ballard by his first wife, and Irene’s ancester took no interest in the lands because Wash Ballard had conveyed his interest in the quarter section to his children by his second wife.</p>

Fannie Ballard was about three years old at that time, and Irene Ellis was also a minor. J. C. Boyd, an attorney, was appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>to represent these minors. Boyd also represented Julia and Jeff Cleveland, and was allowed a fee of fifty dollars by the court, which was declared a lien on the land. Partition of the land was made in kind, and the north half was <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>given to Armstrong and the south half to Julia Cleveland and the other defendants. The fee allowed Boyd was not paid, and he 'caused an execution to be issued on the judgment, and in January, 1906, the.south half was sold under this execution, and Boyd himself became the purchaser. Later, after obtaining the sheriff’s deed, Boyd executed a quitclaim deed to Jeff Cleveland for the land thus purchased for the recited consideration of one dollar. Jeff and Julia Cleveland died, and their children, Ben and Grover, executed a quitclaim deed to their interest in the land to W. H. McLaughlin and to J. P. ICerby.</p>

This fee was not paid, and at a sale under an execution which issued on this judgment T. C. Trimble, Jr., who was not then a member of the firm of Trimble &amp; Robinson, became the purchaser, and, by mesne conveyances from T. C. Trimble, Jr., this north half was conveyed to J. H.

Moreover, it may here be said that the description now under review was bad because it appears that in 1884 this quarter section was actually partitioned in a suit brought by Armstrong, as guardian, for that purpose, and therefore the interest of the Wash Ballard heirs was not an “undivided” interest.</p>

Cleveland took the deed from Fletcher to' his wife and to Irene Ellis and to Emanuel Ballard. Julia was a child by Wash Ballard’s first marriage, and Irene Ellis was the daughter of another child by Wash Ballard’s first wife; and Emanuel Ballard was Julia Cleveland’s brother. Irene and Emanuel were at the time both minors, and both were then living with Julia Cleveland as members of her family. Upon Emanuel Ballard’s death, Julia took Rosie, his infant daughter, into her home, where she lived as a member of Julia’s family until her marriage in 1913.</p>

This is not true because the trust relation on the part of Julia and Jeff continued down at least until the time of Rosie’s marriage in 1913, until which time she had lived on the land with her uncle and aunt, and the bar of the statute could not have fallen between that date and December 21, 1916, the date of the institution . of this suit.</p>

It is this 55.35-acre tract which forms the subject-matter of this litigation, and that land was embraced in the tract described in the deed from Wash Ballard. We do not know what showing was made in the suit for partition brought by Armstrong back in 1884; but we do know that the land now in litigation was assigned to Armstrong’s wards; and we also know that this land was included in Wash Ballard’s deed, although that deed conveyed about five acres more land than was assigned to Armstrong’s wards.</p>

Boyd a fee of $50 for his services in that case; and as the fee was not paid an execution issued and the whole half interest there assigned to the defendants in that case was sold, at which sale Boyd became the purchaser. Later Boyd received a sheriff’s deed, and thereafter conveyed to Cleveland, whose heirs, upon the death of their ancestor, conveyed to McLaughlin and to Kerby. But the sale to Boyd was void for the reason that he was the guardian <em>ad litem </em>of the infant defendants; and by sec. 8115, C. &amp; M.

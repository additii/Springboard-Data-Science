(NWTS) based on its conduct as the trustee during foreclosure. Lyons alleged violations of the deeds of trust act (DTA), chapter 61.24 RCW; violations of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA), chapter 19.86 RCW; and the intentional infliction of emotional distress. First, this case asks whether a plaintiff can even bring a cause of action for damages under the DTA or the CPA in the absence of an actual sale of the property. It then asks whether the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of NWTS on all three claims. We affirm the trial court’s grant of summary judgment on the DTA and the intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, but we reverse and remand the CPA claim to the trial court.</p>

This beneficiary declaration asserted, “Wells Fargo Bank, NA, as Trustee for Soundview Home Loan Trust 2006-WFI is the actual holder of the promissory note or other obligation evidencing the above-referenced loan or has requisite authority under RCW 62A.3-301 to enforce said obligation.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 120.

On March 30, 2012, while Lyons was waiting for a response regarding her application for a modification, she received a notice of trustee’s sale from NWTS informing her that her property was scheduled to be sold on July 6, 2012. On April 5, 2012, Wells Fargo told Lyons’ attorney that the in-house modification had been approved. On April 19, 2012, Lyons received the letter confirming the modification. The terms required her to pay $10,000 by May 1, 2012. Wells Fargo informed Lyons they would discontinue the sale upon receipt of this payment. She paid this amount to Wells Fargo as required.</p>

This was to become effective on May 1, 2012. NWTS received notice of the sale and service release on April 12, 2012. Lyons received notice of this sale on April 26, 2012.</p>

On June 11, 2012, Lyons’ attorney again called NWTS to inform them of the loan modification and the sale of the loan. An NWTS employee informed her that Carrington had directed NWTS to continue with the foreclosure sale as scheduled. On June 14,2012, Lyons’ attorney called Carrington and an employee indicated that Carrington did not show the property in foreclosure status. Another employee further indicated that Carrington had not told NWTS to go forward with the sale. Lyons’ attorney then sent a cease and desist letter to NWTS and Carrington.</p>

In March 2012, Lyons arrived home to be handed the notice of trustee’s sale by a family member of one of her full pay AFH clients. In addition to the sense of humiliation Lyons felt, this client moved out approximately two weeks later because of concern that Lyons was going to lose her business and her home. Before leaving, this client shared her belief that the home was going to be foreclosed on with other AFH clients, some of whom also moved shortly thereafter. The AFH business is her primary source of income, and the loss of clients directly impacted her financially. In her declaration, Lyons asserts that thereafter she struggled with day-to-day tasks and felt hopeless. She began counseling with the pastor of her church. Her pastor said that previously Lyons was a very positive woman with a drive to succeed, but since the pending foreclosure she was fearful and depressed. Lyons asserts that she experienced constant nausea from the stress and continuously worried about losing her business and the subsequent homelessness of herself, her son, and the elderly clients she cared for.</p>

All of these claims are supported by the same underlying conduct that Lyons alleges involves a violation of RCW 61.24.030(7) in relation to the beneficiary declaration and a breach of the duty of good faith under RCW 61.24.010(4). The trial court focused on the issue of whether Lyons could bring a claim for damages under the DTA in the absence of a trustee’s sale, and there was almost no discussion of the CPA or the <a id="p784" href="#p784" data-label="784" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*784</a>intentional infliction of emotional distress claims during argument on the summary judgment motion.

This court carefully considered the language of the statute, the intended beneficiaries of the statute, the explicit and implicit legislative intent, and the purposes of the statute.

Trustees have obligations to all of the parties to the deed, including the homeowner.” <em>Bain, </em>175 Wn.2d at 93. This duty requires the trustee to remain impartial and protect the interests of all the parties. “[TJhe trustee in a nonjudicial foreclosure action has been vested with incredible power. Concomitant with that power is an obligation to both sides to do more than merely follow an unread statute and the beneficiary’s directions.” <em>Klem, </em>176 Wn.2d at 791. A foreclosure trustee must “adequately inform” itself regarding the purported beneficiary’s right to foreclose, including, at a minimum, a “ ‘cursory investigation’ ” to adhere to its duty of good faith. <em>Walker, </em><a href="/wash-app/176/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="176 Wash.

Notably, NWTS points out that a beneficiary declaration is not the exclusive manner in which a trustee can satisfy RCW 61.24.030(7). This declaration uses the phrase “or has requisite authority,” and only a holder has the requisite authority to act as a beneficiary under <em>Bain. </em>CP at 118.

On its face, it is ambiguous whether the declaration proves Wells Fargo is the holder or whether Wells Fargo is a nonholder in possession or person not in possession who is entitled to enforce the provision under RCW 62A.3-301. But NWTS, as trustee, can still prove that Wells Fargo was the owner of the note in a way other than through the beneficiary declaration referenced in RCW 61.24.030(7)(a).

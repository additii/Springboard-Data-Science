This was done at an adjourned term of the regular May term of the Johnson Circuit Court.</p>

It is claimed that, by reason of this fact, he had no voice in the selection of the jury, and that a court so constituted was and could be no more than a moot court.</p>
    <p id="b1132-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1132.5",1132,[335,941,1202,900]]]'>The record shows that this question was raised for the first time in the motion for a new trial. The statute provides for the manner of the selection of jurors to try cases in the circuit court. By going to trial without objecting to the manner in which the jury was impaneled, appellant must be deemed to have waived any irregularities in the order of selecting the jury. In support of this contention he cites, the case of <em>Dixie Culvert Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Perry County, </em><a href="/ark/174/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="174 Ark. 107" data-case-ids="8718785" data-case-paths="/ark/174/0107-01">174 Ark. 107</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=294%20S.W.%20381" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="294 S.W. 381">294 S.

It had nothing to do with the question now before us. See also <em>Polk County </em>v. <em>Mena Star Co., ante </em>p. 76.</p>
    <p id="b1132-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1132.6",1132,[336,1873,1202,503]]]'>It is next urged that the case should be reversed for certain remarks made by the prosecuting attorney in his opening’ statement to the jury. An objection by counsel for appellant was sustained by the court, and the prose-, cuting attorney withdrew the remarks from the .jury. There was therefore nothing on which to base this assignment of error. The objection was sustained and the remarks withdrawn by the prosecuting attorney. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/78/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="78 Ark. 40" data-case-ids="1497298" data-case-paths="/ark/78/0040-01">78 Ark. 40</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20S.W.%2055" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="93 S.W. 55">93 S.

      <a id="p1117" href="#p1117" data-label="1117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1117</a>It is finally insisted that the court erred in permitting the prosecuting attorney to ask the appellant the following questions over his objections:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1133-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1133.5",1133,[218,559,1198,305]]]'>“Q. I will ask you if you are the same Jim Bowlin that was sent to the pen from Newton County, over here, for cutting a preacher up over there?” “Q.

    <p id="b1133-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1133.6",1133,[222,877,1199,609]]]'>Appellant was a witness in his own behalf, and the above questions were asked on cross-examination, and it is well settled in this court that the defendant may be asked on cross-examination about other crimes committed by him, whether he has been in jail, the penitentiary, or any other place that would tend to impair his credibility. These questions were permitted, no doubt, for the purpose of testing the credibility of the witness.

The court has a discretion as to how far propriety will allow this to be done in a given case, and will or should prevent any needless or wanton abuse of the power.

Together these cases hold that prior to custodial interrogation, a suspect must be informed of his right to remain silent and right to counsel and once the suspect invokes his right to counsel, no further interrogation about any offense by any authorities may be conducted until counsel is present or the suspect initiates communication. These cases, however, involved only domestic investigations regarding domestic crimes. At issue is whether the same rule applies when a suspect requests an attorney during an interrogation conducted outside the United States by foreign authorities regarding a foreign crime. Both the trial court and Court of Appeals said it does not. We agree and affirm.</p>

    <p id="b512-4" data-blocks='[["BL_512.5",512,[218,982,1250,1412]]]'>¶4 During their investigation, Canadian authorities discovered that Trochez-Jimenez was a suspect in a homicide in Seattle, Washington, and notified the King County Sheriff’s Office of his whereabouts. Two detectives from the King County Sheriff’s Office traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia, to speak with Trochez-Jimenez. When they arrived at the Vancouver jail, Trochez-Jimenez was being questioned by Canadian authorities. By the time the King County detectives were able to speak to him, TrochezJimenez had been in custody for about six hours. The detectives were aware Trochez-Jimenez had been advised of his right to counsel under the Canadian charter but were unaware that he had requested counsel be provided. They informed Trochez-Jimenez of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, with the help of a Spanish-speaking Canadian police officer and using a standard King County form printed in Spanish, and likened his <em>Miranda </em>rights to those under the Canadian charter. VRP (Aug. 10, 2010) at 94-95; VRP (Aug. 11-16, Oct. 1, 2010) at 11-19, 33-34, 81; State’s Pretrial Ex. 3; State’s Ex. 43, at 2-4. When asked if he understood his right to an attorney, Trochez-Jimenez responded, “ ‘Okay,’ ” signed the written waiver form, and agreed to talk to the detectives. VRP (Aug. 11-16, Oct. 1, 2010) at 90 (quoting State’s Ex. 43, at 3).

The trial court additionally did not credit Trochez-Jimenez’s claim that he had believed his request for counsel to the Canadian authorities applied to the King County investigation when he had been told specifically that he was under arrest for immigration violations, and it was “with regard to those issues that he was advised of his Charter rights and asserted his right to counsel.” <em>Id. </em>at 96-97. Division One of the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that an invocation of a right to counsel made to foreign officials based on a foreign legal source does not trigger the <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Roberson </em>rule to invalidate a subsequent waiver of Fifth Amendment rights. <em>State v.

The court explained that there was no need to extend the <em>Edwards </em>prohibition to encompass foreign interrogations where the reasoning for the <em>Edwards </em>rule does not apply, particularly when “a request for counsel made in connection with a foreign investigation may result only from the American suspect’s unfamiliarity with the foreign legal system and does not necessarily mean that the suspect is unwilling to talk to an American investigator until he has been provided counsel.” <em>Id.; accord United States v.

TrochezJimenez’s situation is not on all fours with these cases insofar as they involve American nationals in foreign custody, but their broader reasoning is on point — protecting the sanctity of Fifth Amendment rights does not require treating a suspect’s invocation of foreign rights as a Fifth Amendment invocation that triggers Edwards’s protection.</p>

Clarity and certainty are difficult to achieve when United States’ officials must refer to foreign law to decide whether a suspect has a right to have counsel present during questioning in a foreign jurisdiction and, if there indeed is a right, whether the suspect has been informed of this right and whether the suspect has invoked it. Only then might the prophylactic concerns of <em>Edwards </em>be implicated. Moreover, if counsel has been requested, it is not clear whether authorities must give <em>Miranda </em>advisements since none have been provided or are instead <em>prohibited </em>from doing so at the risk of coercing the suspect. The <em>Edwards </em>rule was meant to reinforce <em>Miranda, </em>not thwart it. <em>Edwards </em>rests on the assumption of a seamless system under which all agencies are operating under similar rules that require a suspect be at least once advised of his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights. That assumption simply does not apply to foreign authorities operating outside the United States. For these reasons, we decline to extend <em>Edwards </em>to foreign investigations by foreign authorities investigating foreign offenses.</p>

Holt entered into a contract with the duly authorized agent of the appellees for the purchase of a lot with the building situated thereon in the city of Fort Smith, for the sum of $35,000. The property was incumbered by a mortgage which the purchaser was to assume, the balance of the purchase price to be paid in cash with a deposit made at the time of the execution of the contract of $1,000' with Eugene Henderson, agent of the sellers, which sum was to be held by him until the consummation of the sale or to <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>be returned if tbe sellers failed to carry out the contract. In the contract was the following stipulation: “Seller to furnish a warranty deed and abstract showing good merchantable title and property free of incumbrances except as above specified. Purchaser’s attorney shall have at least ten days in which to examine the title prior to closing.” The abstract of title was promptly furnished by the sellers, which was examined by the attorney of the purchaser within the ten days, who gave it as his opinion that the title was defective. After conferring with another attorney who advised that the opinion of the examining attorney should be accepted, the purchaser immediately notified the agent of the sellers that he would not take the property and complete the purchase. Suit was instituted by the sellers in the chancery court in order to remove the objections made by the attorney who examined the title. This suit proceeded to judgment, after which the attorney pronounced the title good, and, the purchaser still continuing to refuse to complete the purchase, an action was instituted against him for specific performance of his contract.</p>

There is a unanimity of opinion as to what constitutes a merchantable title, but courts having that question before them have given various definitions of what is deemed to be such. In all of these, however, in the final analysis a merchantable title is held to be one which imports such ownership as enables and insures to the owner the peaceable control and use of the property as against every one else. It imports something more than a title which might ultimately prove impervious to assault. This court has approved the following definition of a merchantable title: “A marketable title is one that is free from reasonable doubt. There is reasonable doubt when <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>there is uncertainty as to some defects appearing in the course of its deduction, and the doubt must he such as affects the value of the land or that mil interfere with its sale. ” <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em><a href="/ark/63/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="63 Ark. 548" data-case-ids="8724492" data-case-paths="/ark/63/0548-01">63 Ark. 548</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20S.W.%20852" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="39 S.W. 852">39 S.

Suit was instituted in the chancery court of Sebastian County for the purpose of terminating the trust and vesting the title freed from it in the devisees in the will and their descendants, and for partition. One of the original devisees, Edward T. Hurley, had died before the institution of the suit, leaving a widow, Mrs. Lena Hurley, and two children, Edward Thomas Hurley and Hilda Jean Hurley, both of whom were minors under the age of fourteen years at the time of the institution of the suit and the owners of an undivided interest in the estate, and who are still minors. In that suit a decree was rendered terminating the trust, decreeing partition, and appointing commissioners who allotted to the minors a certain portion of the estate and the lot in question to the appellees. The alleged defect in that title was because, as it is claimed, the minor heirs were not properly served with process in that case as appeared from an examination of the original papers and decree. The examining attorney, in his letter to the appellant disapproving the title, said: “The decree shown at sheet A-2 (referring to the abstract) recites that there was proper service of summons on these two minor de<a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>fendants. Bnt, upon examining the return of service of said summons, I find that that recital is not correct. The sheriff’s return of service indorsed on the summons fails to show that the summons was served on the minors in the manner prescribed by the statute. The question raised may be a close question of law. But, in the absence of proper service on the minors, I do not think that the proceedings in said suit and the partition of the property pursuant to said proceedings are binding upon said minor defendants. ’ ’</p>

It is not sufficient to create a reasonable doubt that the owner might be exposed merely to idle litigation, but it must be a reasonable apprehension that the purchaser-taking the title might be subjected to litigation of a substantial nature from which his title might be placed in jeopardy. In determining whether or not reasonable doubt exists, it appears to be the general rule that the opinion of an attorney that the title to property is bad is <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>not sufficient to raise such a doubt, although., as in the instant case, the attorney may he one of admitted standing and ability.

The complaint affirmatively showed that Edward T. Hurley, the father of the minors, was dead, and that Mrs. Lena Hurley was their mother, and in that state of case the law required that a copy of summons be served upon each of them and their mother. There is nothing in the return of the sheriff to indicate that this law was not complied with. On the contrary, the fact is evident that actual service was had on the minors by delivering to each of them a copy of the summons and a copy to their mother, Mrs. Lena Hurley. It is true, the return does not state in so many words that Edward T. Hurley and Hilda Jean Hurley were minors or that Lena Hurley was their mother, but, as a matter of fact, they were minors, and Lena Hurley was their mother, and therefore service was had in substantial compliance with the law, although the officer failed to describe with particularity its method. The return of the sheriff does not contradict the recitals in the decree, but supports and confirms them.

Henderson has already in his possession the amount of his fee, and, since he will not be required to return the money to the appellant, the question as to him is unimportant, and the judgment in his favor will also be affirmed.</p>

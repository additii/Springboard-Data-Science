They tied him up, beat him, and took a number of items from his home. The State charged Holmes and Lindsay with first degree robbery, burglary, kidnapping, and assault, as well as firearm theft. Holmes and Lindsay argued that they did not intend to commit a felony but were instead repossessing things that Wilkey had originally stolen from Holmes.

This ended her relationship with Laurence Wilkey, with whom she had been living in Idaho. Wilkey moved out while Holmes and Lindsay were away on a trip together, and he took several things of value with him. When Holmes returned to an empty house, she called the police. After investigating, the police in Idaho advised her that it was a civil matter and that she should get a civil attorney.</p>

Taking the facts in the light most favorable to the State, though, Lindsay and Holmes entered the house; Lindsay and Wilkey scuffled; and Wilkey got the worst of it and ended up tied up on the floor. He may have been threatened with a gun and beaten with a pipe after he was tied up. Lindsay and Holmes then took a number of things that they claimed belonged to Holmes and left.</p>

As for the remaining, specifically objected-to, comments where the objection was made in the middle of closing, the State argues that even if improper, they did not affect the outcome of the trial.</p>

During one of these incidents, the prosecutor, after being told no one could hear him, stood directly behind Holmes’s counsel and shouted his next sentence very loudly, to the laughter of the jury. Finally, in a later motion for mistrial based in part on the prosecutor’s whispering, the judge stated in denying the motion, “I did tell [the prosecutor] to speak up and he did speak up, and I thought he repeated everything that he said in a voice that everybody could hear, and I think that’s what he said on the record.” 97 VRP at 8993.</p>

However, directly after the prosecutor’s closing argument, Holmes’s counsel made a motion for mistrial. In that motion she identified a number of the prosecutor’s statements as improper for the reasons noted above, stating specifically that “he made his personal opinions about the evidence [known] on numerous occasions,” 95 VKP at 8890, and that “he is disparaging counsel, just, you know, egregiously,” <em>id. </em>at 8891. The Ninth Circuit has recognized that a defense counsel entering “objections to the language and tenor of the prosecutor’s closing remarks by way of a mistrial motion after the government finished its summation” is “an acceptable mechanism by which to preserve challenges to prosecutorial conduct in a closing argument in lieu of repeated interruptions to the closing arguments,” and therefore that the ordinary standard for examining prejudice applies. <em>Prantil, </em><a href="/f2d/764/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="764 F.2d 548" data-case-ids="378057" data-case-paths="/f2d/764/0548-01">764 F.2d at </a>555 n.4 (citing <em>United States v.

That disrespect permeated the trial process. Against that background, the prosecutor, in his closing arguments, denigrated defense counsel, misstated the burden of proof, expressed his personal belief as to one defendant’s veracity, and whispered to the jury so that no one else in the courtroom could hear him. There is a substantial likelihood that those actions, in context, affected the jury’s verdict. Given the defendant’s immediate postargument motion for mistrial, there is no need to decide whether a curative instruction could have cured the prejudice.

F. Taylor and S. L. Gliadish against J. L. Williams, A. S. Rogers, H. P. Dunavant, A. G. Brickey, W. T. Ramsey and 'Clinton Fraser. It was alleged in the complaint that the Osceola &amp; Little River Roiad Improvement District No. 1, hereafter called district No..l, was organized under the Alexander road law in the year 1918; that J. L. Williams, A. S. Rogers and H. P. Dunavant are the commissioners of the district and A. G. Brickey, W. T. Ramsey and Olinton Fraser are the assessors; that the district is six miles wide and extends' from the east to the west side of Mississippi County; that, while litigation was pending over the creation of the district, the owners of real property west of Little River organized an improvement district under the Alexander road law covering all the area west of Little River that was embraced in district No. 1. The district thus organized embracing the territory west of the river included all the roads in the territory embraced in district No. 1 west of the river. No roads west of Little River were improved by district No. 1. District No. 1, however, built a bridge over Little River which, to some extent, benefited the lands vrest of Little River, and a small assessment of benefits was placed upon s'aid lands west of the river by district No. 1. District No. 1 issued bonds of the par value of $'278,000 which was approximately 30 per cent, of the assessed value of the real property within said district, and thereafter no additional bonds could be issued without additional legislation; that $278,000 was exhausted in the building of the bridge across Little River, and in grading the principal highway and some of the laterals east of Little River within district No. 1, leaving no funds with which to surface the roads; that because of the peculiar condition of the soil of the roads in district No. 1, the money already expended was a useless waste unless the roads are surfaced; that on the 21st of February, 1925, the General Assembly passed act No. 99, which was a special act, authorizing road district No. 1 <a id="p1200" href="#p1200" data-label="1200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1200</a>to make additional assessment of benefits and to issue additional bonds to improve tlie highways within said district east of Little River; that, at about the time of the approval of act No. 99, the special Supreme Court held that amendment No. 12 to the Constitution wias duly and legally adopted; that on the 27th of March, 1925, the General Assembly passed act No. 215, a general act, which was also designed and intended to give relief to road improvement districts of the character of district No. 1 that had exhausted their funds and only partially completed the work of such districts; that district No. 1, assuming that act No. 99 was unconstitutional and void, proceeded under act No. 215 of the Acts of 1925, after the State Highway Engineer had filed his certificate as provided in § 2 of that act, stating that district No. 1 of Mississippi County could not receive the maximum of federal aid without the benefit of the act; that a majority of the property owners within district No. 1 as a whole, and also a majority of the property owners east of Little River, filed a petition provided fop by both the general and local laws of the Acts of 1925, praying that an additional assessment of benefits be made, and that additional bonds be issued to make the improvement; that, after the district No. 1 had commenced proceedings under this general law to make additional assessment of benefits, and issue additional bonds to surface the roads, the Supreme 'Court held that amendment No. 12 was not properly submitted to the people for ratification, and thus special act No. 99 was put in force; that the procedure provided for in the local statute is substantially the same as that provided in the general statute, except that the local statute provided that the roads west of Little River were not to be improved, and the lands west of Little River were not to be assessed for the additional improvement contemplated in the surfacing of the roads east of Little River; that the commissioners of district No. 1 formulated plans for the improvement of the roads east of Little River, but none west of Little River within district No. 1; that an assessment of benefits had been <a id="p1201" href="#p1201" data-label="1201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1201</a>levied upon the lands east of Little River for the purpose of paying for this improvement; that the assessment of the lands 'west of Little River was merely copied or repeated by the, assessors in making the assessment under the new law, whereas the assessment of benefits made by them under the new law on lands east of Little River is about three times the original assessment of benefits; that this resulted in placing all the .burden of the additional work of surfacing the roads east of the river on the lands within Improvement District No. 1 east of such river; that district No. 1- contains about 60,000 acres of land, 48,000 acres east of Little River and 12,000 acres west of the river; that notice was given of a hearing on the assessment of benefits before the board of assessors, .to be held .September 5, 1925, and all persons within, the, district were given .an opportunity to be heard; that the commissioners of distiict No. l had contracted for the sale of bonds for the purpose of raising, funds to complete the work of surfacing the roads east of Little River and, unless restrained, would issue these bonds, and thus place a cloud upon the title of owners of real property in the district for levies on assessment of benefits to pay the bonds.</p>

They alleged that special act No. 99 of the Acts of 1925 is unconstitutional, and that the acts of. the commissioners and assessors thereunder in an effort to confine the assessment of benefits and improvement of the roads to the lands within district No. 1 lying east of Little River were null and void.

Counsel argue that the provisions of the Alexander road law provide that bonds shall not be issued for more than 30 per cent, of the assessed value of the property in the district, which prevents the making of the improvement contemplated by special act No. 99, since that act did not expressly change the provisions of the Alexander road law as to the 30 per cent, limit of <a id="p1208" href="#p1208" data-label="1208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1208</a>the assessed value of the property. This contention overlooks the fact that the very purpose of the enactment of special act No. 99 was to provide for the issuance of bonds and the making of. improvements in the district that could not be undertaken because of the 30 per cent, limitation fixed by the Alexander road law under which the original district was organized. The. allegations of the complaint show that the amount raised by the issuance of bonds to make the improvement contemplated in the organization of the district was approximately 30 per cent, of the assessed value of the property in the district, and that this money had all been expended. Hence it became necessary, in order to make .the improvements ments provided for under act ,No. 99, as if such purpose tional issue of bonds. The language of the provisions of § § 1,1, 5 and 9 clearly shows that the Legislature intended to provide for an additional expenditure to make the additional improvement contemplated in the district that would, exceed the 30 per cent, limit of the Alexander road law. ■ The language of these sections is as plainly indicative of the legislative purpose to remove the 30 per cent, limit under the Alexander rolad law, and to exceed that limit for ithe making of Hie additional improvements provided for under act No. 991 as if such purpose • had been declared in express words. It was within the power of the Legislature to find, and to provide, that the benefits of the additional improvements contemplated would exceed the original limit of 30 per cent, of the as- • sessed value of the lands in the district and to authorize the commissioners to ascertain and fix the amount of such benefits.

Subject to the constitutional limitation that the cost of the improvement contemplated by act No. 99 shall not exceed the benefits, there is no other limitation in that act upon the power of the commissioners to make the improvement, and, if need, be, to expend the entire amount as shown by the reassessment of benefits in making the additional improvements. <em>See Taylor </em>v. <em>Williams, ante </em>p. 52.</p>

Washington labor regulations allow employees to take short rest breaks “on the employer’s time.” When applied to employees paid by the hour, that means employers must pay employees their regular hourly rate during these brief periods of inactivity. Hourly employees, in other words, remain “on the clock” during breaks under undisputed Washington law.</p>
    <p id="b706-5" data-blocks='[["BL_706.12",706,[200,1254,1248,698]]]'>¶2 To answer the certified questions here, we must interpret “on the employer’s time” and apply the language to agricultural employees who are not paid by the hour but rather by the piece. A piece rate is tied to the employee’s output (for example, per pound of fruit harvested) and is earned only when the employee is actively producing. Thus for employees paid a piece rate, the clock stops during periods of inactivity, however brief. The central issue is whether employers can fold payment for rest breaks, when the clock is stopped, into the piece rate consistently with the mandate that breaks be paid “on the employer’s time.” This phrase appears in the regulation applicable to agricultural employees:</p>
    <blockquote id="b706-6" data-blocks='[["BL_706.13",706,[248,1976,1205,296]]]'>Every employee shall be allowed a rest period of at least ten minutes, <em>on the employer’s time, </em>in each four-hour period of employment. For purposes of computing the minimum wage on a piecework basis, the time allotted an employee for rest periods shall be included in the number of hours for which the minimum wage must be paid.</blockquote>
    <p id="b706-7" data-blocks='[["BL_706.14",706,[202,2309,837,49]]]'>WAC 296-131-020(2) (emphasis added).</p>

      <a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>¶3 We rely on the plain language of that regulation to conclude that employers must pay employees for rest breaks separate and apart from the piece rate. An all-inclusive piece rate compensates employees for rest breaks by deducting pay from the wages the employee has accumulated that day. Hourly employees do not finance their own rest breaks in this way, and requiring pieceworkers to do so strips the phrase “on the employer’s time” of any practical meaning. That same language requires that rest breaks for pieceworkers be paid at least at the applicable minimum wage or the employee’s regular rate, whichever is greater.</p>

    <p id="b707-4" data-blocks='[["BL_707.5",707,[105,1154,1252,867]]]'>¶4 This case began in 2013 when two workers sued Sakuma Brothers Farms Inc. in federal district court on behalf of all seasonal and migrant agricultural workers Sakuma employs (Workers). Sakuma operates a berry farm in Skagit County and hires hundreds of migrant and seasonal workers to harvest its crop each year. These Workers, many of whom speak little English, travel to the Skagit Valley to handpick Sakuma’s strawberries, blackberries, and blueberries. For that work, Sakuma pays a “piece rate” wage based on the Workers’ productivity — e.g., an amount per pound or per box of fruit harvested. The piece rate is the only compensation the Workers receive. As a Sakuma representative testified, “ [I]f the picker is not picking . . . , the picker is not earning money.” Doc. 33, at 7 (Decl. of Marc C. Cote in Supp. of Mot. To Certify Legal Questions to Wash. Supreme Ct.).</p>
    <p id="b707-5" data-blocks='[["BL_707.6",707,[104,2045,1249,320]],["BL_708.1",708,[195,331,1253,432]]]'>¶5 The Workers’ class action lawsuit asserted several state and federal claims arising from Sakuma’s use of piece rate wages. In the only claim relevant here, the Workers allege that Sakuma deprived them of paid rest breaks required by WAC 296-131-020(2), which provides that “[e]very employee shall be allowed a rest period of at least ten <a id="p654" href="#p654" data-label="654" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*654</a>minutes, <em>on the employer’s time, </em>in each four-hour period of employment.” (Emphasis added.) The Workers contend “on the employer’s time” means that Sakuma must pay a wage separate from the piece rate for the 10-minute period they are on break, since no piece rate wages accumulate during that time. Sakuma responds that it sets the piece rate with rest periods in mind and that breaks are therefore “on the employer’s time,” as regulated.</p>
    <p id="b708-3" data-blocks='[["BL_708.4",708,[197,784,1250,697]]]'>¶6 While the case was pending in federal court and after some discovery, Sakuma agreed to settle each of the Workers’ <em>retroactive </em>claims. But Sakuma denied liability and expressly preserved its challenge to the Workers’ <em>prospective </em>claim that “Sakuma must pay for the time piece rate workers spend in rest breaks under WAC 296-131-020(2).” Doc. 27, at 17 (Stipulation of Settlement &amp; Release between Pis. &amp; Def.). Thus the settlement does not affect the Workers’ claim for declaratory relief requiring pay separate and apart from the piece rate for these brief rest periods going forward. The federal district court granted the Workers’ motion to certify to us two questions related to that claim.</p>

And, guiding the analysis here, they agree that to answer the question we must interpret WAC 296-131-020. The Department of Labor and Industries (Department) adopted that regulation in 1990, yet in 25 years no Washington court has defined its scope or applied it to workers paid by piece rate.</p>

And when applied to pieceworkers, the only <em>reasonable </em>interpretation is that “on the employer’s time” requires pay separate from the piece rate. Since the piece rate is earned only while the employee is working (i.e., no pay accrues during rest breaks), the Workers’ rest breaks cannot reasonably be said to be “on the employer’s time” if paid by the piece. The only way to give meaning to the phrase in this context is to require compensation separate from the piece rate for rest breaks. While Sakuma’s suggestion that WAC 296-131-020(2) allows an all-inclusive piece rate is perhaps a conceivable interpretation of the regulation, it is not a reasonable one. <em>Cerrillo, </em>158 Wn.2d at 201 (holding, “ ‘a statute is not ambiguous merely because different interpretations are conceivable’ ” (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Agrilink Foods, Inc. v.

There, we applied the regulation to a collective bargaining agreement that provided a 15-minute break after two hours of overtime work. If employees worked less than two hours of overtime, they received no break. At issue was the employer’s practice of excusing employees just before two hours of overtime, requiring those employees to work continuously for nearly four hours between their afternoon break and the end of their workday. <em>Id. </em>at 845-46.</p>

More than establishing blanket rules, each of those courts looked to the purpose rest breaks serve in light of how rest breaks were used (or not) by the employees in context. Both parties here agree that rest breaks are critical to the health and effectiveness of employees, especially those working long hours outside. Amicus reports that agriculture is one of the most dangerous industries in America, inflicting its workers with high rates of repetitive and environmental injuries. Rest breaks mitigate these dangers by allowing employees to sit, cool down, and rehydrate, and we interpret rest break regulations to further that recuperative purpose. <em>Wingert, </em>for example, held that employees cannot bargain away time for rest, even in exchange for additional pay. And <em>Sacred Heart </em>and <em>Pellino </em>reject payment schemes that <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>incentivize missed rest breaks at the expense of the employee’s health.</p>
    <p id="b713-3" data-blocks='[["BL_713.4",713,[116,455,1264,983]]]'>¶19 Those principles support interpreting “on the employer’s time” in WAC 296-131-020(2) to require rest break pay separate from the piece rate. Sakuma argues WAC 296-131-020(2) permits an all-inclusive piece rate because “the system incentivizes employees by awarding harder-working and more productive workers with greater earnings.” Sakuma Bros. Farms, Inc.’s Resp. Br. on Certified Questions at 25-26. This appears a tacit admission that the current piece rate scheme encourages employees to “work harder” by skipping breaks. That result conflicts with all three of the cases discussed above: it effectively decreases the frequency of employees’ rest periods; it incentivizes Sakuma to employ fewer employees; and it fosters a culture of working through breaks. <em>See Wingert, </em>146 Wn.2d at 852; <em>Sacred Heart, </em>175 Wn.2d at 832; <em>Pellino, </em><a href="/wash-app/164/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="164 Wash.

Following from the plain language of WAC 296-131-020(2), and consistent with case law interpreting Washington’s long-standing labor policy, employers must pay a wage separate from the piece rate for time spent on rest breaks. Given the posture of this case and the settlement agreement releasing the Workers’ claims for retrospective relief, we take no position on the retroactivity of this rule. <em>See Ruiz-Guzman v.

Doc. 44, at 2 (Order Granting in Part Stipulated Mot. regarding Certified Questions to Wash. Supreme Ct.). The parties differ in their proposed answers to this question. The Workers argue for the employee’s average piece rate earnings. They would have employers convert the piece rate by dividing the employee’s weekly piece rate earnings by the number of hours the employee worked, exclusive of rest break time, and pay rest breaks at that de facto hourly rate (the employee’s “regular rate”). Sakuma argues Washington law requires only the minimum wage per hour for pieceworkers, though it admits paying rest breaks for its hourly employees at the employees’ hourly rate.</p>

Of course, the starting point for the calculation is the applicable minimum wage.

For instance, we found no distinction “between regular and overtime hours worked” and held employees were entitled to rest breaks “on the employer’s time” if they worked “regular hours, overtime hours, or a combination of both.” <em>Wingert, </em>146 Wn.2d at 848 (citing WAC 296-126-092(4)). We also recognized that “rest periods constitute ‘hours worked’ ” and held that for the purposes of computing overtime, hours spent resting are treated the same as hours spent working. <em>Sacred Heart, </em>175 Wn.2d at 831. In other words, under WAC 296-126-092(4) all hours worked contribute equally to the employee’s right to a rest break and there is no basis to treat the rate paid for rest breaks “on the employer’s time” differently from the rate paid for other hours worked.</p>

      <a id="p662" href="#p662" data-label="662" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*662</a>¶24 Nothing in WAC 296-131-020(2) suggests “on the employer’s time” means something different to agricultural workers generally or to pieceworkers specifically. In fact, the regulation is entirely consistent with our prior interpretations of “on the employer’s time” when a pieceworker’s average earnings are less than or equal to the minimum wage. Time spent on rest breaks and time spent in active work are both hours worked for the employer and, under the second sentence of WAC 296-131-020(2), are <em>paid at the same rate </em>(the minimum wage). We find no reason to depart from this interpretation when a pieceworker’s average earnings are more than the minimum wage. Paying pieceworkers only the minimum wage for rest breaks and a higher rate for active labor results in the same parsing of hours worked “on the employer’s time” that we rejected in <em>Wingert </em>and <em>Sacred Heart.</em>

    <p id="b716-3" data-blocks='[["BL_716.4",716,[196,1211,1249,855]]]'>¶25 Because all hours worked “on the employer’s time” are treated equally, we hold that WAC 296-131-020(2) entitles pieceworkers to their regular rate of pay for rest break time. To calculate a pieceworker’s regular rate, employers again tally the total piece rate earnings and divide those earnings by the hours the pieceworker worked, but here the divisor excludes time spent resting.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> This formula results in the average rate of pay pieceworkers earn during active production (i.e., their regular rate) and prevents rest break time from being double counted. It is also the formula that Sakuma uses to pay pieceworkers for missed rest breaks, since “it is time [the employees] have already spent” working. Wash. Supreme Court oral argument, <em>Demetrio v.

And we see <a id="p663" href="#p663" data-label="663" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*663</a>no reason to treat missed rest breaks differently from rest breaks provided. The pieceworker’s right to a paid break— whether taken or not — follows from the same regulatory language: “on the employer’s time.” It would be inconsistent to interpret that phrase to mean payment at the employee’s regular rate in one instance and merely the minimum wage in another. Consistency is especially important here to ensure efficient employees are not penalized for taking rest breaks. If rest breaks are compensated at a lower wage than the pieceworker’s regular rate, there is a strong incentive to miss rest breaks. That result frustrates the entire purpose of WAC 296-131-020(2). <em>See Sacred Heart, </em>175 Wn.2d at 832.</p>

This practice was embodied in written employment contracts in which employees agreed (1) that their attendance at orientation would be unpaid and (2) that the terms of employment, including salary, would begin after orientation.

The court found, after hearing all the testimony, that the value of the property was $793, and this finding we do not think is against the preponderance of the testimony, and it is therefore conclusive' on this court. The property was afterwards sold and brought much less than the value fixed by the court, but the kind of property owned by the appellant, at a forced sale under the circumstances in this case, would probably sell for very much less than its real value. The only question to be determined here is whether the appellant had complied with the law requiring him to select the specific articles which he claimed as exempt when his schedule, according to the valuation found by the court, exceeded $500, which he would be entitled to claim as exempt, as he was a married man and the head of a family.</p>

It will be observed that the Constitution and statute allow exemptions in specific articles to be selected by himself not exceeding in value the sum of $500. The circuit court held that, when the value .of the articles in appellant’s schedule exceeded $500, it then became the duty of appellant to select from that list articles whose aggregate value did not exceed $500, and that, because he did not do that, he waived his right to exemption.</p>

There were in force two statutes of exemption, one allowing the debtor certain specific chattels, and also permitting him to select ‘ sixty dollars ’ worth of other property suited to his or her condition in life,’ and a later one exempting certain additional chattels, among them ‘one yoke of oxen, or one horse in lieu thereof, not exceeding one hundred dollars in value.’ Putting the two. together, the court sustained the right of the debtor to select the horse in question.” Thompson on Homestead and Exemptions, 675.</p>

And, as we have already said, there is no statute prescribing what shall be done under circumstances like we have here. All the property that this debtor owned was worth very little, if any, more than his exemptions. According to his judgment, it was worth less than his exemptions. And the subsequent sale of the property seems to justify the debtor’s estimate of the value.</p>
    <p id="b971-3" data-blocks='[["BL_971.4",971,[185,900,1201,357]]]'>In speaking of how exemptions should be claimed, it is said in Thompson on Homestead and Exemptions, 663 : “It is enough if it is made to the levying officer in a way in which he cannot, or ought not to, misunderstand it. ‘Men whose property is levied on are generally under some degree of mental excitement. It is not to be expected that their words should be calmly weighed.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b971-4" data-blocks='[["BL_971.5",971,[185,1273,1203,505]]]'>The officer here could not doubt that the debtor was claiming his exemptions. He was bound to know that he was entitled to at least $500 exempt. The value of the articles claimed as fixed by the court exceeded that amount. Since the debtor had selected the property that, according to the proof taken by the court, exceeded the amount that he was entitled to claim as exempt, it was the duty of the court to allow the debtor or to set apart to the debtor $500-worth of articles claimed as exempt, and to sell the balance only.</p>

And we hold that, when a debtor makes it clear that he is claiming his exemptions and specifies the particular articles that he claims, it is the duty of the court to set aside those articles as exempt, and, if they are in excess of the amount the debtor is entitled to claim, the court should deliver to him as exempt articles not exceeding the value of $500, and sell the balance only.</p>

It denied that it was indebted to appellee as alleged in his complaint. The appellant set up that, after the work was performed by the appellee, he agreed with the commissioners of appellant to <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>receive payment therefor in the sum of $60 per acre, and that appellant thereupon paid appellee the balance due at such price, tó-wit: the sum of $160.60, which amount appellee accepted in full payment of all balance due him.</p>
    <p id="b158-5" data-blocks='[["BL_158.5",158,[298,596,1202,815]]]'>The appellee 'testified that he received a check for $160.60. He stated that there was no one present when he received the check except Colvin, one of the commissioners of the district. Appellee made no agreement with the board while in session to do the work for $60 per acre. He asked Colvin, when the latter gave' him the check, “What about the other $15 per acre?” and Colvin stated he would get the board together later. Later there was a meeting of the board, and they asked the appellee if he could do the work for $60 per acre. Appellee testified that he had been paid at the rate of $60 per acre, and that the work at a reasonable value was worth the sum of $75 per acre, leaving a balance due him of $397.50. The meeting of the board of commissioners to which the appellee referred was after Colvin had given appellee the check and after he had cashed the same.</p>

At a meeting of the board, after the work was completed and approved, and at which the appellee was present, they discussed pro and con what price the appellee should receive for his work. “Finally the commissioners agreed to pay him $60, and he agreed to accept the same, and upon that agreement, knowing the number of acres and the amount of money that heretofore had been paid Mm on the-work, and figuring the number of acres at $60, it left a balance due him of $160.60.” Witness drew a check of the district on the Perry State Bank for the balance shown to be due appellee, and marked on the check “In full for balance due on the contract at the lower end, Est. No. 2.” The check was introduced in evidence and reads as follows: “Pay to B. W.

The court instructed the jury, in substance, that if they found the appellee performed the Avork, and that same Avas accepted by the appellant, he should be paid a reasonable sum therefor, and, if they so found, they should return a verdict in his favor for such amount as they found to be a reasonable compensation for the Avork, after crediting the amount appellant had already paid him. The court' further submitted to the jury the issue as to Avhether or not the appellee had accepted the $160.60 already paid him in full satisfaction of his account or claim against the appellant for the work done.

    <p id="b160-5" data-blocks='[["BL_160.5",160,[318,700,1201,1171]]]'>2. The court did not err in refusing appellant’s prayer for a verdict in its favor. Under the testimony, the issue as to whether or not the appellee accepted the check for $160.60 in full satisfaction of the amount due him from the appellant was one for the jury. The recital in the check itself, to-wit: “In payment of account for balance on clearing contract at lower end, Est. No. 2,” does not show on its face that it was given in full payment and settlement for all the work done by the appellee for the appellant. "While testimony on behalf of the appellant tended to prove that the check was given to the appellee with the understanding that it was in full payment of the balance due him, and accepted as such, the testimony of the appellee was to the contrary. This made the issue for the jury. The check, standing alone, did not evidence a contract between the parties, and parol testimony was competent on the issue as to whether or not there was a contract of accord and satisfaction between the parties. That issue was submitted to the jury under correct instructions, in harmony with the law as announced by this court in <em>O’Leary </em>v. <em>Keith. </em><a href="/ark/134/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="134 Ark. 36" data-case-ids="1573253" data-case-paths="/ark/134/0036-01">134 Ark. 36</a>-41, and cases there cited.

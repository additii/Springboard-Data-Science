Under the nationally recognized, court created “filed rate doctrine,” once an agency approves a rate, such as a health insurance premium, courts will not reevaluate that rate because doing so would inappropriately usurp the agency’s role. However, courts may consider claims that are related to rates approved by an agency but do not require the courts to reevaluate such rates. In most cases, Washington courts must consider Consumer Protection Act (CPA), chapter 19.86 RCW, claims alleging general damages merely related to agency-approved rates. In the case before us, however, the plaintiffs allege that several entities doing business in the health insurance field violated the CPA but request specific damages the award of which would require a court <a id="p939" href="#p939" data-label="939" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*939</a>to reevaluate the reasonableness of health insurance premiums approved by the OIC.

This doctrine provides, in essence, that any “filed rate” — a rate filed with and approved by the governing regulatory agency — is per se reasonable and cannot be the subject of legal action against the private entity that filed it. The purposes of the “filed rate” doctrine are twofold: (1) to preserve the agency’s primary jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of rates, and (2) to insure that regulated entities charge only those rates approved by the agency. These principles serve to provide safeguards against price discrimination and are essential in stabilizing prices. But this doctrine, which operates under the assumption that the public is conclusively presumed to have knowledge of the filed rates, has often been invoked rigidly, even to bar claims arising from fraud or misrepresentation.</blockquote>

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals certified three questions to us regarding this duty under Washington law. In answering these questions, we hold that when a duty is premised on evidence of prior similar acts, a landowner or possessor owes a duty to protect business invitees from third party criminal conduct when such conduct is foreseeable based on past experience of prior similar acts. The prior acts of violence on the business premises must have been sufficiently similar in nature and location to the criminal act that injured the plaintiff, sufficiently close in time to the act in question, and sufficiently numerous to have put the business on notice that such an act was likely to occur. Based on the limited focus of the questions and the briefing, we do not decide the circumstances under which a duty would arise when the duty is based solely on the business’s place or character.</p>

McKown confuses duty, which is a question of law for the court, with the scope of duty, which is ordinarily a question for the trier of fact. This confusion arises because McKown treats the matter of foreseeability in this case — an issue concerning whether the landowner has a duty to protect invitees at all — as if it is a question of fact about the scope of duty that should be decided by the jury. But foreseeability as a question of whether a duty is owed is ultimately for the court to decide. <em>See generally, e.g., </em>William H.

In answer to the Ninth Circuit’s second inquiry, proving acts of similar violence is not the only way for a plaintiff to establish a duty as provided in the <em>Restatement. </em>However, it is the one we focus on here because prior history of violence is really the only basis for liability that the parties meaningfully address and the only one that the Ninth Circuit has asked us to clarify.

The prior acts of violence on the business premises must have been sufficiently similar in nature and location to the criminal act that injured the plaintiff, sufficiently close in time to the act in question, and sufficiently numerous to have put the business on notice that such an act was likely to occur. This prior similar incidents approach best conforms to comment f and, more importantly, assures that businesses will be exposed to liability on this basis only when they have past experience of criminal conduct that makes similar conduct on the business premises foreseeable.</p>

Here, McKown’s briefing acknowledges that section 344 comment f describes three circumstances under which a duty may arise: where the possessor knows or has reason to know that the acts of the third person are occurring or about to occur; where the possessor knows or has reason to know based on past experience that there is a likelihood of conduct on the part of third persons in general likely to endanger a visitor; and if the place or character of the possessor’s business, or his past experience, is such that he would reasonably anticipate careless or criminal conduct by third persons, he may be under a duty to take precautions against it. <em>See </em>Br. of Appellant McKown at 19; <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 344 cmt. f. While McKown argues that consideration of the “place or character” of a business is a distinct, alternative method of establishing reasonable foreseeability of harm, he offers no test, criteria, or parameters regarding how “character” is to be established or assessed. <em>See </em>Br. of Appellant McKown at 19.

Simon reads <em>Nivens </em>too narrowly. Even though the plaintiff in <em>Nivens </em>argued only that “a business generally owes a duty to provide security personnel to prevent criminal behavior on the business premises,” 133 Wn.2d at 205, our decision settled more than the bare question of whether a business owes a freestanding “duty” to provide armed guards. Before we could reach Nivens’s specific claim about a business’s alleged duty to provide security personnel, we first had to address the threshold question of whether a business owes <em>any </em>duty to invitees with respect to third-party acts. In the course of resolving this question, we recognized that “in certain circumstances the duty arising out of the special relationship between a business and an invitee described by § 344 of the <em>Restatement </em>may best be met by providing security personnel as part of the reasonable steps to forestall harm to invitees.” <em><a href="/wash-app/52/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="157" data-cite="52 Wash.

The likelihood, or probability, that an event would occur, on the other hand, does not depend on what a reasonable person would have anticipated under the circumstances, but on an assessment of all relevant facts, including those available only in hindsight. Thus harm might be likely but unforeseeable, or foreseeable but unlikely.</blockquote>

An injury is foreseeable if “[t]he hazard that brought about or assisted in bringing about the result [is] among the hazards to be perceived reasonably and with respect to which defendant’s conduct was negligent.” <em>Rikstad v. Holmberg, </em><a href="/wash-2d/76/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="204" data-cite="76 Wash. 2d 265" data-case-ids="1080148" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/76/0265-01">76 Wn.2d 265</a>, 268, <a href="/citations/?q=456%20P.2d%20355" class="citation" data-index="205" data-cite="456 P.2d 355">456 P.2d 355</a> (1969). Or, as we stated in <em>McLeod v. Grant County School District No. 128, </em>“ ‘The sequence of events, of course, need not be foreseeable. The manner in which the risk culminates in harm may be unusual, improbable and highly unexpectable, from the point of view of the actor at the time of his conduct. And yet, if the harm suffered falls within the general danger area, there may be liability, provided other requisites of legal causation are present.’ ” <a href="/wash-2d/42/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="206" data-cite="42 Wash. 2d 316" data-case-ids="5001632" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/42/0316-01">42 Wn.2d 316</a>, 322, <a href="/citations/?q=255%20P.2d%20360" class="citation" data-index="207" data-cite="255 P.2d 360">255 P.2d 360</a> (1953) (quoting Fowler Vincent Harper, A Treatise on the Law of Torts § 7, at 14 (1933)). In other words, while “foreseeable” refers to whether the harm was within the general danger created, “likely” within the context of section 344 refers to whether the actions of a third party actor were probable.</p>

I would adopt the majority’s foreseeability analysis while also requiring that the plaintiff show that the harm was likely. Mere foreseeability is insufficient — the plaintiff must also show that the harm was <em>likely. </em>Such a reading is consistent with public policy and the language and comments to section 344.</p>

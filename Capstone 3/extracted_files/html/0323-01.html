He alleged that an agreement was made between the prosecuting attorney, the court, and appellant, to the effect that all the indictments except the one in this cause should be dismissed against all the defendants upon appellant’s payment of costs in each action, including a prosecuting attorney’s fee of $25 in each case; that no further indictments or prosecutions would be instituted in the judicial district; that appellant would enter his plea of guilty in this particular case, which plea was at said time entered; that he should receive a sentence in the penitentiary of this State for a term of one year, and that, prior to the procurement of said sentence, all the above-mentioned eases should be dismissed, and that the appellant might elect to receive his sentence at an adjourned term of court, 1932, or at the January, 1933, term of said court, at appellant’s option; that at the January, 1933, term of the court, it was published in the newspaper at Harrison that the court did not intend to abide by certain portions of the agreement which had been entered into; that the agreements entered into by the officials of the court have not been performed, and the statements of officials indicated that they did not intend to perform said agreement; that appellant desired to withdraw his plea of guilty; that he Avas innocent of the charge, and entered said plea of guilty solely for the purpose of protecting his friends and former business associates; that he was entitled to withdraw said plea of guilty because, first, said plea was conditional; second, because the agreement, on the part of the court officials, had not been performed or kept.</p>

The appellee selected a publication in Little Bock, known as <em>The Daily Legal News, </em>in which to publish the notice, and this suit was instituted to restrain him from publishing the notice in that paper, on the ground that <em>The Daily Legal News </em>was not a newspaper having a <em>bona fide </em>circulation within the meaning of § 6807 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, providing that all advertisements and orders of publication required by law or order of any court, etc., “shall be published in some newspaper and having a <em>bona fide </em>circulation in the county in which the proceedings are had.”</p>

It is not a subscriber to the Associated Press News, and has no correspondents and reporters outside of the city of Little Rock. It only occasionally publishes news of a general nature, but specializes in news relating to the courts, real estate, statistical news and that concerning business transactions in Pulaski County. It carries notice of incorporation matters filed in the county clerk’s office and the office of the Secretary of State, and publishes a list of marriages and births in Pulaski County, the daily market report, local weather forecast, a list of automobile licenses issued, building permits, and notices of fires occurring in the city of Little Rock. It is published daily excepting holidays and Sundays, and its subscription rate <a id="p750" href="#p750" data-label="750" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*750</a>is $20 per year. It is a four-page publication, 14 xll inches in size, with four columns to each page. It has three hundred and four subscribers confined to business and professional men and associations of that character. It is mailed to twenty cities other than Little Nock and North Little Nock and to eleven other states, and is carried for sale at Peckham’s News Stand on Main Street in the city of Little Nock.

The primary purpose for the printing of legal advertisements and notices of sale of property under orders of a court is to give to the notice the widest publicity practicable. Therefore the definition of a newspaper, within the meaning of the statute, is to be taken In its popular sense, which is one to which the general public would resort in order to be informed of the news and intelligence of the day, and which is published at stated intervals and carries reports of those happenings of general importance and interest to the ordinary individual. <em>Kerr </em>v. <em>Hitt, </em><a href="/ill/75/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="75 Ill. 51" data-case-ids="2701597" data-case-paths="/ill/75/0051-01">75 Ill. 51</a>; <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Allen, </em><a href="/ind/145/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="145 Ind. 584" data-case-ids="1636481" data-case-paths="/ind/145/0584-01">145 Ind. 584</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20N.E.%20646" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="44 N.E. 646">44 N.

In all the cases upon which the appellee relies, the courts, in holding a publication to be a newspaper in which publication of legal notices was authorized, was such a one as carried “literature of a general kind and a limited amount of general news and current events,” and, “besides court proceedings, short telegraphic dispatches of general interest. ’ ’</p>

According to his testimony, during May, 1923, he was working as lineman for the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company in the city of Fort Smith, Ark. His- foreman was named Hare, and drank whiskey. One evening about five o’clock in May, 1923, Hare,told Sand-alin to go to Ninth and G- Streets in Fort Smith, Ark., and buy him a pint of whiskey from a man whom he Would find there. When Sandalin got there, a man walked towards him and asked him if he wanted him. Sandalin asked the man - if he had a pint of whiskey. The man replied that he did, and Sandalin told him to bring it to him between Fifth and Sixth streets on <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>North A Street in about thirty minutes. About thirty minutes later, while Sandalin was standing in an alley between Fifth and Sixth streets, the man and a woman came up to him. The woman had. a package in her hand, and laid it down in Sandalin’s car. He then laid down the money for the whiskey, and she picked it up. He gave her $3 for a pint of whiskey. The defendant was with the woman, but did not say a word. Subsequently Sandalin identified the defendant, John Miller, as the man in question, and Vivian Hubbard as the woman with him. A few days after this transaction took place the sheriff arrested the defendant in a room on the premises controlled by Vivian Hubbard. He found the defendant and two other men in a room together. There was a small glass with a small amount of whiskey in it in the room. In the second room .from that one the sheriff found the top of a fruit jar saturated with whiskey, and just outside of a window of the same room he found a half-gallon jar in a paper sack with some whiskey in the jar. The ground near by was saturated with corn whiskey, where the fruit jar had been thrown out of the window.</p>
    <p id="b495-3" data-blocks='[["BL_495.4",495,[161,1509,1204,244]]]'>The defendant denied selling the whiskey to the prosecuting witness, and introduced other evidence tending to show that he was in the State of Oklahoma at the time Sandalin testified that he bought the whiskey from him.</p>

While counsel for the defendant' insist that the evidence in question shows conclusively that he was in the State of Oklahoma on the date that Sandalin testified 'that he bought the whiskey from him, yet this contention does not take into consideration the evidence of Sandalin. If the jury had believed the witnesses for the defendant, it would have found him not guilty. Having found him guilty, it is evident that the jury believed the testimony of Sandalin and did not believe that of the defendant and his witnesses. The jury had the exclusive right to judge the' credibility of <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>.the witnesses, and the testimony of Sandalin, if believed by the jury, warranted it in finding the defendant guilty -of being interested in the sale of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the statute. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/133/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="133 Ark. 540" data-case-ids="1575081" data-case-paths="/ark/133/0540-01">133 Ark. 540</a>; <em>Snead </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/134/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="134 Ark. 303" data-case-ids="1573310" data-case-paths="/ark/134/0303-01">134 Ark. 303</a>; and <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/152/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="152 Ark. 218" data-case-ids="1364109" data-case-paths="/ark/152/0218-01">152 Ark. 218</a>.</p>

    <p id="b496-6" data-blocks='[["BL_496.6",496,[338,948,1209,703]]]'>It will be noted that the defendant was arrested on the premises of Vivian Hubbard a few days after Sandalin testified that he bought the whiskey from the defendant and Vivian Hubbard. While Vivian Hubbard actually handed the whiskey to Sandalin and received the money for it, the defendant was with her at the time, ■and the sale was completed pursuant to an agreement had between Sandalin and the defendant thirty minutes before this. The evidence was 'Competent as tending to show that the transaction between the defendant and Sandalin was a sale, and that Miller was interested as a seller and not as the mere purchasing agent of Sandalin. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/130/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="130 Ark. 48" data-case-ids="8717658" data-case-paths="/ark/130/0048-01">130 Ark. 48</a>, and <em>Lowery </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/135/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="135 Ark. 159" data-case-ids="1571583" data-case-paths="/ark/135/0159-01">135 Ark. 159</a>.</p>

In other words, in arriving’ at your conclusion on this point, the jury should consider whether it may or may not be true that defendant was present at the time and place the crime is alleged to have been committed, and that some of the witnesses are honestly mistaken as to the exact time they saw the defendant at the time the crime is alleged to have been committed.”</p>
    <p id="b497-5" data-blocks='[["BL_497.5",497,[137,1192,1206,454]]]'>The error pointed out is that the court erred in saying that the jury should scrutinize the testimony of witnesses to see if any of them may not be mistaken as to dates and times when they saw the defendant. The language used does not make the instruction so inherently defective as to make it erroneous and prejudicial to the rights of the defendant, in the absence of a specific objection to it. <em>Bruder </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/110/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="110 Ark. 402" data-case-ids="1337069" data-case-paths="/ark/110/0402-01">110 Ark. 402</a>, and <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/141/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="141 Ark. 43" data-case-ids="1592948" data-case-paths="/ark/141/0043-01">141 Ark. 43</a>.</p>

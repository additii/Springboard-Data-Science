The policy was issued under the industrial plan, and did not require a medical examination prior to its issuance. The application was signed at Stuttgart, Arkansas.</p>
    <p id="b142-9" data-blocks='[["BL_142.15",142,[297,1666,1200,403]]]'>The insured was an inmate of the State Hospital for Nervous Diseases, and it is contended by appellant that he was there as an inmate at the time the application purported to have been signed. The policy is dated in March, 1931. The insured was paroled from the asylum March 20,1931, and was returned in April, 1931, and died there from general paralysis, caused by syphilis, in June, 1931.</p>

It alleges the insanity of the insured at the time the policy was issued, and, as a further defense, pleads a specific <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>provision of the policy that, should the insured die within two years of the date of the policy, and had, before its date, been treated for a serious disease by a physician, the company would only be liable for the amount of the premiums paid, which it alleged was $3.75, and it tendered that amount in court. The appellant also charged that the policy was issued and delivered through fraud of the said insured, and upon false and fraudulent misrepresentations, warranties and statements of the applicant.</p>
    <p id="b143-4" data-blocks='[["BL_143.4",143,[222,844,1199,252]]]'>After the evidence was introduced, attorney for appellant stated that they had pleaded fraud in the answer, but they now waive that, and state that no one perpetrated any fraud in obtaining the insurance on the deceased, Theodore Clemons.</p>
    <p id="b143-5" data-blocks='[["BL_143.5",143,[223,1101,1197,198]]]'>The case was tried before a jury, resulting in a verdict in favor of appellee for the full amount stated in the policy. Motion for new trial was filed, which was overruled by the court, and the case is here on appeal.</p>

Mr. Curling, the agent, said he believed he could, and that he would take it up with the insurance company right away. Curling had been going to Mrs. Dunham’s place for some time, he knew the insured, knew his mother, and knew that he had been in the insane asylum. He also knew that the insured had been seriously injured by falling from the third story of a building in Little Eock, and she told Curling that he was very nervous and had been put in the hospital, and that he had better have him examined. She told him she would keep the premiums paid up, as she had two other ■boys with insurance in the same company, and, after she told him this, he wrote the insurance.</p>
    <p id="b144-3" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[323,1041,1201,648]]]'>It therefore appears from the undisputed testimony that the insured had fallen from the third story of a building, and that the agent knew this, and knew that he had been an inmate in the hospital for nervous diseases, and therefore knew that he had been treated by a physician for a serious ailment. There is no positive evidence that the agent knew he had syphilis, and the probability is that the insured himself did not know what his ailment was. The mother of the insured appears not only to have told him all she knew about the physical and mental condition of the insured, but she told the agent, after telling about his injuries and ailments, that he had better have him examined.</p>

After the agent knew these things, he did not ask the insured any questions about his health or about doctors, and he did not ask the mother any questions about the insured’s health. The agent himself wrote the application, and the insured signed it, but did not read it. The answers in the application were written by the agent, and not by the insured. The application was signed, and <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>Mr. Curling delivered the policy later. The insured was working about the hotel, which belonged to Alma Dunham.</p>

    <p id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.6",145,[198,964,1213,400]]]'>It is true that the insured was treated before the date of the policy for a serious complaint by a physician, but it is also true that appellant’s agent knew of his falling, and of his treatment in the insane asylum. Mrs. Dunham was asked if she knew whether or not a year before that time, or longer, he was afflicted with syphilis.^ She answered that she did not know, but she knew and told the insurance agent that he had been hurt.</p>
    <p id="b145-7" data-blocks='[["BL_145.7",145,[193,1371,1206,608]]]'>It conclusively appears that, at the time the application was taken, and at the time the policy was delivered, appellant’s agents knew that the insured had had a serious complaint, and that he had been treated at the Hospital for Nervous Diseases. If the insurance company knew before the date of the application that insured had been attended by a physician for any serious disease or complaint, whether it knew what the specific complaint was or not, would make no difference. The insurance company did know that he had been attended by a physician for a serious disease, and, if it wished to know what specific complaint, it should have made inquiry.</p>
    <p id="b145-8" data-blocks='[["BL_145.8",145,[190,2001,1201,344]]]'>The record shows that the agent who wrote the application and delivered the policy knew the condition of the insured; knew that he had been in the hospital, and knew that he had had a fall from a third story of a building, but he did not ask the insured any questions, but wrote the application himself with a knowledge of all the facts detailed above.</p>

The undisputed evidence also shows that the agent brought this policy to the insured and said, at the time, that it was for $435, and that it was all right, and they relied on what he said.</p>
    <p id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[337,1492,1201,451]]]'>It is apparent that the insured and his mother were led to believe by the agent that they were getting a policy for $435.

The agent brought it and said it was for $435.</p>

They are prepared by one party to the contract, and the other party thereto has no opportunity to deal with his contractor as to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the contract. The only option open to him is to contract or not to contract, and when he contracts it is upon terms <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>prepared in advance by tbe other party, and reduced to printed form, which is sought to be as unchangeable as the laws of the Medes and Persians.</p>

Can one party to a contract thus prevent himself being bound by the ordinary principles governing principal and agent? If a man sends forth an agent and clothes him with authority to do certain acts, his acts within the scope of that authority are binding- upon the principal; and moreover, if he clothes him with apparent authority to do certain acts, and privately instructs him to the contrary, and the agent proceeds to do those acts within the apparent scope of his authority, but contrary to his private instructions, still the principal is bound. When an agent does anything within the real or apparent scope of his authority, it is as much the act of the principal as if done by the principal himself.” <em>People’s Fire Ins.

He wrote the application himself. He not only knew these facts, according to the evidence of appellee, and knew that the insured was insane, but he knew that the mother with whom he dealt did not read the policy, and probably would not have understood it if she had. And these parties were informed, and the agent of the insurance company was bound to know that they believed, that the insurance policy was for $435, and that this amount would be payable upon the . death of the insured.</p>

Dunham, the husband of Alma Dunham, but this <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>was excluded from the jury. He was acting as agent in paying the insurance premiums, and, since he was paying the premiums as agent of the insured, the statement of the agent was competent. Dunham stated that he asked the insurance agent if the insurance was any good, and he said, if the hoy should die that night, his mother would get every dollar of it, and witness then paid him the premium.</p>
    <p id="b148-3" data-blocks='[["BL_148.4",148,[323,837,1201,605]]]'>Appellant states that, since the defense of fraud was waived, the sole defense was the limitation in the policy. If the insurance agent, knowing the facts detailed above, procured the application and delivered the policy, after having led the insured to believe that he was getting a policy for $435, this would constitute a waiver of the limitation in this policy. This, however, is a question of fact for the jury under proper instructions, and it is for the jury to determine whether there was a waiver or» an estoppel. If there was, plaintiff is entitled to recover. If there was not, then she is entitled to recover $3.75 only.</p>

    <p id="b148-5" data-blocks='[["BL_148.6",148,[325,1860,1199,536]]]'>Appellant next contends that the instructions are erroneous and conflicting. The instructions are in conflict, but we think it is unnecessary to set them out here. The only question, so far as this record is concerned, is whether the insurance company waived the provision in the policy, or is estopped from setting it up, and, as we have already said, these are questions of fact for the jury. There will be no difficulty in the trial court’s properly instructing the jury when the case is tried again.</p>

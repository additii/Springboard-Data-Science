A high number of documented criminal incidents occurred in the area of this apartment building, including drug-related activity. Because of the high incidence of crime, the owner of the complex gave the King County Sheriff’s Office signed, written permission to investigate people who loiter on the property. The officer testified, however, that a person did not commit a violation merely by visiting an apartment. The officer knew the apartment building and its tenants well because the building was deemed part of a “Problem Solver project,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which resulted in the officer regularly patrolling the complex. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Jan. 3, 2013) at 14-15. The officer patrolled the complex for four months, and consequently, he knew the tenants and knew the vehicles that they owned. He also knew that four of the tenants had convictions for drug-related crimes — either possession or possession with intent to distribute.</p>

The officer asked the driver what he was doing there. The driver said he was there because his friend called him for a ride. The driver, however, did not explain why he slumped down as the officer drove by. The officer then waited on the passenger side of the vehicle. He observed Steven Sandoz leaving the apartment of Jennifer Meadows, who the officer knew had a conviction for possession of narcotics with intent to distribute. Over the course of four months, the officer had seen approximately 60 people coming and going from her apartment but observed none on the evening in question.</p>

The apartment belonged to Richard Fenton. In November 2010, 11 months before, police made controlled purchases of methamphetamine from Fenton. Police subsequently executed a search warrant on the apartment, where they found methamphetamine and related materials. Police suspected that Fenton was still selling narcotics based on recent interviews with individuals arrested for narcotics-related offenses.</p>

The word “loiter” is undefined in the statute. <em>See </em>STMC 8.05.380; RCW 69.50-.101.

Sandoz did not remain idle: he left the apartment and walked immediately to the Jeep without stopping. Although the individuals in the Jeep may have loitered, that issue is not before the court. Similarly, Sandoz did not appear to trespass: he entered a tenant’s apartment, stayed inside at least 15 minutes without any known discord, and left directly to the Jeep.

Here, in addition to short-stay traffic, officers could reasonably infer that Fuentes participated in the ongoing drug transactions: Fuentes entered the apartment briefly, then returned to her car. She then carried a plastic bag into the apartment, and she left with a bag that had noticeably less content. Her stay lasted approximately five minutes. From these observations, officers could form a reasonable suspi<a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>cion that Fuentes made a delivery at the apartment.

The trial court made 32 findings <em>of </em>fact relating to the officers’ search and seizure of Fuentes.

Majority at 156 (citing Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Feb. 29, 2012) at 9-10). The record suggests that warrant was issued in November 2010. Fuentes was arrested in October 2011, 11 months later.

    <p id="b221-4" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[92,683,1258,750]]]'>¶47 But even if Fuentes’s visit to an apartment building while carrying a grocery bag alone could justify the stop, I find it remarkable that officers did not seize Fuentes either at that time or right after she left the immediate area. Instead, she was followed by different officers than the ones who observed her at Fenton’s home (who seem to have lost sight of her for some time) and stopped as she was about to pull into the driveway of a home where her boyfriend, among others, was in the front yard. Nothing in the record suggests anything happened that would warrant police attention from the time she drove away from the first home until she pulled into the driveway at the second, and the judge noted specifically that she was not stopped for a traffic infraction.</p>

In <em>Kennedy, </em>a police officer was investigating complaints from neighbors regarding high levels of traffic at Rob Smith’s home. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Additionally, that officer had received a tip from a reliable informant “that Michael Kennedy regularly purchased marijuana from Smith, that Kennedy only went to Smith’s house to buy drugs, and that Kennedy usually drove either a light green pickup truck or a maroon Oldsmobile.” <em>Id. </em>That officer was driving by Smith’s house when he saw a maroon Oldsmobile parked nearby. He stopped and saw Kennedy leave the house, get into the Oldsmobile, and drive away. <em>Id. </em>The officer pulled Kennedy over, saw him “lean forward as if to put something under the seat,” and asked him to step out of the car. <em>Id. </em>The officer found marijuana under the seat. <em>Id. </em>at 4. We found the officer had “sufficient <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>articulable suspicion to stop Kennedy as he drove away from the Smith house.” <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>
    <p id="b222-4" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[194,455,1249,742]]]'>¶49 In contrast, nothing in the record before us suggests the officers had an informant’s tip that Fuentes was buying or selling drugs herself at Fenton’s home or that she went to Fenton’s home only for such purposes. Nor, unlike Kennedy, did she appear to secrete anything in the car when stopped. <em>Kennedy </em>is not an apt analogy. Instead, this case is much more like <em>Doughty. </em>Doughty, like Fuentes, made a brief stop late at night at a house that was under surveillance. 170 Wn.2d at 60. Shortly after and by the same officer who had observed him at the house, he was stopped, searched, found to be in possession of drugs, and arrested. <em>Id. </em>We found that the State had failed to show “sufficient specific and articulable facts” to justify the seizure and suppressed the fruits of the search. <em>Id. </em>at 65.</p>
    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[197,1220,1249,480]]]'>¶50 The majority makes much of the fact that Doughty was not seen to have anything in his hands, while Fuentes did. I do not find this fact persuasive. First, we noted in <em>Doughty </em>that the most persuasive element in <em>Kennedy </em>was the reliable informant’s tip, not the fact the defendant’s hands were empty. <em>Id. </em>at 64 (citing <em>Kennedy, </em>107 Wn.2d at 6-8). Second, people often carry small things in their hands, from phones to footballs. This is, at best, only weakly suggestive of criminal behavior.</p>

I find the State has not met its burden of establishing officers had specific and articulable facts, individualized to the defendants, that gave rise to a reasonable suspicion in either case. To the extent the majority finds that it has, I respectfully dissent.</p>

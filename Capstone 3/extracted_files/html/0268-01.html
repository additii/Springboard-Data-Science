Rose had worked as a truck driver for over 30 years, the last 3 of which he worked as an employee for Anderson Hay. His position required him to drive loads of hay weighing 50 tons or more from Ellensburg to ports located in Western Washington. Rose operated under federal regulations that required him to drive no more than 60 hours per week. <a href="/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20395.3" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="49 C.F.R. § 395.3">49 C.F.R. § 395.3</a>(b)(1).</p>

When it was first analyzed in <em>Thompson, </em>we recognized it as an exception to the general principle that absent a definite contract, employees are terminable at will. The purpose of the tort exception is to prevent employers from utilizing the employee at-will doctrine to subvert public policy—we said, “[T]he common law doctrine cannot be used to shield an employer’s action which otherwise frustrates a clear manifestation of public policy.” <em>Thompson, </em>102 Wn.2d at 231.

In evaluating Thompson’s claim in review of dismissal on summary judgment, we embraced a burden-shifting analysis in which the analytical focus was whether the employee could establish that the discharge clearly contravened public policy:</p>
    <blockquote id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[247,1681,1201,439]]]'>The employee has the burden of proving his dismissal violates a clear mandate of public policy.

Particular to this tort, however, we insisted that the public policy at issue be judicially or legislatively recognized, emphasizing that the tort is a narrow exception to the at-will doctrine and must be limited only to instances involving very clear violations of public policy. Thompson’s requirement that the policy be judicially or legislatively recognized protects employers from having to defend against amorphous claims of public policy violations and addresses the employers’ legitimate concern that a broad common law tort would considerably abridge their ability to exercise discretion in managing and terminating employees. This strict clarity requirement ensures that only clear violations of important, recognized public policies could expose employers to liability.</p>

In that case, several at-will employees were injured on the job and were forced to continue working under threat of termination. The Industrial Insurance Act (IIA), Title 51 RCW, prohibits such coercion and provides an administrative remedy for employees who are terminated in retaliation for <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>taking leave for work-sustained injuries. When we examined the IIA as an alternative remedy to the tort claim, we examined whether it was a mandatory and <em>exclusive </em>remedy such that it precluded the plaintiff from recovery through a wrongful discharge tort claim. We concluded that the statute contained permissive rather than mandatory language, and we held that an aggrieved employee could seek recourse under either claim.

The dissent responded that Gardner could have summoned help by using his radio or sirens, reasoning that those other alternatives would have been adequate and that Gardner’s actions were unnecessary to save her life. What is important about this case is this court’s treatment of the adequacy component. Clearly, at the time of <em>Gardner, </em>the focus of the adequacy analysis was whether the employee had adequate alternatives <em>at the time </em>the employee decided to violate the employer’s policy; the analysis did not involve a review of other after-the-fact remedies that might be available.</p>

If so, we reasoned that public policy would not be jeopardized because the statutory remedy already protected that interest. But we ultimately decided that the alternative statutory remedy was inadequate because it provided third parties only a roundabout way of challenging these administrative decisions. We determined that availing the common law remedy to employees who report violations was a better and more efficient way of ensuring compliance with the law, and we allowed the claim to proceed.</p>

The claim in <em>Cudney </em>involved an employee who was terminated for reporting a managerial supervisor for driving the company car while intoxicated. We affirmed the summary judgment dismissal of Cudney’s claim because the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act of 1973 (WISHA), chapter 49.17 RCW, provided for all appropriate remedies for workers who report safety violations. We went on to explain that state driving while under the influence laws also protected the public policy at issue and that the wrongful discharge tort was therefore not necessary to address the public policy concern. Because the purpose of the tort is to protect public policy, not the individual employee’s rights, we were also unconcerned that the remedies under WISHA were not available to this particular plaintiff. It was sufficient that the administrative remedies were generally available to wrongfully discharged employees.</p>

Under the line of cases decided prior to <em>Hubbard, </em>Rose’s claim would survive summary judgment. We would have reviewed the STAA only for mandatory and exclusive language, in which case the STAA’s nonpreemption clause would satisfy Wilmofs nonexclusivity requirement. But under <em>Hubbard, Korslund, </em>and <em>Cudney, </em>the “strict adequacy” requirement would have foreclosed Rose’s tort claim because the STAA provides similarly robust and comprehensive remedies. The STAA also contains a nonpreemption clause nearly identical to the one at issue in <em>Korslund.

However, <em>Piel </em>would dictate still a different result: since nonpreemption clauses constitute the best possible evidence that the statutory remedies are inadequate, alternative remedial statutes with nonpreemption clauses do not preclude tort claims. The STAA contains such a clause, and under <em>Piel, </em>we would permit Rose’s claim to proceed out of respect for Congress’ choice to avail multiple sources of remedies for STAA violations.</p>

But stare decisis does not compel us to follow a past decision when its rationale no longer withstands careful analysis. When the generalization underpinning a decision is unfounded, we should not continue in blind adherence to its faulty assumption. <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em><a href="/us/556/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="556 U.S. 332" data-case-ids="3653882" data-case-paths="/us/556/0332-01">556 U.S. 332</a>, 351, <a href="/us/556/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="556 U.S. 332" data-case-ids="3653882" data-case-paths="/us/556/0332-01">129 S.

We adopted the adequacy requirement as a means of maintaining the narrowness of the tort exception to the at-will doctrine. And while we agree here that the tort exception must remain narrow, we will not narrow it in a manner that harmfully deprives aggrieved employees of a rightful claim, particularly when it fails to serve any legitimate employer interest. For the reasons below, we conclude that the additional “adequacy of alternative statutory remedies” component of the jeopardy prong is incorrect and harmful. We disavow the requirement that a plaintiff establish inadequacy of alternative remedies and overrule our cases to the extent they hold otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.5",324,[201,1741,1248,630]]]'>¶26 First, our “strict adequacy” requirement is premised on the faulty assumption that it further protects the breadth of our at-will doctrine. For example, Anderson Hay argues that the tort is a narrow exception, and should be construed narrowly, because the at-will doctrine reflects the policy that employers must retain discretion in making employment decisions and the threat of frivolous suits unduly burdens their ability to manage employees. They argue that this “strict adequacy” requirement necessarily limits the availability of the tort, thereby protecting employers’ discretionary authority to terminate employees with or without cause.</p>
    <p id="b325-3" data-blocks='[["BL_325.3",325,[201,345,1248,1421]]]'>
      <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>¶27 This argument is unavailing for multiple reasons. To begin with, the “strict adequacy” requirement does not actually promote employer discretion with respect to at-will employees. Regardless of whether the tort for wrongful discharge would be available to Rose, the STAA prohibited Anderson Hay from terminating Rose for refusing to break the law. The concurrent availability of this tort does not broaden or narrow Anderson Hay’s legal discretion to terminate Rose as an at-will employee. Additionally, by asking us to overlay our exclusivity analysis with an adequacy analysis, Anderson Hay essentially asks us to embrace a stronger at-will doctrine policy protective of its illegal activities. We disagree that Anderson Hay should be allowed to contravene public policy merely because an alternative nonexclusive administrative remedy existed. The purpose of a broad at-will doctrine is to protect the employer’s legitimate need to exercise discretion. Legitimate employer discretion does not include an employer’s illegitimate desire to violate the law in disciplinary decisions without repercussion. If a plaintiff can surmount the difficult burden of establishing that his or her termination contravenes a clear, important mandate of public policy, then the additional strict adequacy requirement only “narrows” the tort by offering a loophole to avoid liability. No legitimate purpose exists for protecting an employer’s ability to violate public policy.</p>

The common law is free standing, and absent clear legislative intent to modify the common law, its remedies are generally not foreclosed merely because other avenues for relief exist. Washington courts have recognized that the wrongful termination tort is independent of any underlying contractual agreement or statute and have previously held that an employee need not exhaust his or her contractual or administrative remedies. <em>Smith v. Bates Tech. Coll., </em><a href="/wash-2d/139/0793-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="139 Wash. 2d 793" data-case-ids="99102" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/139/0793-01">139 Wn.2d 793</a>, 809, <a href="/citations/?q=991%20P.2d%201135" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="991 P.2d 1135">991 P.2d 1135</a> (2000) (teacher not required to <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>exhaust collective bargaining agreement remedies before bringing wrongful discharge in violation of public policy claim); <em>Allstot v.

The common law may be abrogated by constitutional requirements or legislative action, but we do not view the wrongful discharge tort as self-subordinating. Common law remedies should be preempted by statutory law only where the legislature either implicitly or explicitly expresses an intent to do so. It is incorrect to overlay the exclusivity analysis with an additional adequacy analysis.</p>
    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.4",326,[201,1185,1253,1194]],["BL_327.1",327,[202,345,1245,255]]]'>¶29 Third, the jeopardy element, as we described it in <em>Gardner, </em>does not require an analysis into the adequacy of alternative remedies. In <em>Gardner, </em>we analyzed “adequacy of alternatives” by looking at the alternatives available to the employee at the time he or she decided to violate the employer’s direction; we did not address alternative remedial statutes. Moreover, the adequacy of alternatives requirement is inconsistent with the remainder of the jeopardy element. We said the plaintiff establishes jeopardy by demonstrating that his or her conduct was <em>either </em>directly related to the public policy <em>or </em>necessary for effective enforcement. The disjunctive language creates two options for establishing jeopardy, and the plaintiff satisfies the jeopardy element by either means. In the first type of case, where there is a direct relationship between the employee’s conduct and the public policy, the employer’s discharge of the employee for engaging in that conduct inherently implicates the public policy. In the second type of case, where there is no direct relationship, then the plaintiff must establish that his or her actions were necessary for effective enforcement of the policy—in other words, the plaintiff must establish that there was no adequate alternative <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>means of promoting the policy. If we require the plaintiff to argue inadequacy of alternative means in every case, we obviate the plaintiff’s ability to establish jeopardy by establishing either disjunctive. Such a requirement renders the first disjunctive superfluous.</p>
    <p id="b327-4" data-blocks='[["BL_327.4",327,[201,622,1247,671]]]'>¶30 Finally, the adequacy component undermines the very purpose of the tort. When we adopted this tort exception to the at-will doctrine, we sought to encourage employees to follow the law by protecting them from retaliatory termination. The additional adequacy requirement strips employees of that protective guarantee. With the vast number of remedial statutes that exist to address public policies, employees are left to guess whether the law will protect their actions or whether their claim will slip through the cracks formed by this nebulous adequacy standard. In the aggregate, this doubt and uncertainty will erode employees’ trust that the law will protect their lawful actions.</p>
    <p id="b327-5" data-blocks='[["BL_327.5",327,[197,1322,1252,1057]]]'>¶31 Though we reject this adequacy requirement, courts still must consider whether a statutory remedy is intended to be exclusive. A review of exclusivity is a more consistent, clearer, and legislatively deferential standard. It is more consistent with our analysis of all other wrongful discharge torts, all of which embrace the same exclusivity analysis and better reflects the role of the common law in supplementing statutory principles. <em>Smith, </em><a href="/wash-2d/139/0793-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="139 Wash. 2d 793" data-case-ids="99102" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/139/0793-01">139 Wn.2d 793</a>; <em>Allstot, </em><a href="/wash-app/116/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="116 Wash.

Our courts are familiar with analyzing statutes for preemptory and mandatory language, and our well-established jurisprudence would guide the application of this tort toward more consistent, predictable results. And finally, the exclusivity requirement respects the legislature’s choice to either preclude or supplement the common law remedies as it deems necessary. Congress and the legislature know how to create exclusive remedies, and as the popularly responsive branch of government, they are in the best position to determine when such remedies should be restricted in favor of employers.</p>

      <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>¶32 Our continued adherence to this adequacy requirement is both unwarranted and harmful. By requiring a comparison of the relative efficiency between the tort and the numerous statutes that may exist that address the same policy, this adequacy analysis has created confusing and inconsistent precedent. Our court has struggled with its application, and the time has come to reject the requirement outright. The adequacy component narrows the tort in an illogical, inconsistent fashion and does nothing to serve the legitimate interests of the employer. By discarding this additional adequacy requirement, we hope to bring clarity and consistency to the adjudication of these claims.</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[202,993,1246,573]]]'>¶33 For these reasons, we abrogate our precedent only to the extent that it has required an adequacy, rather than an exclusivity, analysis of alternative remedies. We reaffirm the approach we established in <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Gardner </em>as the appropriate analytical framework for the tort. <em>Wilmot </em>applies the proper exclusivity analysis when alternative remedial statutes address the same public policy. Because our cases since <em>Thompson, Gardner, </em>and <em>Wilmot </em>have embraced the same core principles, and in large part remain good law, we abrogate them only to the extent they require an analysis of the adequacy of alternative remedies.</p>

Part of this examination includes an analysis of the statutory language to determine whether the legislature indicated that the statute would be insufficient to adequately promote the public policy at issue.</p>
    <p id="b336-4" data-blocks='[["BL_336.4",336,[202,855,1247,1024]]]'>¶54 The majority asserts that the adequacy of the alternative remedy analysis as it operates after <em>Piel </em>is inconsistent with the jeopardy element as it was described in <em>Gardner. </em>Majority at 284. The majority states that <em>Gardner </em>set forth a disjunctive test that allowed the plaintiff to establish the jeopardy element by demonstrating that his or her conduct was either directly related to the public policy or necessary for effective enforcement. <em>Id. </em>According to the majority, where the plaintiff showed that his or her action directly related to the public policy, he or she does not need to show that there are no adequate alternative remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 284-85. The majority is correct that in <em>Gardner </em>this court set forth a disjunctive test, but that was only a piece of the plaintiff’s burden. The <em>Gardner </em>court also stated that to establish the jeopardy element, the plaintiff must show that other means of promoting the policy are inadequate. 128 Wn.2d at 945. Therefore, it has never been sufficient for the plaintiff to demonstrate that his or her conduct directly relates to the public policy.</p>

Majority at 272. The majority proposes a new framework for the tort that would eliminate the adequacy of the alternatives analysis. Under the majority’s new framework, a trial court examining whether a plaintiff has a claim for the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy must begin by determining whether the facts of the case fit one of the four common factual scenarios. <em>Id. </em>at 286-87. These include where an employee is fired for (1) refusing to commit an illegal act, (2) performing a legal duty or obligation, (3) exercising a legal right or privilege, and (4) reporting employer misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 276 (quoting <em>Gardner, </em>128 Wn.2d at 936). If the facts of the case fit one of the four common factual scenarios, then the court must determine if the employee met his or her burden of proving that his or her dismissal violates a clear mandate of public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 286-87. If the employee can meet this burden, then the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that dismissal was for other reasons. <em>Id. </em>Alternatively, if the facts do not fall within one of the four recognized factual scenarios, then the court should use the four-part test set forth in <em>Gardner. Id. </em>Further, according to the majority’s analytical framework, if a statutory alternative is relevant, it will preclude a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy only if the statute provides an exclusive remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 287. The exclusivity of a statutory remedy can be express or implied. According to the majority, a nonpreemption clause in a federal statute demonstrates that the statute is not exclusive and should not preclude a tort claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. <em>Id.</em>

The purpose of the tort is to protect the interests of the public and to promote public policy. <em>Smith, </em>139 Wn.2d at 801. When examining the jeopardy element where there is a statutory alternative, the question for the court should not be whether the applicable statutory alternative precludes the tort, but whether the statute adequately promotes the public policy such that the tort claim is not necessary. <em>See Korslund, </em>156 Wn.2d at 183. Rejecting the adequacy analysis and focusing on the exclusivity of an alternative statute does not promote public policy. Instead, it may give a plaintiff the opportunity to recover under the tort claim and under the statutory remedy. In addition, the new framework broadens the scope of the tort beyond what was intended in <em>Thompson.</em>

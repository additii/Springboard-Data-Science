Progress on the project slowed when PUD was required to conduct an extensive environmental impact study (EIS). In 2003, PUD and the United States Forest Service (USFS) held a public scoping period, encouraging members of the public, environmental groups, and governmental agencies to assist them in identifying areas of public concern. In 2004, PUD and USFS released a scoping report.

The flaw in DNR’s and CNW’s position stems from a misapprehension of our early cases. As discussed, the analysis for determining a municipal corporation’s authority to condemn state land held by the State in its governmental capacity is similar to that for determining a corporation’s authority to condemn property already serving a public use. Both analyses require express statutory authorization and turn on the character of the property being condemned. The former, however, concerns the <em>power </em>to condemn and looks to whether the State has set aside state-owned property for public use so that the property is no longer held in its proprietary capacity. The inquiry does not depend on whether the property is actually being used for any present public use. <em>See Superior Court, </em><a href="/wash/91/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="91 Wash. 454" data-case-ids="631935" data-case-paths="/wash/91/0454-01">91 Wash. at 455-56</a>.

Br. of Resp’t PUD at 42-45. But this overstates the court’s holding and introduces the question posed by Justice González’s concurrence/dissent: whether DNR or CNW were denied an opportunity to make their case.

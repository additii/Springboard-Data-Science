    <p id="b1196-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1196.15",1196,[282,1440,1199,353]]]'>Appellant interposed the defense to the counterclaim that it had furnished a written warranty when the tires were shipped, which had not been complied with by appellees, and for that reason it was not liable on the written warranty; and that it was not liable on an implied warranty, because such warranty had been supplanted by the written warranty.</p>

    <p id="b1198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1198.5",1198,[305,833,1195,149]]]'>We think the last clause in. the written warranty restricts its application to the original users of the tires. The language is plain and unambiguous.</p>

The learned attorney for appellant frankly admits that the express warranty was to the original users, but claims that the express warranty to the users amounts to a written refusal to make any warranty, either express or implied, to the dealer. There is no express refusal in the written warranty to protect the dealer against unmerchantable and reasonably unfit tires for the purposes for which intended, and no language therein from which a refusal to extend such protection may be inferred. According to our construction of the contract, the cause was submitted to the .jury upon the correct theory.</p>
    <p id="b1198-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1198.7",1198,[296,1752,1206,300]]]'>• The '-undisputed testimony revealed that about 5 per cent, of the tires are worthless and unmerchantable. This is a sufficient proportion of the whole number to ■warrant the submission of the issue of unmerchantableness of the tires to the jury for determination, so that issue was properly submitted to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b1198-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1198.8",1198,[303,2058,1200,298]]]'>Another contention of appellant for a reversal of the judgment is that the verdict is excessive.

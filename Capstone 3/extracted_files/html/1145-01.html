    <blockquote id="b1165-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1165.18",1165,[168,1771,1203,588]]]'>“The court finds that H. H. Taylor is a resident of Texarkana, Texas, is a practicing attorney of that city, that he has an office in that city and has no office in Texarkana, Arkansas. He is here prosecuted for failing to pay an occupation tax to the city of Texarkana, Arkansas, for 1931. During that year he appeared in the municipal court of Texarkana, Arkansas, as attorney for various parties at least 25 times. He had one client whose office was in Texarkana, Arkansas, and he consulted with this client as its attorney in its office in Texarkana, Arkansas. He has been admitted to practice before the Supreme court and the other courts of the .State of Texas.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b1166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1166.3",1166,[281,371,1201,444]]]'>
      <a id="p1146" href="#p1146" data-label="1146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1146</a>“The court finds as a matter of law that the city of Texarkana does not have authority to impose an occupation tax on attorneys who appear in the courts in that city unless they reside in that city, or have an office or place of business there. Taylor does not have an office or place of business in Texarkana, Arkansas, nor does he reside in that city. He is not therefore liable for the occupation tax, and the court therefore finds him not guilty.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b1166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1166.4",1166,[280,822,1199,703]]]'>“It is the opinion of the court that the statutes of Arkansas grant to Taylor, as a Texas attorney, the right to appear in the courts of this State. See 60S to 606, inclusive, of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest. If the city has the power to tax the exercise of this right, it has the power to destroy it. The court does not think the Legislature meant to vest in the city the right to say who should appear as attorneys in the courts held in the city. The court therefore finds that the power to impose an occupation tax on attorneys which was vested in the city by § 7618 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest did not include the power to tax an attorney who neither resides in nor has an office or place of business in the city, and who only appears in court and/or advises his clients in said city.</blockquote>

    <p id="b1167-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1167.5",1167,[151,1045,1204,441]]]'>It is argued very earnestly and with much plausibility that the Texarkana ordinance, by its terms, applies only to residents of that city pursuing the named occupations, etc., within its limits. But whether this be true or not, we think the court below was correct in holding that § 605, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, applied to and governed in this case, and that appellee’s status was that of an enrolled nonresident attorney, within the meaning of that section.</p>
    <p id="b1167-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1167.6",1167,[151,1501,1202,388]]]'>Chapter 3 of Thornton on Attorneys-at-Law is devoted to the subject of taxation of attorneys. Yol. I, page 103. After citing cases from numerous courts to the effect that nonresident attorneys who pursue their profession in cities other than that of their residence may be taxed in such cities, the author says: “It is doubtful if mere incidental practice would subject a nonresident to taxation.”</p>
    <p id="b1167-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1167.7",1167,[151,1904,1201,238]]]'>The court below evidently regarded the practice of appellee in the courts of this State as merely incidental to the practice of his profession in the adjoining State, and that he was not therefore subject to the tax.

This section applies not only to cities of the first and second-class, but to the entire State, and, as there does not appear to be any authority for the exaction of any other fee from appellee, the judgment of the court below must be affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>

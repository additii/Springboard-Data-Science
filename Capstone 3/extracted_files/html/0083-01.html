Pursuant to a warrant, a blood sample was extracted from Martines after an officer suspected he was driving while under the influence (DUI). The blood tests revealed a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of about 0.061 and markers of two different central nervous system depressants. Martines was charged with felony DUI under RCW 46.61.502. He sought to suppress the blood test results showing the presence of drugs on the ground that there was no probable cause to show he was under the influence of drugs, as opposed to alcohol.

    <p id="b129-5" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[202,670,1246,689]]]'>¶4 The relevant facts are undisputed. On June 16, 2012, officers observed Martines driving his vehicle erratically on State Route 167. Martines’s car veered into another car, swerved into the median, and rolled over. An off-duty Tukwila detective saw the collision and drove to the accident site. The detective observed that Martines was stumbling, had slurred speech, and smelled like beer. The detective, along with other witnesses, observed Martines crawl back into his vehicle, retrieve a bag, and throw it into a ditch. Martines later engaged in an altercation with a passenger from the other car. A King County Sheriff’s deputy arrived, and the deputy and the detective placed Martines in handcuffs.</p>
    <p id="b129-6" data-blocks='[["BL_129.6",129,[202,1392,1252,583]]]'>¶5 A Washington State trooper arrived to the scene moments later, interviewed witnesses, and was debriefed by the detective. The trooper took custody of Martines and informed him he was under arrest for suspicion of DUI. The trooper observed Martines had red, bloodshot eyes and smelled of alcohol. Martines told the trooper he drank “‘[o]ne Blue Moon’” beer that night. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Nov. 5, 2012) at 20. The trooper located a bag in a nearby ditch containing a Blue Moon cardboard six-pack container with only one unopened beer bottle. VRP (Nov. 8, 2012) at 107-08.</p>

The warrant did not include any express reference to testing of the blood sample.</p>

The Washington State Toxicology Laboratory tested the sample for the presence of alcohol and drugs. The test results indicated Martines had a BAC of 0.061 and 0.062 at the time of the testing, which the toxicologist estimated would have been 0.121 two hours after the accident. Martines’s blood also contained 0.05 milligrams per liter of diazepam, a central nervous depressant and active ingredient in Valium, and 0.03 milligrams per liter of nordiazepam, also a nervous system depressant and metabolite of diazepam. Martines had been previously convicted of vehicular assault while driving under the influence of an intoxicant, a predicate offense for felony DUI under RCW 46.61.502(6)(b)(ii). The State charged Martines with felony DUI.</p>

He argued there was no probable cause to test his blood sample for drugs because witnesses observed only signs of alcohol intoxication. The State objected, arguing that in a DUI context, testing seeks to determine the <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>existence of an impairing substance, which may be alcohol, drugs, or a combination of both. Further, the State argued that once it obtains a blood sample through a lawful search, it may test the sample for anything it deems appropriate. The trial court denied Martines’s motion. The court held that if probable cause exists to test for either alcohol or drugs, then probable cause exists to test for both. The evidence of alcohol and drugs in Martines’s blood was admitted at trial, and the jury found Martines guilty of felony DUI.</p>

This requirement “eliminates the danger of unlimited discretion in the executing officer’s determination of what to seize.” <em>Perrone, </em>119 Wn.2d at 546. Courts examine the purpose of the “particular description” requirement to determine whether the description is valid. These purposes include (1) preventing exploratory searches, (2) protecting against “seizure of objects on the mistaken assumption that they fall within” the warrant, and (3) ensuring that probable cause is present. <em>Id. </em>at 545.</p>
    <p id="b135-4" data-blocks='[["BL_135.4",135,[201,1020,1248,913]]]'>¶21 The warrant in this case authorized the “extract [ion]” of a blood sample from Martines, indicating probable cause existed to believe his blood contained evidence of DUI. CP at 100-01. The purpose of the warrant was to draw a sample of blood from Martines to obtain evidence of DUI. It is not sensible to read the warrant in a way that stops short of obtaining that evidence. A warrant authorizing a blood draw necessarily authorizes blood testing, consistent with and confined to the finding of probable cause. The only way for the State to obtain evidence of DUI from a blood sample is to test the blood sample for intoxicants. <em>See State v. Grenning, </em><a href="/wash-app/142/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="142 Wash. App. 518" data-case-ids="3974124" data-case-paths="/wash-app/142/0518-01">142 Wn.

The warrant in this case was supported by probable cause to believe Martines’s blood contained evidence of DUI. We apply a commonsense reading to the warrant and conclude it authorized not merely the drawing and storing of a blood sample but also the toxicology tests performed to detect the presence of drugs or alcohol. <em>See Perrone, </em>119 Wn.2d at 549 (“Search warrants are to be <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>tested and interpreted in a commonsense, practical manner, rather than in a hypertechnical sense.”).</p>

Martines does not address the permissible scope of the search, resting his arguments on the warrant’s lack of probable cause and particularity. We emphasize that police “must execute a search warrant strictly within the bounds set by the warrant.” <em>State v.

We hold that a warrant authorizing the testing of a blood sample for intoxicants does not require separate findings of probable cause to suspect drug and alcohol use so long as there is probable cause to suspect intoxication that may be caused by alcohol, drugs, or a combination of both. We further hold that the search warrant authorized testing Martines’s blood sample for intoxicants because it authorized a blood draw to obtain evidence of DUI.</p>

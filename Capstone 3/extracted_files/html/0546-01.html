The Court of Appeals concluded that it is, and that Joseph Njonge’s public trial right was violated when the trial court purportedly excluded observers during hardship excusáis. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals remanded for a new trial without reaching Njonge’s other assignments of error, including claims that the trial court improperly excluded a family member of the victim (who was also a witness) and members of the press from portions of voir dire. Based on our review of the record, we conclude the trial court did not close proceedings in violation of Njonge’s public trial right. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals and remand to that court to address Njonge’s additional assignments of error on which we did not grant review.</p>

We decline to overrule well-settled precedent holding that a defendant may raise a public trial claim for the first time on appeal and therefore address the merits of Njonge’s claim. Njonge has failed to show, however, that the trial court completely closed the courtroom during any portion of voir dire. Further, the trial court acted well within its discretion by excluding a family member of the victim who would be testifying and by disallowing media to film voir dire. Finding no public trial violation, we reverse the Court of Appeals. We remand this case to that court to consider Njonge’s remaining claims of error on which we did not grant review.</p>

It is therefore clear that, under the statute, Watkins is. .exonerated from liability to the bank upon the note upon which this suit was brought; but whether the party can avail himself of this defence -in bar to a recovery at law, or must resort to a court of equity for relief, seems to be the main question presented by the record for the consideration of this court.</p>

    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[202,634,1247,854]]]'>¶24 We find the allegations in the State’s complaint sufficient to establish a prima facie case of purposeful minimum contacts. The State alleges that (1) the Companies together dominated the global market for CRTs, (2) the Companies sold CRTs into international streams of commerce with the intent that the CRTs would be incorporated into millions of CRT products sold across the United States and in large quantities in Washington, and (3) along with their coconspirators, the Companies intended for their price-fixing activities to elevate the price of CRT products purchased by consumers in Washington. CP at 15, 3. Taking these allegations as verities, as we must at this stage, we agree with the State that “[t]he presence of millions of CRTs in Washington was not the result of chance or the random acts of third parties, but a fundamental attribute of [the Companies’] businesses.” State of Wash.’s Suppl.

      <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a> ¶25 An exercise of jurisdiction based on the allegations in the State’s complaint is not foreclosed by <em>J. McIntyre, </em>and to dismiss at this stage before relevant jurisdictional discovery would be inconsistent with the legal standards we apply under CR 12(b). While we have few CR 12(b)(2) cases, we find our CR 12(b)(6) cases helpful by analogy. Our liberal notice pleading rules are intended “to facilitate the full airing of claims having a legal basis.” <em>Berge v. Gorton, </em><a href="/wash-2d/88/0756-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="88 Wash. 2d 756" data-case-ids="1111239" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/88/0756-01">88 Wn.2d 756</a>, 759, <a href="/citations/?q=567%20P.2d%20187" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="567 P.2d 187">567 P.2d 187</a> (1977). Consistent with this purpose, CR 8(a)(1) provides that a complaint need only set forth “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief” and we have repeatedly emphasized that we grant CR 12(b)(6) motions for failure to state a claim very “ ‘sparingly and with care.’ ” <em>Orwick v. City of Seattle, </em><a href="/wash-2d/103/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="103 Wash. 2d 249" data-case-ids="1134142" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/103/0249-01">103 Wn.2d 249</a>, 254-55, <a href="/citations/?q=692%20P.2d%20793" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="692 P.2d 793">692 P.2d 793</a> (1984) (quoting 27 Federal Procedure, Lawyers Edition § 62:465 (1984) and citing 5 Charles Allen Wright &amp; Arthur R.

We see no reason to apply a different approach to a CR 12(b)(2) motion, and in fact we previously took such an approach in <em>FutureSelect, </em>where we reversed a trial court’s decision to dismiss on the pleadings after considering numerous arguments for dismissal, including a CR 12(b)(2) argument. 180 Wn.2d at 959. There, we concluded that “[a]t this stage of litigation, the allegations of the complaint establish sufficient minimum contacts to survive a CR 12(b)(2) motion.” <em>Id. </em>at 963. We found that the trial court dismissed prematurely, some limited discovery was warranted, and defendant “may renew its jurisdictional challenge after appropriate discovery has been conducted.” <em>Id. </em>at 966, 963. Consistent with these standards, we find the <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>State’s complaint survives. Nothing in our opinion precludes the Companies from renewing their motions after further discovery bearing on relevant facts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Companies argue that since they submitted declarations the State cannot stand on the allegations in its complaint but must submit evidence to meet its burden, citing federal case law holding that courts are not permitted to “ ‘assume the truth of allegations in a pleading which are contradicted by affidavit.’ ” Suppl.

Prior to appropriate discovery, however, we decline to find that an allegation in the complaint is defeated by a contrary statement in a declaration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> With the State having sufficiently asserted purposeful minimum contacts at this stage, the burden shifts to the Companies to present a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction is unreasonable and inconsistent with notions of fair play and substantial justice, “ ‘consideration being <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>given to the quality, nature, and extent of the activity in the forum state, the relative convenience of the parties, the benefits and protection of the laws of the forum state afforded the respective parties, and the basic equities of the situation.’ ” <em>FutureSelect, </em>180 Wn.2d at 963-64 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Shute v. Carnival Cruise Lines, </em><a href="/wash-2d/113/0763-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="113 Wash. 2d 763" data-case-ids="1172056" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/113/0763-01">113 Wn.2d 763</a>, 767, <a href="/citations/?q=783%20P.2d%2078" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="783 P.2d 78">783 P.2d 78</a> (1989)). At this stage, all of these considerations weigh strongly in favor of finding that jurisdiction is reasonable. The inconvenience for the large, multinational Companies to defend themselves in the forum they intentionally targeted with price-fixed products does not outweigh the State’s strong interest in ensuring Washington citizens receive the protection of state antitrust laws, especially since Washington is the only forum in which indirect consumers of CRTs may be entitled to recovery.</p>

Specifically, the complaint alleged that Defendants sold these CRTs at inflated prices to out-of-state assemblers and that these assemblers then incorporated the CRTs into end products (CRT Products) and later sold these CRT Products to consumers in Washington. According to the State, the end purchasers of CRT Products suffered the ultimate harm from the passed-on overpricing. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 18, 20. In its complaint, the State does not estimate how many CRT Products—or even how many of Defendants’ CRTs—were purchased by Washington consumers during the 12-year conspiracy period, but notes that 28 million CRT monitors were purchased in North America in 1995 alone and that Defendants collectively held a 78 percent share of the global CRT market.

The State acknowledges that Defendants operated mainly outside of Washington, with their principal places of business in the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan, China, Malaysia, Brazil, Mexico, and California. CP at 4-12. The State did not contest Defendants’ declarations filed in support of their CR 12(b)(2) motions showing that they maintained no offices in Washington and employed no Washington employees. CP at 40-42, 56-64, 84-86, 104-06, 203-06. The State did not challenge Defendants’ showing that for many of them, their only connection with Washington was that the CRTs they manufactured were incorporated into CRT Products by immediate purchasers, and then the CRT Products were sold by those immediate purchasers to nonparticipants in that original purchase, i.e., to Washington consumers.</p>

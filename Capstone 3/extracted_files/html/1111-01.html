    <blockquote id="b1130-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1130.6",1130,[299,619,1203,406]]]'>“The policy in this case, by its plain language, provides that the proof of disability must be made before the plaintiff has reached the age of sixty years. There is no proof in this record that the plaintiff’s proof of disability was made prior to the reaching of sixty years, and, under the plaiin terms of the policy, the court is of the opinion that there is no liability in the case. For this reason, the motion for a new trial is granted.”</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b1130-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1130.8",1130,[293,1864,1202,401]]]'>“The company will, during the continuance of such disability, waive payment of each premium as it becomes due, commencing with the first premium due after approval of said due proof.

    <p id="b1131-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1131.5",1131,[161,1129,1203,304]]]'>It would be a strained construction to construe the language thus quoted to mean that proof of loss must be filed with the insurance company before the insured attains the age of 60 years.

Co. </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em><a href="/ark/187/0984-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="187 Ark. 984" data-case-ids="1432000" data-case-paths="/ark/187/0984-01">187 Ark. 984</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20S.W.2d%20520" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="63 S.W.2d 520">63 S. W. (2d) 520</a>, the trial court was justified in the conclusion reached. This is not the effect of the Farrell case. We held in the Farrell case, as we have in all other cases decided, that liability attached upon causation of the injury suffered, but that the cause of action on such liability accures only after the filing of the proof of disability. The mailing of the proof of loss was not treated or considered as a condition precedent to liability in the Farrell case, but it was treated as a condition precedent to the right of recovery. The rule is, as announced in the Farrell case, and in all others on the subject announced by this court, that liability attaches upon causation of total and permanent disability of the insured, but that the right of recovery is postponed until notice to the insurer of the disability or the filing of the proof of disability or the lapse of time provided for in the policy in reference to the accrual of the right of recovery. <em>Ætna Life Ins.

    <p id="b1132-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1132.4",1132,[311,455,1204,655]]]'>Appellant insists also that <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Jackson, ante </em>p. 292, is authority for the trial court’s holding. Neither can we agree to this contention. In the Jackson case, no proof of loss was ever submitted to the insurance company. No notice was given to the insurer or to any agent with authority of the asserted right of liability. The first information brought to the knowledge of the insurance company was a letter of date January 16, 1932, addressed to the general agent at Little Rock. In the Jackson case, as heretofore stated, no effort had been made to effect proof of loss prior to the filing of the suit, and the suit was filed more than five years after the receipt of the alleged injury.</p>
    <p id="b1132-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1132.5",1132,[309,1118,1203,450]]]'>Neither can we agree that <em>Ætna Life Ins.

The Person case was disposed of on the theory that there was no substantial evidence that plaintiff’s physical condition had prevented him from doing all the substantial acts of his vocation in the usual and customary manner. We therefore held that the trial court erred in not directing a verdict in favor of appellant insurance company.</p>

The policy construed in the Bergholm case contains the following language:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1132-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1132.7",1132,[310,1779,1198,245]]]'>“To entitle the insured to the above total and permanent disability benefits, this policy at the time of making claim for such benefits must be in full force, and all premiums becoming due prior to the time of making claim must have been duly paid. ’ ’</blockquote>

This is the plain and unmistakable meaning of the language employed. However, we have no such language in the policy of insurance here under consideration. We think the language here employed is plain and definite to the effect that, if the <a id="p1115" href="#p1115" data-label="1115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1115</a>insured suffers total and permanent disability prior to his sixtieth birthday, and at the time has paid all premiums due, liability then and there attaches, and recovery is postponed until notice or proof of loss is submitted. For instance, suppose the insured, on the day prior to his sixtieth birthday, suffers an injury which results in the loss of both legs and both arms. In the natural course of events it would be impossible to make proof of loss prior to the insured’s sixtieth birthday. Such construction would nullify the plain intentions of the parties. True, this is an extreme imaginary case, but it is not beyond the limits which the parties had in mind at the time the contract was effected.</p>
    <p id="b1133-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1133.4",1133,[161,1013,1203,505]]]'>It is self-evident that the paramount consideration the parties had in mind at the execution of this contract was insurance against total and permanent disability. Any construction which nullifies this paramount consideration should be avoided, if possible. All courts agree that it is a fundamental rule of construction that insurance contracts, when ambiguous, should be construed most strongly against the insurer. <em>Mutual Life Ins.

That bill in equity is set out <em>in hcac verba </em>in this petition, and forms its <em>gravamen. </em>The injunction was granted according to the prayer of the petition. To the petition, Blakeney demurred; the demurrer being overruled by the court below, and he declining to plead or answer, but electing to stand on his demurrer, the court perpetuated the injunction with costs: from which action of the court below Blakeney appealed to this court.</p>
    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[140,1087,1208,422]]]'>That the circuit court erred in overruling the demurrer, we have no doubt. The bill in equity, set out <em>in hcec verba </em>in this proceeding, and which forms its gravamen, was before this court in the case of <em>Blakeney vs. Ferguson et al., </em>3 <em>Eng. </em>273, and was adjudged insufficient to resist a demurrer that was interposed to its action. With that decision we are not dissatisfied, and, as a necessary result, the doings of the court below in this case must be overturned. Decree reversed.</p>

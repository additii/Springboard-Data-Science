Appellants answered, and filed a cross-complaint setting forth claim for damages in an amount sufficient to extinguish appellee’s debt if the counter-claim be sustained. Final decree was rendered by the court on September 22, 1922, in favor of appellee against appellants for the recovery of said debt, and for the foreclosure of the mortgage, and dismissing the cross-complaint of appellants for want of equity. There was a sale of the land by the court’s commissioner, and on December 21, 1922, the sale came on for confirmation, and the court overruled the exceptions of appellants and confirmed the sale.</p>

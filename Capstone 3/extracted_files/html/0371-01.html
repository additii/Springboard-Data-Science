Specifically, it excluded evidence that Franklin’s live-in girlfriend Rasheena Hibbler had sent threatening e-mails to his other girlfriend Nanette Fuerte despite the fact that Hibbler had the motive (jealousy), the means (access to the computer and e-mail accounts at issue), and the prior history (of sending earlier threatening e-mails to Fuerte regarding her relationship with Franklin) to support Franklin’s theory of the case.</p>

Partial Report of Proceedings (RP) (June 22, 2009) at 10. The trial court clearly meant a bar higher than the relevance, foundation, and similar prerequisites to admissibility established by Washington’s Rules of Evidence (ER); the trial court meant that it could consider all the other evidence of Franklin’s guilt and exclude the “other suspect” evidence because the other proof of the defendant’s guilt was great.</p>
    <p id="b437-4" data-blocks='[["BL_437.5",437,[168,818,1258,967]]]'>¶3 We reverse. First, the United States Constitution bars the trial court from considering the strength or weakness of the State’s case in deciding whether to exclude defense-proffered other suspect evidence. The United States Supreme Court expressly reiterated this rule not long ago in <em>Holmes v. South Carolina, </em><a href="/us/547/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="547 U.S. 319" data-case-ids="3275811" data-case-paths="/us/547/0319-01">547 U.S. 319</a>, <a href="/us/547/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="547 U.S. 319" data-case-ids="3275811" data-case-paths="/us/547/0319-01">126 S. Ct. 1727</a>, <a href="/us/547/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="547 U.S. 319" data-case-ids="3275811" data-case-paths="/us/547/0319-01">164 L. Ed. 2d 503</a> (2006). Second, Washington law reinforces this constitutional mandate. We have never adopted a per se rule against admitting circumstantial evidence of another person’s motive, ability, or opportunity. Instead, our cases hold that if there is an adequate nexus between the alleged other suspect and the crime, such evidence should be admitted. The trial court violated both of these rules: it considered the strength of the State’s case against the defendant and it applied a per se standard to exclude the other suspect evidence. Thus, its exclusion of the proffered other suspect evidence was error under both our case law and our constitution.</p>

The two agreed in writing that she would pay him back on November 26, 2008. On November 6, 2008, Franklin showed up at Fuerte’s home uninvited. Fuerte and a male friend were watching a movie. Fuerte did not invite Franklin in but did talk with him outside for a few hours. At trial, she testified that Franklin seemed upset that she had another man at her house.</p>

Fuerte eventually contacted Human Resources, because the e-mails were directed to her work e-mail address, and contacted the police.

The perjury charge was based on Franklin’s testimony at a hearing for a permanent restraining order where he testified under oath that he did not post any ads or possess any explicit pictures of the victim. The stalking charge alleged that Franklin “repeatedly harass[ed]” Fuerte, Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 2, and the jury instructions defined “to harass” as “to carry out a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person which seriously alarms, annoys, or harasses or is detrimental to such person,” CP at 46.

Fuerte, . . . ma[de] an electronic communication to her . . . using . . . lewd, lascivious, indecent, or obscene words [or] images ...” CP at 2.</p>

That has not been the law in Washington, and it opens the door to irrelevant, speculative evidence in future cases.

Second, Franklin in no way connected Hibbler to the time4gamez@yahoo.com account — the account actually used to perpetrate the crime. Franklin did not show that Hibbler even knew of the account, let alone that she created or accessed it. Third, as for prior threats, the evidence shows only that Hibbler had sent threatening e-mails two to three years before the cyberstalking occurred. Though Hibbler contacted the victim five months before the cyberstalking began, she made no specific threats, and none of her e-mails suggest an intent to post salacious Craigslist ads or to send the harassing e-mails that supported the charges. These “ ‘[r] emote acts, disconnected and outside of the crime itself, cannot be separately proved’ ” to show that Hibbler intended to cyberstalk the victim or took an actual step to do so. <em>Downs, </em><a href="/wash/168/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="168 Wash. 664" data-case-ids="852094" data-case-paths="/wash/168/0664-01">168 Wash. at 667</a> (quoting <em>Greenfield, </em><a href="/ny/85/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="85 N.Y. 75" data-case-ids="2182427" data-case-paths="/ny/85/0075-01">85 N.Y. at 89</a>).</p>

I find no abuse of discretion in that determination. Hibbler sent threatening e-mails years before the cyberstalking began. Those actions were too remote in time to connect to Franklin’s crimes. Beyond that remote evidence, Franklin speculated only that Hibbler committed the crime because she had access to his computer, and he offered no other evidence or witness to corroborate her involvement in the crime. Here, the other-suspect evidence is far less than the evidence in <em>Holmes, </em>for example, where the defendant offered eight witnesses con<a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>necting the other suspect to the crime. <em>See State v.

In fact, Franklin presented evidence to the jury that Hibbler had accessed his personal e-mail account and sent an e-mail to the victim from that account. Thus, Franklin cannot say that the trial court completely restrained his right to defend himself on this point. The majority admits that some of this evidence made it to the jury, yet — with little explanation — finds reversible error because “some of it did not.” Majority at 383. At the very least, the fact that the jury heard this evidence weighs on the side of finding harmless error, to the extent one finds that any error occurred. But I do not find any reversible error in the trial court’s decision to exclude the other-suspect evidence. I respectfully dissent.</p>

Since Maziar was injured at sea, he brought a general maritime negligence claim against the DOC. He initially requested a jury trial, but he moved to strike his demand because he thought that no jury trial right existed for general maritime negligence cases. The DOC objected, but the trial court agreed with Maziar, struck his jury request, and awarded him damages after a bench trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court on the jury trial issue but on different grounds. It held that although a jury trial right generally applies to general maritime negligence actions in state court, the State does not have a constitutional or statutory jury trial right in tort actions.</p>

The first set deals with the situations in which a jury trial right attaches in general, and the second set deals with civil procedure in actions involving the State.</p>
    <p id="b142-5" data-blocks='[["BL_142.5",142,[212,875,1248,593]]]'>¶11 The first set consists of three provisions, originally enacted before 1889, that generally state that the jury trial right attaches to issues of fact. The first provision states, “An issue of fact, in an action for the recovery of money only, . . . shall be tried by a jury.” RCW 4.40.060. Second, “[a] 11 questions of fact other than those mentioned in RCW 4.44.080, shall be decided by the jury.” RCW 4.44.090.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Finally, “[a]ny party shall have the right in an action at law, upon an issue of fact, to demand a trial by jury.” RCW 4.48.010.

    <p id="b142-6" data-blocks='[["BL_142.6",142,[211,1493,1252,745]]]'>¶12 The second set consists of two provisions that appear in the RCW chapter titled “Actions and Claims Against State,” ch. 4.92 RCW. The first provision states that the attorney general shall act as counsel for the State and that “[t]he action shall proceed in all respects as other actions.” RCW 4.92.030. The second provision is the one in which the State waived sovereign immunity. It provides, “The state of Washington, whether acting in its governmental or proprietary capacity, shall be liable for damages arising out of its tortious conduct to the same extent as if it were a private person or corporation.” RCW 4.92.090. That statute was originally enacted in 1961 and was reenacted in its current form in 1963. <em>See </em>Laws of 1961, ch. 136, § 1; Laws of 1963, ch. 159, § 2.</p>

      <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>¶13 Read together, those sets of statutory provisions grant the State a jury trial right in tort actions. When the legislature waived sovereign immunity in 1961 and said the State was liable <em>“to the same extent as if it were a private person or </em>corporation,” the laws in effect at that time already provided that all issues of fact would be tried by a jury and that actions involving the State would <em>“proceed in all respects as other actions” </em>Laws of 1961, ch. 136, § 1 (emphasis added) (currently codified as RCW 4.92.090); Laws of 1895, ch. 95, § 3 (emphasis added) (currently codified as RCW 4.92.030); Laws of 1869, ch. 15, § 228 (currently codified as RCW 4.44.090). Since we presume the legislature knows the existing legal framework when it enacts a new law and derive the plain meaning of a provision from related statutes that disclose legislative intent, we conclude that the legislature meant to grant the State a jury trial right for the same actions in which private parties have that right through its language waiving sovereign immunity. The language of the provisions indicates that the legislature intended to treat the State as any other private person or corporation in a tort action. That conclusion is further supported by the fact that the legislature reenacted RCW 4.48.010 in 1984 to say, <em>“Any party </em>shall have the right in an action at law, upon an issue of fact, to demand a trial by jury.” Laws of 1984, ch. 258, § 512 (emphasis added). The legislature used the phrase “any party” knowing that the State was a potential party in a tort action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Thus, we hold that the legislature intended to grant the State a jury trial right in tort actions.</p>

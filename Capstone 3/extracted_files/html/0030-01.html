The jury acquitted Fuller of one count and deadlocked on the other. The trial court declared a mistrial on that count, and the State sought to retry Fuller. Fuller moved to dismiss, arguing that retrial would subject him to reprosecution for the same offense after an acquittal, in violation of double jeopardy. The superior court denied Fuller’s motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We hold that jeopardy never terminated as to the count the State seeks to retry, and that the jury’s acquittal on the other count is of no consequence. Because retrial does not implicate double jeopardy, we affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>

Although Fuller is correct that the State may not reprosecute count II—the count on which he was acquitted—he is incorrect regarding reprosecution of the other charged means.

    <p id="b94-4" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[197,634,1251,1083]]]'>¶18 Fuller’s case is distinguishable from <em>Sanabria </em>in two key ways. First, in <em>Sanabria, </em>the Court was contemplating a new prosecution after a full acquittal. It prohibited <em>“further </em>prosecution for participation in that [gambling] business” because there was an acquittal on an <em>element </em>of the crime which the current and future crimes would share. <a href="/us/437/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="437 U.S. 54" data-case-ids="6177463" data-case-paths="/us/437/0054-01">437 U.S. at 73</a> (emphasis added). <em>Sanabria </em>thus concerned the collateral estoppel element of double jeopardy preventing future prosecution of new charges. However, in Fuller’s case there is no new prosecution. The State brought its charges in one prosecution, for which there was a simultaneous acquittal and mistrial. The retrial the State seeks is not “further” prosecution; it is continued prosecution of the same charge on which the jury was declared hung. <em>Cf. Williams, </em><a href="/f3d/422/1006-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="422 F.3d 1006" data-case-ids="8936398" data-case-paths="/f3d/422/1006-01">422 F.3d at 1011</a> (noting, <em>“Sanabria </em>... protects Williams from further prosecution on the same offense under a different theory, but it does not apply in this case, where the two theories of culpability were presented to the same jury simultaneously” and the jury convicted on one theory and acquitted on the other).</p>

The judgment of acquittal was for the crime as a whole. In contrast, the jury acquitted Fuller of only one means of committing assault in the second degree. Two means of committing the same offense were presented to the jury: assault causing substantial bodily harm and assault with a deadly weapon. Although it is clear that the jury acquitted Fuller of committing assault by substantial bodily harm, it is equally clear the jury did not acquit him <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>of assault with a deadly weapon.

    <p id="b95-4" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[200,463,1254,520]]]'>¶20 Fuller’s reliance on <em>Wright </em>is likewise ineffectual. Fuller depends specifically on this statement in <em>Wright: </em>“When a proceeding ends in an undisturbed verdict or verdict equivalent on any alternative, the State may not prosecute the defendant on any other means of committing the same offense.” 165 Wn.2d at 802. <em>Wright </em>cites <em>Sanabria </em>for this proposition, <em>id,., </em>but it is clearly an overstatement of <em>Sanabria’s </em>holding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> As explained, <em>Sanabria </em>is distinguishable because it contemplated further prosecution after a full acquittal on the offense as a whole.</p>

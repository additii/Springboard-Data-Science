The jury asked the court whether it may consider “observations of the defendant’s actions-demeanor during the court case” as “evidence.” In response, the trial court instructed the jury that “[e]vidence includes what you witness in the courtroom.” All parties <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>agree that the record contains no references whatsoever to Barry’s in-court demeanor, so we have no way of determining what aspects of Barry’s “demeanor” drew the jury’s attention and whether the jury’s observations were favorable or unfavorable to Barry.

During its deliberations, the jury sent a written question to the court: “Can we use as ‘evidence’ for deliberations our observations of the defendant’s actions-demeanor during the court case?” The trial judge summoned counsel for both parties and informed them of the question.

But after the defense has rested its case, and after closing arguments, the trial court cannot instruct that those observations may be treated as “evidence” bearing on the determination of guilt or innocence when the defendant has had no opportunity to challenge or explain that “evidence.” Such an instruction is akin to allowing a prosecutor to argue evidence not presented at trial or to allowing a new witness to testify privately, without cross-examination, to the jury during its deliberations.

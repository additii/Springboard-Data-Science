As a general rule, “ [t] he time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall be computed by excluding the first day, and including the last, unless the last day is a holiday, Saturday, or Sunday, and then it is also excluded.” RCW 1.12.040. Kovacs contends that the general rule applies. The department contends that there is a different rule for workers’ compensation claims and that the one-year time limit on workers’ compensation claims includes the date of the injury.

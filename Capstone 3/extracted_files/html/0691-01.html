In 1989, the Washington Legislature mandated coverage for neurodevelopmental therapies (neurodevelopmental therapies or NDT) (speech, occupational, and physical therapy) in employer-sponsored group plans for children under age seven (the neurodevelopmental therapies mandate or NDT mandate). RCW 48.44.450. In 2005, the legislature enacted the mental health parity act, which mandates coverage for “mental health services.” RCW 48.44.341. We hold that the statutes do not conflict — neurodevelopmental therapies may constitute “mental health services” if the therapies are medically necessary to treat a mental disorder identified in the American Psychiatric Association’s <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>(4th rev. ed. 2000) <em>(DSM-IV-TR). </em>Therefore, the blanket exclusions of neurodevelopmental therapies in the plaintiffs’ health contracts are void and unenforceable.</p>

    <p id="b742-5" data-blocks='[["BL_742.5",742,[191,802,1247,958]]]'>¶16 Regence BlueShield makes several failing arguments. It first argues that neurodevelopmental therapies are an exception to the mental health parity act. It arrives at this conclusion using the statutory maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius. Applying this maxim, Regence BlueShield argues that the NDT mandate has both positive and negative requirements. The positive is that employer-sponsored plans must provide NDT coverage to children through age six. <em>See </em>RCW 48.44.450(1). The negative is that no employer-sponsored plan is required to cover NDT to children over age six and that no other health plan is required to provide NDT benefits. <em>See </em>RCW 48.44.450(1). Under this interpretation, Regence BlueShield argues that the two statutes conflict — the mental health parity act requires coverage not required by the NDT mandate. Regence BlueShield concludes that the NDT mandate is the more specific statute and, therefore, controls. Consequently, O.S.T. and L.H. are not entitled to coverage.</p>

However, once the legislature passed the mental health parity act, the statute requires coverage regardless of the NDT mandate. The statutory maxim is subordinate to the primary rule of statutory interpretation, which is to follow legislative intent. <em>See DeGrief v.

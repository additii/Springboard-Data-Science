This appears from the reading of the paragraph itself, wherein it is expressly stated that he does not owe this amount. And, so far as the record shows, this was merely an effort to buy peace, to settle the lawsuit, and it had no effect, and was incompetent, and was just as damaging when got 'before the jury by reading and commenting 'on by the attorney as if it had been introduced in evidence.</p>

For a full statement of the facts under which said judgment was based and the judgment itself, reference is made to the case of <em>Keith </em>v. <em>Drainage District No. 7 of Poinsett County, </em>reported in <a href="/ark/183/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="183 Ark. 384" data-case-ids="1441831" data-case-paths="/ark/183/0384-01">183 Ark. 384</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20S.W.2d%2059" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="36 S.W.2d 59">36 S.

    <p id="b575-4" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[161,709,1206,1063]]]'>The trial court found in the instant case that the commissioners had revenues sufficient to pay the judgment of appellants, but that they had been pledged to the payment of bonds issued and sold to procure money with which to build levies and make other necessary improvements, and declared as a matter of law that the bondholders were preferred on account of such pledge over the judgment obtained by appellants. The finding of fact that there are sufficient revenues to pay the judgment of appellants is supported by the weight of the testimony. The finding of fact that the commissioners of the district pledged the revenues to the payment of the bonded indebtedness is also supported by the weight of the evidence. The declaration of law by the court to the effect that the bondholders’ lien on the revenues of the district were superior to appellants’ judgment claim was erroneous. In so declaring, the court disregarded the constitutional guaranty, as well as the rule announced in the Organ case, <em>supra. </em>Appellants ’ judgment was a lien on the revenues of the district paramount to the lien of the bondholders,</p>

According to the record before us, the remedy by execution proved fruitless and will continue to do so. The only lands owned by the district are tax title lands that no one seems willing to buy. It is argued, however, that mandamus will not lie against the commissioners because it is discretionary with them as to which claimants they will prefer and pay out of the revenues. They have no such discretion. It was their duty to pay for lands taken for the purposes of the dis<a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>trict out of the revenues derived by taxation in the district, under the constitutional provision quoted above, to the exclusion of all claimants thereto not in their class.</p>

Today we decide if a particular method of challenging jurors after voir dire — a method commonly employed in trial courts around the state — violates the constitutional right to a public trial. At the conclusion of voir dire questioning, counsel exercised for cause challenges orally at the bench and subsequently exercised peremptory challenges silently by exchanging a list of jurors and alternatively striking names from it. All of voir dire, including the juror challenges, occurred in open court, on the record, and in full view of any observer in the courtroom. We hold the juror challenges in this case were exercised in a manner consistent with the minimum safeguards of the public trial right and affirm.</p>

The first day of trial was unremarkable from an open court perspective. Several preliminary matters consumed the morning, and the trial judge heard argument and ruled on these motions in open court and on the record. The jury pool was brought into the courtroom after lunch for jury selection. The trial judge placed the jury pool under oath and briefly explained the mechanics of jury selection, including the parties’ right to challenge jurors.</p>

Jurors 15 and 30 had strongly indicated they could not be impartial jurors in response to questions during voir dire, which occurred in the presence of Love, other potential jurors, and the public. The trial judge granted both of Love’s for cause challenges.

There is no indication that spectators (prospective jurors included) were forced to leave the courtroom, that the courtroom was locked, or that anyone was prohibited from entering. Instead, the courtroom remained open while counsel exercised their peremptory challenges, in the same manner as it was during the discussion of the for cause challenges.

In open court and on the record, the judge read the names of the first 14 jurors left on the struck juror sheet (excluding jurors 4 and 15) and empaneled 12 jurors and two alternates. The judge thanked and dismissed the <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>remaining potential jurors — including jurors 4, 15, and 30 — without further explanation.

He maintains that exercising for cause challenges at the bench and peremptory challenges on the struck juror sheet effectively “closed” the courtroom, though it was unlocked and open, because the public was not privy to the challenges in real time. He also argues his right to be present at all critical stages of the trial was violated because he could not approach the bench with counsel to discuss the for cause challenges.</p>

Typically, experience and logic determine if the public trial right attaches to a particular court proceeding, though we can also rely on prior cases that have applied right to the proceeding at issue. <em>Sublett, </em>176 Wn.2d at 73; <em>State v.

Our prior cases hold it “well settled that the right to a public trial . . . extends to jury selection,” <em>State v. Brightman, </em><a href="/wash-2d/155/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="155 Wash. 2d 506" data-case-ids="3766216" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/155/0506-01">155 Wn.2d 506</a>, 515, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20P.3d%20150" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="122 P.3d 150">122 P.3d 150</a> (2005), and we reaffirm that the right attaches to jury selection, including for cause and peremptory chal<a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>lenges. Unlike administrative or hardship excusáis, for cause and peremptory challenges can raise questions about a juror’s neutrality and a party’s motivation for excusing the juror that implicate the core purpose of the right, and questioning jurors in open court is critical to protect that right. Open and transparent questioning fosters public confidence in subsequent challenges to jurors and, ultimately, the composition of juries in criminal trials.</p>

The transcript of the discussion about for cause challenges and the struck juror sheet showing the peremptory challenges are both publicly available. The public was present for and could scrutinize the selection of Love’s jury from start to finish, affording him the safeguards of the public trial right missing in cases where we found closures of jury selection. <em>See Wise, </em>176 Wn.2d at 7-8; <em>Paumier, </em>176 Wn.2d at 33-34.

But the record before us does not demonstrate a violation of Love’s right to be present. Love was present in the courtroom during all of voir dire, including potential jurors’ answers to questions that form the basis for challenges. Nothing suggests that Love could not consult with his attorney about which jurors to challenge or meaningfully participate in the process. <em>Cf. <a href="/citations/?q=868%20P.2d%20835" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="868 P.2d 835">id.</a> </em>(right to be present violated where portion of jury selection occurred between the court and counsel over e-mail, without consultation of jailed defendant).

We hold on these facts that exercising for cause challenges at a bench conference and peremptory challenges on a written list do not constitute a closure. Love’s convictions are affirmed.</p>

R. 47(e)(9) (“The clerk shall keep a list of jurors passed for cause and when it is complete will provide the list to the attorneys for the parties who will, in turn, exercise challenges by striking the name of each challenged juror without oral comment.”); Ferry/Pend Oreille/Stevens County Super.

Ct. Local Civ.

Ct. Local Crim. R. 6.3; Kittitas County Super. Ct. Local Civ. R. 47 (“Unless good cause is shown, all peremptory challenges shall be exercised in open Court at the side bar by marking the challenged juror’s name on a form to be provided by the Court.”); Klickitat/Skamania Super. Ct. Local Civ.

The purpose of this rule is to preserve the secrecy of the peremptory challenge process and all parties and their counsel shall conduct themselves to that end”).

During the operation and completion of the first two kilns, complaint was made by appellee that the burners were working- unsatisfactorily, and they were removed and plain open end pipes were installed in their places under a written supplemental agreement of date May 26, 1930, in which it was recited that the equipment was installed as per agreement, but the burners, proving unsatisfactory, were removed and plain open end pipes installed in their places, for which a deduction of $700 less actual cost of open end pipes should be deducted from the original price of $1,200 for-the equipment. After the kilns had been furnished and the brick removed, appellee notified appellant to remove the equipment on .account of its failure to perform the work intended. The notice was given in June, 1930, and, after appellant removed same, this suit for damages was instituted.</p>
    <p id="b509-10" data-blocks='[["BL_509.12",509,[151,1980,1206,463]]]'>Appellant filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. The cause proceeded to a hearing upon the pleadings, and at the conclusion of the testimony appellant moved for an instructed verdict, which was refused by the court over its objection and exception. The cause was then submitted to the jury upon the issues joined and the testimony adduced, which resulted in a verdict and consequent judgment against .appellant in tlie sum of $3,000, from which is this appeal.</p>

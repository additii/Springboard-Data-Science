The random drawing in this case was done by the trial court’s judicial assistant at a brief recess during closing arguments. Defendant Martin Arthur Jones contends that this violated his constitutional rights to a public trial and to be present at all critical stages of trial proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b469-7" data-blocks='[["BL_469.10",469,[201,1156,1247,367]]]'>¶2 Based on the specific facts presented by the record before us, we hold that the random drawing by the judicial assistant did not implicate Jones’ public trial right. We also hold that Jones waived his right-to-presence claim by failing to raise an objection until after the jury reached its verdict. We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the Court of Appeals, and reinstate Jones’ conviction.</p>

Briefly, Jones’ wife was pulled over for speeding and, based on her performance in field sobriety tests, she was arrested for driving under the influence. While one state trooper took Jones’ wife into custody, another stayed at the scene to process the vehicle for towing. A white male approached the trooper at the scene and shot him in the back of the head. Remarkably, the trooper survived and identified Jones as the shooter. Based on the trooper’s identification and other evidence, Jones was charged in Pacific County with attempted first degree murder. The trial was ultimately held in Pierce County. <em>State v. Jones, </em><a href="/wash-app/175/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="175 Wash. App. 87" data-case-ids="4192026" data-case-paths="/wash-app/175/0087-01">175 Wn.

      <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>¶4 The question of how the alternate jurors would be designated came up early and often in the Pierce County proceedings. The question was first raised by the court during pretrial motions. The court offered Jones a choice for how to designate the alternates: “If we are not going to tell [the jurors which of them are alternates], then it’s random and we pull it out of the rotating cylinder, and it’s whoever is left is who is eligible to be selected out. Otherwise, it’s your last four.” 1 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) at 35 (Oct. 15,2010). The court invited the attorneys to discuss it among themselves and specifically to “[c]hat with Mr. Jones, see what he prefers.” <em>Id. </em>at 36. The court made it clear that “defense really controls on that. It’s either random, or it’s the last four.” <em>Id.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[202,1097,1247,414]]]'>¶5 The court later revisited the issue of designating alternates, reiterating that the “defense drives the bus on this.” <em>Id. </em>at 126 (Jan. 3, 2011). In response to questions raised by Jones’ attorney, the court noted that “[t]he box is back there in the corner. It’s really not - it’s . . . spinning and the numbers are all in there if we still have 16.” <em>Id. </em>at 127. Ultimately, Jones chose the random drawing as his preferred method for designating alternates.</p>
    <p id="b470-5" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[202,1530,1251,414]]]'>¶6 A panel of 100 jurors was summoned to appear. Voir dire occurred on the record in open court over the course of two days. The jurors were informed during voir dire that 4 of the seated jurors would be alternates. At the end of voir dire, the attorneys conducted their peremptory challenges on paper at counsel table in open court. Jones does not contend that any part of the pretrial jury selection proceedings violated his public trial right or right to presence.</p>

When the court asked if the jurors had any questions, one asked about the designation of alternates: “Just out of curiosity, you said there would be the 12 jurors. Do we know or are we supposed to know how that will happen?” 23 VRP at 3807-08 (Feb. 15,2011). The court reviewed the process that it would use to designate alternates:</p>

Both sides anticipated making lengthy closing arguments, so the court was careful to figure out a schedule that would include sufficient breaks for the jurors without disrupting the flow of each side’s closing arguments. The court planned to give the jurors a 15-minute break in the middle of the morning, a 90-minute lunch break, and another short break in the middle of the afternoon. 24 VRP at 3854-55 (Feb. 16, 2011). Neither party expressed any concerns about the court’s proposed schedule. The next day, the court reviewed the schedule again with all of the attorneys and Jones, again without anyone expressing any confusion, surprise, or objections.</p>

The deliberating and alternate jurors were all chosen by the same voir dire process in open court. The method for drawing the alternates, the box from which the alternates would be drawn, and the judicial assistant who would be doing the drawing were all identified on the record in open court. Jones himself chose the random drawing method for designating alternates, and (as discussed further below) Jones had the opportunity to object to the drawing if he was concerned about how it was conducted. In light of all these proceedings on the record in open court, public oversight at the moment the judicial assistant actually drew the pieces of paper designating the <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>alternate jurors would not play a significant positive role in the functioning of the drawing itself, and it would not advance the purposes underlying the public trial right.</p>

For instance, if Jones had chosen to designate the alternate jurors based on their juror numbers, would he now be arguing that a public trial violation occurred because the initial assignment of juror numbers was not done in open court? And what if the court were to use a computer program to randomly designate alternates? Jones indicated at oral argument that courts should simply avoid using such technology. Wash.

We have acknowledged that a knowing and voluntary waiver of this constitutional right to presence can be “express or implied,” and that it can be “implied” when a defendant “voluntarily absent [s] himself from the proceedings.” <em><a href="/f2d/464/1202-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="464 F.2d 1202" data-case-ids="709203" data-case-paths="/f2d/464/1202-01">Id.</a> </em>(citing <em>Taylor v.

We have even developed a framework for determining, under a totality of circumstances, whether a defendant’s absence from a proceeding is voluntary or not. <em>See State v. Thomson, </em><a href="/wash-2d/123/0877-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="123 Wash. 2d 877" data-case-ids="812769" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/123/0877-01">123 Wn.2d 877</a>, 881, <a href="/citations/?q=872%20P.2d%201097" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="872 P.2d 1097">872 P.2d 1097</a> (1994). But I can’t find any prior case from this court holding that a defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his or her right to presence when he or she didn’t <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>even know a proceeding was occurring because it happened during a recess, meaning during a time when court is not in session.</p>
    <p id="b483-5" data-blocks='[["BL_483.4",483,[202,520,1247,421]]]'>¶37 Instead, I would hold only that the random drawing of alternates by a previously approved process was not an event to which the right to presence attached. Just as there is no constitutional right to an open courtroom or presence for a bailiff’s or judicial assistant’s computer work, there is no constitutional right to an open courtroom or presence during this preapproved, random drawing, work, either. I therefore respectfully concur.</p>

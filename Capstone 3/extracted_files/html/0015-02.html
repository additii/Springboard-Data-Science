    <p id="b31-14" data-blocks='[["BL_31.16",31,[102,2117,1207,324]]]'>The record in this case shows that Green &amp; Wilson obtained a judgment against Julia Roane, in the Jefferson county circuit court, for nine hundred dollars debt, and three hundred and seven dollars and fifty-one cents damages, and that said judgment was affirmed by this court at the December term, 1866, <em>(<a href="/ark/24/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="24 Ark. 210" data-case-ids="8726697" data-case-paths="/ark/24/0210-01">24 Ark. 210</a>.)</em>

    <p id="b32-5" data-blocks='[["BL_32.4",32,[251,1095,1205,323]]]'>Under the provisions of said act, Roane and Bell filed their bill and made the necessary tender. At the hearing the Jefferson county circuit court decreed a perpetual injunction as to the judgment at law, save as to the sum of $251 <em>16, </em>and decreed costs against Green &amp; Wilson. Erom this judgment the defendants appealed to this court.</p>
    <p id="b32-6" data-blocks='[["BL_32.5",32,[246,1430,1204,430]]]'>The sole ground for entering a court of equity was to receive the benefit of the act of March 5, 1867.

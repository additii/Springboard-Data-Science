    <p id="b154-6" data-blocks='[["BL_154.6",154,[195,542,1250,945]]]'>¶5 We must first decide whether the trial court’s private questioning of jurors constituted a closure, thereby violating Coggin’s public trial rights. A criminal defendant has a right to a public trial as guaranteed by our state and federal constitutions. U.S. Const, amend. VI; Wash. Const. art. I, § 22 (providing “the accused shall have the right. . . to have a speedy public trial”); <em>State v. Paumier, </em><a href="/wash-2d/176/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="176 Wash. 2d 29" data-case-ids="4306856" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/176/0029-01">176 Wn.2d 29</a>, 34, <a href="/citations/?q=288%20P.3d%201126" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="288 P.3d 1126">288 P.3d 1126</a> (2012). We have repeatedly held that the public trial right applies to jury selection. Specifically, it is well established that the public trial right in voir dire proceedings extends to the questioning of individual prospective jurors. <em>State v. Wise, </em><a href="/wash-2d/176/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="176 Wash. 2d 1" data-case-ids="4306658" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/176/0001-01">176 Wn.2d 1</a>, 16-19, <a href="/citations/?q=288%20P.3d%201113" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="288 P.3d 1113">288 P.3d 1113</a> (2012). The right to a public trial is not absolute; a trial court may close the courtroom so long as it considers the five criteria outlined in <em>Bone-Club. </em>Failure to conduct a <em>Bone-Club </em>analysis before closing the proceeding is error generally requiring a new trial because voir dire is an inseparable part of trial. <em>Paumier, </em>176 Wn.2d at 35.</p>
    <p id="b154-7" data-blocks='[["BL_154.7",154,[191,1508,1253,852]]]'>¶6 Here, the trial court erroneously closed the courtroom when it privately questioned potential jurors during voir dire without first conducting a <em>Bone-Club </em>analysis. The State argues that this case is like <em>State v. Momah, </em><a href="/wash-2d/167/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="167 Wash. 2d 140" data-case-ids="4005246" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/167/0140-01">167 Wn.2d 140</a>, 151-52, <a href="/citations/?q=217%20P.3d%20321" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="217 P.3d 321">217 P.3d 321</a> (2009), where we found no public trial right violation. In that case, we emphasized that the defendant affirmatively assented to the closure of voir dire and actively participated in designing the trial closure. Additionally, while it was not explicit, the trial court in <em>Momah </em>effectively considered the <em>Bone-Club </em>factors. However, in this case, the trial court did not explicitly or implicitly consider the <em>Bone-Club </em>factors or acknowledge that it was closing the courtroom. The State provided the juror questionnaire that offered potential jurors a “closed hearing,” and while Coggin approved of the questionnaire, he did not actively participate in designing the trial closure.</p>

      <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>¶7 The State also argues that Coggin invited any violation of his right to a public trial. “The basic premise of the invited error doctrine is that a party who sets up an error at trial cannot claim that very action as error on appeal and receive a new trial.” <em>Momah, </em>167 Wn.2d at 153. In determining whether the invited error doctrine applies, we have considered whether the defendant affirmatively assented to the error, materially contributed to it, or benefited from it. For example, we have held that a party may not request a jury instruction and later complain on appeal that the requested instruction was given. <em>See City of Seattle v. Patu, </em><a href="/wash-2d/147/0717-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="147 Wash. 2d 717" data-case-ids="103671" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/147/0717-01">147 Wn.2d 717</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20P.3d%20273" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="58 P.3d 273">58 P.3d 273</a> (2002). In contrast, even with its unique set of facts, we held that <em>Momah </em>did not present a classic case of invited error and rejected relief based on invited error. Similarly, here, Coggin’s actions do not rise to the level of invited error by merely assenting to the State’s juror questionnaire and where it was the trial judge who decided to question jurors in chambers. Therefore, we conclude Coggin did not invite any violation of his right to a public trial.</p>

No clearer prejudice could be established.” Because we decided <em>Morris </em>on ineffective assistance of appellate counsel grounds, we <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>did not address whether a meritorious public trial right violation is also presumed prejudicial on collateral review.

    <p id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[217,570,1255,1190]]]'>¶9 As we explained in <em>In re Personal Restraint of Stockwell, </em><a href="/wash-2d/179/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="179 Wash. 2d 588" data-case-ids="4033291" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/179/0588-01">179 Wn.2d 588</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=316%20P.3d%201007" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="316 P.3d 1007">316 P.3d 1007</a> (2014), a petitioner’s burden on collateral review has evolved over the course of several decades. We have required petitioners who collaterally attack their convictions to satisfy a higher burden, recognizing that a personal restraint petition does not substitute for a direct appeal, and different procedural rules have been adopted recognizing this difference. Where a presumption of prejudice is appropriate for direct review in some cases, it may not be appropriate for collateral review. <em>Stockwell, </em>179 Wn.2d at 596-97. Even in those cases where the error would never be harmless on direct review, we have not adopted a categorical rule that would equate per se prejudice on collateral review with per se prejudice on direct review. “We have limited the availability of collateral relief because it undermines the principles of finality of litigation, degrades the prominence of trial, and sometimes deprives society of the right to punish admitted offenders.” <em>St. Pierre, </em>118 Wn.2d at 329 (denying relief where issue of defective charging documents was raised for the first time in a personal restraint petition (citing <em>In re Pers.

The petitioner’s burden to establish actual and substantial prejudice in a personal restraint petition is generally relaxed only where the error gives rise to a conclusive presumption of prejudice. <em>St. Pierre, </em>118 Wn.2d at 328. This higher standard on collateral review is met only where, in light of the essential purpose of the constitutional right at issue, a violation of the right would necessarily prejudice the defendant. <em>Morris, </em>176 Wn.2d at <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>181-82 (Wiggins, J., dissenting) (citing <em>St. Pierre, </em>118 Wn.2d at 329). For example, a petitioner need not prove harm in addition to that which is inherent in proof of the error itself when a petitioner claims ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial withholding of material exculpatory evidence. <em>Stockwell, </em>179 Wn.2d at 607 (Gordon McCloud, J., concurring). At times, we have applied the exception to the general rule that a petitioner must show actual and substantial prejudice on collateral review, but it is just that — an exception — and must be narrowly recognized and applied, lest the general rule be swallowed by the exception.</p>
    <p id="b157-4" data-blocks='[["BL_157.5",157,[123,958,1260,1292]]]'>¶11 Here, the record reflects Coggin cannot establish prejudice by any violation of his public trial right. We have stated, “The public trial right serves to ensure a fair trial, to remind the officers of the court of the importance of their functions, to encourage witnesses to come forward, and to discourage perjury.” <em>State v. Brightman, </em><a href="/wash-2d/155/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="155 Wash. 2d 506" data-case-ids="3766216" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/155/0506-01">155 Wn.2d 506</a>, 514, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20P.3d%20150" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="122 P.3d 150">122 P.3d 150</a> (2005). None of these goals are necessarily jeopardized here. While a defendant’s public trial rights are implicated by in-chambers voir dire, prejudice is not “conclusive,” nor can it be presumed on collateral review. This is so because a limited trial closure, in and of itself, does not require reversal where the trial court considers and justifies the closure after applying the <em>Bone-Club </em>factors. We cannot therefore say that a defendant will be prejudiced every time there is a closure. Here, the record establishes, Coggin was charged with rape. The trial judge and the parties were concerned with juror impartiality because the case had received significant news coverage and expressed concern that jurors potentially had prior knowledge of the crime. This private questioning perhaps worked to benefit Coggin by protecting his right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. Under these circumstances, requiring a showing of prejudice is consistent with the general rule applicable to personal restraint petitions.</p>
    <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.6",157,[129,2273,1250,99]],["BL_158.1",158,[190,342,1250,470]]]'>¶12 The interests of finality and the process underlying appellate review require us to draw a line at some point. <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>“Although some errors which result in per se prejudice on direct review will also be per se prejudicial on collateral attack, the interests of finality of litigation demand that a higher standard be satisfied in a collateral proceeding.” <em>St. Pierre, </em>118 Wn.2d at 329. While, as mentioned above, we have carved out an exception and will presume prejudice for petitioners who allege a public trial right violation by way of an ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim, we refuse to extend this exception any further.</p>
    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.5",158,[191,831,1250,933]]]'>¶13 Also, as stated above, significant policy reasons support why it is appropriate to presume prejudice stemming from a public trial right violation on direct review but not on collateral review. Collateral review is fundamentally different from a direct appeal, and different rules apply on direct review as compared to collateral review. Primarily, the appellate process exists to remedy trial errors even when constitutionally based. But after a conviction becomes final and a defendant raises a public trial right violation on collateral review, the social costs from reopening the case and retrying it are much greater. The appellate process also exists to develop the body of law governing all cases; collateral review focuses on the facts of the individual defendant, and its purpose is to correct the most egregious errors that cause actual harm. The principles of finality outweigh any public trial rights when the petitioner raises the public trial right issue for the first time on collateral review.</p>
    <p id="b158-5" data-blocks='[["BL_158.6",158,[191,1791,1249,573]]]'>¶14 Here, Coggin does not argue or establish that he was actually and substantially prejudiced, nor do the facts support that conclusion. As a result of the individual questioning of jurors, Coggin’s goal was to benefit from a more fair trial, as jurors were presumably more forthcoming about their relative experiences and their abilities to serve impartially on the jury. While it is difficult to show that a public trial right violation was prejudicial, it is not impossible in every case. Under our established rules, it is the petitioner’s burden on collateral review, which Coggin has not established.</p>

Instead, looking to the totality of the circumstances, we consider whether the party engaged in affirmative and voluntary action to induce or contribute to the error and whether he or she benefited from the trial court’s action. Constitutional error may be invited. In fact, this court has recognized the applicability of the doctrine to public trial rights cases. <em>See Wise, </em>176 Wn.2d at 15 n.8; <em>State v.

However, the factors motivating the decision to privately question the jurors were quite different. In <em>Wise, </em>the trial judge suggested questioning jurors in chambers, communicated directly with the jurors about that proposal, and orchestrated the entire process. <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel may have ultimately acquiesced to the private questioning but played no part in generating or executing the process. In contrast, in Coggin’s case it was defense counsel who expressed concern that pretrial publicity may have impacted certain venire members, that some may have trouble answering questions about the sensitive topic of rape, and that some may taint the remaining venire members with their testimony. The prosecutor then drafted a questionnaire that addressed these concerns by giving jurors the option to answer questions privately in a “closed hearing.” After suggesting one change, defense counsel approved this questionnaire. Defense counsel then actively participated in the questioning process in chambers and never voiced any objection to the procedure.</p>

In contrast, every public trial <em>violation </em>undermines the essential purposes of the public trial right because the right hinges on the openness of the process. As the lead opinion acknowledges, this case presents not a justified closure, but a public trial right violation. Lead opinion at 116.

While the lead opinion distinguishes these cases because they included allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, this distinction cannot withstand scrutiny. <em>Orange </em>and <em>Morris </em>held that the prejudice required to prove ineffective assistance of counsel was established by the structural nature of the public trial error. <em>See Orange, </em>152 Wn.2d at 814; <em>Morris, </em>176 Wn.2d at 166. Public trial error is no less structural when it is raised directly rather than through a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The petitioner stands in no different position. He is no more capable of showing the type of prejudice the lead opinion would demand than were the <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>petitioners in <em>Orange </em>and <em>Morris, </em>nor for that matter than the defendants whose counsel raised public trial error on direct appeal.

Collateral relief remains available to only a finite number of petitioners. The one-year time bar stands as a formidable obstacle to many late-recognized claims. RCW 10.73.090. To my knowledge, the public trial right has never been used to grant a personal restraint petition under any of the exceptions in RCW 10.73.100. Thus, the “problem” the lead opinion imagines will result from granting relief on collateral review is overstated, while the cost of its “solution” cannot be. Its holding disregards the essential purpose of the public trial right and departs from the steady path of our precedent since <em>Bone-Club.</em>

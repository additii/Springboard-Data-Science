Coffman, would have acquired fee simple title to all his property, had he not later executed the above codicil. We are also agreed that the codicil did not limit her power to use, expend, sell, convey or otherwise dispose of the property in her lifetime left her by his will. The difficulty of the writer has been to determine what effect the codicil had on the property left by him which had “not been used or expended by her.” The majority hold that while the estate conveyed to her in the original will was the fee, the effect of the codicil was to convert the fee originally granted into a life estate with full power of disposition, and that, if any part of the estate devised to her remained unused or unexpended at her death, it thereupon passed as directed in the codicil. Some courts hold that a life estate, coupled with unlimited power of disposition, is equivalent to a fee simple title. The great weight of authority, however, including this court, supports the rule that a life estate may be created, coupled with power of disposition, and that such power does not change the life estate into a fee for the reason that the power of disposition is not in itself an estate, but is an authority so to do derived <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>from the will.

If there is no such property, the codicil is ineffective. It does not attempt to control her in any disposition of such property during her lifetime, but is, in the view of the majority, a disposition of such of his property as may remain unused or unexpended at her death. The rule announced in the above-cited cases, as to a limitation over after a fee given, has no application here.</p>
    <p id="b483-5" data-blocks='[["BL_483.4",483,[211,1857,1200,499]],["BL_484.1",484,[292,369,1201,459]]]'>The general rule relative to the construction of a will and a codicil is stated in R. C. L., vol. 28, p. 199, as follows: “It is the well-settled general rule that a will and codicil are to be regarded as a single and entire instrument for the purpose of determining the testamentary intention and disposition of the testator, and both instruments together will be construed as if they had been executed at the time of the making of the codicil. They will not, however, be considered as a single instrument where a manifest intention requires otherwise. The <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>construction of the provisions contained in a will and codicil may be different from that which would be given to the same provisions all embodied in a will. This is due to the fact that the mere taking of a codicil gives rise to the inference of a change in intention, and such an inference does not arise in the case of a will standing by itself. When a will and codicil are inconsistent in their provisions, the codicil, being the latest expression of the testator’s desires, is to be given precedence.”</p>
    <p id="b484-3" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[291,830,1201,301]]]'>This court follows the general rule above stated. In <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Ward, </em><a href="/ark/115/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="115 Ark. 184" data-case-ids="1533757" data-case-paths="/ark/115/0184-01">115 Ark. 184</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=171%20S.W.%2090" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="171 S.W. 90">171 S. W. 90</a>, we said: “A codicil is in legal effect a republication of the will, and the whole is to be construed together as if executed at the date of the codicil.” This was quoted with approval in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Agricola, </em><a href="/ark/176/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="176 Ark. 287" data-case-ids="1399965" data-case-paths="/ark/176/0287-01">176 Ark. 287</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20S.W.2d%2026" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="3 S.W.2d 26">3 S.

    <p id="b484-4" data-blocks='[["BL_484.5",484,[288,1137,1204,745]]]'>Undoubtedly, Judge Coffman intended by his original will to give his wife all his property without any strings tied to it. They were childless, but each had a number of collateral kindred. In 1896 his fortune was of little value, but in 1923 it had grown to quite a substantial sum. Even then he tied no strings to her right to use and enjoy his property, but only to the excess or surplus. For some reason he made the codicil, which gives rise to an inference of a change in intention as to what might be done with the surplus. He might have thought, and the evidence somewhat sustains this surmise, that too much of it would go to her relations to the exclusion of his. Whatever his purpose was, it was his will or wish that his excess property go to the City Hospital, if any remained at her death.</p>

If the codicil is in conflict with the will, the codicil governs. We have many times held that, where the provisions of a will are in conflict, the last provision is controlling. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Britt, </em><a href="/ark/22/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="22 Ark. 567" data-case-ids="8727312" data-case-paths="/ark/22/0567-01">22 Ark. 567</a>; <em>McKenzie </em>v. <em>Roleson, </em><a href="/ark/28/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="28 Ark. 102" data-case-ids="1884380" data-case-paths="/ark/28/0102-01">28 Ark. 102</a>; <em>Gist </em>v. <em>Pettus, </em><a href="/ark/115/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="115 Ark. 400" data-case-ids="1533770" data-case-paths="/ark/115/0400-01">115 Ark. 400</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=171%20S.W.%20480" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="171 S.W. 480">171 S. W. 480</a>. In the latter case we held there was no necessary repugnancy between the codicil and the will, and continued, saying: “But. if we <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>are mistaken in this, and the third paragraph of the will should he construed to devise the fee simple title to John W. Pettus, then this paragraph would he manifestly inconsistent with and repugnant to the codicil, and in that case the language of the codicil would control.”</p>
    <p id="b485-2" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[195,635,1199,348]]]'>Therefore, if the codicil in this case he held to be in conflict with or repugnant to the will, which the majority does, by holding that the codicil converted the fee theretofore given into a life estate with power of disposition, then it necessarily follows that the codicil controls, and the surplus of his property at her death must go to the city for the City Hospital under his will.</p>

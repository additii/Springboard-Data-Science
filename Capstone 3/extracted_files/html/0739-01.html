Second, that, if this contention is not sound, the order creating the subdistrict is void for the reason that the county court of Jefferson County had no jurisdiction; that the act creating Salt Bayou Drainage District, in Jefferson and Arkansas counties,, vested jurisdiction of all matters pertaining to the district in: the J efferson Circuit Court, and, under act No. 270 of the General Assembly for the year 1917 (volume 2, Special Acts 1917, <a id="p741" href="#p741" data-label="741" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*741</a>page 1446) of the Special Acts of 1917, the petition for the organization of the subdistrict should have been filed in the circuit court of the couxity within which the main district was organized.</p>

There a road improvement district created by a special act, which was complete in itself, sought to enlarge its powers in the matter of issuing bonds to complete the proposed improvement by assuming the benefit of a general law which had been enacted before the creation of the road' district. The cost of the proposed improvement would have exceeded the assessed betterments unless there was read into the special act the provision of a prior general . law relating to improvement districts,, thát deferred installments of the assessed benefits should hear interest. It was held in the case cited that this could not be done, because no general law in force at the time of the enactment of the special act could have the effect of enlarging the powers of the commissioners of the road' district created by the special act.</p>

This section of the' Digest was § 18 of act 177 of the Acts of 1913 (Acts 1913, page 749), which amended the'drainage act of 1909. By this section it is provided that three or more owners of real property wholly within, or partly within and partly without, a' drainage district may petition the county court to establish a subdistrict embracing their property; and, by § 19 of the Acts .of 1913, which appears as § 3651, C.' &amp; M. Digest, it is provided that, if the prayer of the petition is granted, the county court “shall appoint the commissioners of the drainage district <a id="p742" href="#p742" data-label="742" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*742</a>in which the subdistrict, or the greater part thereof, shall lie,” to act as commissioners for the subdistrict, and that the proceedings thereafter shall conform in all respects to the provisions of the law relating- to the -creation of the original district.

It is further provided in the amendatory statute that, where the main drainage district .of which the proposed subdistrict is to become a .part, shall have been organized by the circuit court, the petition for the proposed subdistrict shall be presented to such circuit court and all subsequent proceedings had therein, and that, “where the main drainage district of which the proposed subdistrict shall embrace lands lying in another or other counties, the petition for the organization of the proposed subdistrict shall be filed in the circuit court of the county in which the main district was organized, and all subsequent proceedings shall be had in such court.”</p>
    <p id="b758-4" data-blocks='[["BL_758.5",758,[303,1697,1200,605]]]'>The insistence of appellant is that, under the statutes quoted and referred to, there is (a) no provision for the creation of the subdistrict to the district created by a special act of the General Assembly; and (b), if so, the proceedings so to do would have to be in the circuit court, for the reason that the lands composing the original district lie partly in Arkansas County and partly in Jefferson .County, and, under the special act, all proceedings relating to the assessment of benefits, etc., in the special district were to be had in the circuit, court of Jefferson County, • It is admitted that all the lands lying within the proposed subdistrict are in Jefferson- County.</p>

The landowners proceeded under the general law in organizing the subdistrict, and we perceive no reason why they may not , do so. Subdistriets -become separate entities so far'as the assessment-of the benefits necessary to construct them is concerned, and the language of § 3650, C. &amp; M. Digest, appears to be sufficiently comprehensive to permit owners of real property “wholly within a drainage district, or partly within and partly without such district,” to petition for the-establishment-of a sub-district,- even though the principal district was created by a special act of the General Assembly.</p>

"We also said.that it is necessarily implied that the improvement contemplated by a subdistrict must be such that it can be treated as part of the same unit as the improvement provided for in the original district, and not an independent improvement. There is no showing here that these conditions do not prevail concerning the district created by the special act and the subdistrict organized under the statute.</p>

It is.-true, as appears from the quotation herein .from the. amendatory act of 1917, where the main drainage district has been organized by the circuit court, the proceedings to organize a subdistrict thereto shall be in the circuit cburt, but the Salt Bayou Drainage District was not organized by' the circuit court of Jefferson County.

She asks us to determine (1) whether the trial court abused its discretion when it prohibited her from owning or living with animals as a condition of probation, (2) whether the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered her to forfeit any remaining animals to the Stevens County Sheriff’s Office after giving her 7 days to find them new homes, and (3) whether the trial court violated her due process rights by proceeding to sentencing 22 minutes after the verdict and imposing restitution to reimburse the county for animal care. We hold that the forfeiture challenge is moot, and we affirm the Court of Appeals on the remaining issues.</p>

    <p id="b136-10" data-blocks='[["BL_136.14",136,[215,1959,1250,423]]]'>¶2 Deskins lived on a property in rural Stevens County where she kept many dogs, as well as several horses, llamas, donkeys, and other animals. She kept roughly 40 dogs at any given time — often confining them together in one large fenced area. Deskins sometimes kept feral dogs on the property. Michael Benson also lived on the property in a trailer separate from the house, and he had a few animals of his own, including 1 dog.</p>
    <p id="b137-3" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[90,359,1250,426]]]'>
      <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>¶3 Several neighbors contacted police after they witnessed a series of violent incidents involving Deskins’s dogs. On May 6, 2008, some of Deskins’s dogs jumped over the fence and attacked a neighbor’s dog named Winnie. The details of the attack are gruesome. Winnie suffered major injuries and bites that nearly killed her, but she survived after a local veterinarian treated her at a cost of approximately $1,400.</p>
    <p id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[89,809,1256,423]]]'>¶4 On September 17, 2008, several neighbors witnessed the pack of dogs on Deskins’s property attack and kill one of their own. The neighbors gathered on the roadway near Deskins’s property to film the attack and report it to police. While they were there, Deskins arrived home. The neighbors saw Deskins place the dead dog in her pickup truck. Deskins became upset when she saw the crowd of neighbors and threatened to shoot them if they did not leave.</p>
    <p id="b137-5" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[87,1254,1252,805]]]'>¶5 On September 29 and October 1, neighbors witnessed and filmed two similar attacks. Each time the pack of dogs mauled and killed a smaller dog in the pack. The neighbors would try to stop the attacks by yelling at the dogs, but they did not enter the pen themselves, fearing for their safety. On October 2, one neighbor saw Deskins drive down the road with a black bag in the back of her truck. About one mile down the road, she saw Deskins’s truck stopped in the roadway. Then she saw Deskins reenter her truck and drive away. The neighbor noticed that the black bag was missing. She pulled over and found a dead dog in a black bag at the side of the road where Deskins had stopped. Police retrieved the carcass, and a veterinarian determined that the dog had been dead for several days. It had a broken femur and deep bite wounds on its neck consistent with a dog attack.</p>

The dogs were sent to SpokAnimal, a local animal rescue. SpokAnimal had to euthanize several of the dogs because they had health issues or were too aggressive. SpokAnimal held the dogs until December 24, 2008, when the Stevens County Sheriff’s Office agreed <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>to return 15 dogs in exchange for Deskins’s releasing the others to be adopted or euthanized.</p>
    <p id="b138-4" data-blocks='[["BL_138.5",138,[227,471,1252,691]]]'>¶7 Deskins was charged with four misdemeanors — one count of animal cruelty in the second degree, one count of transporting or confining animals in an unsafe manner, one count of harassment, and one count of tampering with physical evidence. Deskins was tried in district court in February 2010. Her trial lasted three days. Witnesses testified to the facts stated above and also testified that they saw Deskins’s dogs attack her donkeys and even kill one of her llamas. A SpokAnimal employee testified that it is unsafe to confine a pack of dogs in an undivided enclosure because the larger, aggressive dogs will attack smaller, subordinate ones. The jury convicted Deskins on all charges.</p>
    <p id="b138-5" data-blocks='[["BL_138.6",138,[227,1184,1247,316]]]'>¶8 Sentencing began after a 22-minute recess that followed the verdict. Deskins requested a one-week continuance to prepare for sentencing, but the court denied the motion. The trial judge cited the limited schedules of the court and, at a later hearing to reconsider sentencing, explained:</p>

The State presented videos, and victims testified about the traumatic events they witnessed. They talked about the trauma of witnessing the gruesome attacks and also about how they lost their sense of security after Deskins threatened them. Winnie’s owners talked about the $1,400.00 in veterinarian bills they paid to treat <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>her, and Captain George<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> made a statement and presented documents detailing the county’s costs for caring for the seized dogs. At that point the county had paid $21,582.21 and still owed SpokAnimal $5,940.00. These documents were not filed with the court, but the judge did review them during sentencing. Defense counsel anticipated that the court would order forfeiture of her animals and asked for time to rehome them. The State requested that Benson take care of finding new homes for the animals, and he agreed to do so. Deskins agreed to this option and asked that Benson be given 30 days to rehome the animals.</p>
    <p id="b139-4" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[89,963,1252,422]]]'>¶9 The court recessed for 74 minutes while the judge reviewed the documents related to sentencing. The court imposed a total of 850 days of confinement with 300 days suspended and 2 years of probation. It imposed several conditions on the sentence, including requiring Deskins to undergo psychological counseling, noting that it had this power under former RCW 16.52.200 (2003).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Then the court went on to say:</p>

    <p id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[228,636,1250,1418]]]'>¶10 Deskins appealed to the superior court. The superior court affirmed the convictions for transporting or confining animals in an unsafe manner and animal cruelty. It reversed and remanded for new trial the harassment conviction, and it reversed and dismissed the tampering with physical evidence conviction. The superior court also ordered the trial court to clarify some conditions of the probation and the legal authority for ordering restitution for injuries to Winnie. The Court of Appeals accepted review, and in an unpublished opinion, it reversed and remanded her conviction for animal cruelty. <em>State v.

In other cases the court may enter an order requiring the owner to forfeit the animal if the court deems the animal’s treatment to have been severe and likely to reoccur.

First, it overlooks the first subsection of the statute she cites, which says that “[t]he sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor violation of this chapter may be deferred or suspended in accordance with RCW 3.66.067 and 3.66.068, however the probationary period shall be two years.” Former RCW 16.52.200(1). Deskins was sentenced for misdemeanor violations. As mentioned above, the trial court has discretion to impose conditions of probation under <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>RCW 3.66.067 and .068 that tend to prevent future crimes. Here, the trial court used its discretion and found that letting Deskins own or live with animals could result in future crimes. Her illegal animal keeping practices harmed not only her own dogs and those in the neighborhood but also the livestock that lived on the property. Thus, the trial court had reason to extend the prohibition to owning livestock as well as pets.</p>

The portion of former RCW 16.52.200(3) that deals with probation sets a floor for what a trial court must do when it orders forfeiture — it does not set the ceiling for the entire sentence. It ensures that trial courts order a prohibition on ownership in certain cases but does not prevent them from ordering it in others. A trial court sentencing for misdemeanor violations of the cruelty to animals statute may use its discretion to set terms of probation under RCW 3.66.067 and .068, and by its own terms former RCW 16.52.200(3) applies only “[i]n addition to the penalties imposed by the court.”</p>

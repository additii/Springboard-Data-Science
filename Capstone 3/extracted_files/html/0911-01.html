The issue before us is whether Washington or Idaho law applies. The plaintiff filed this suit in Washington more than two years after the accident. If Idaho law applies, the plaintiff’s claim is time barred by Idaho’s two-year statute of limitations; if Washington law applies, the plaintiff’s claim is permitted under Washington’s three-year statute of limitations.</p>

For cases filed in Washington State, Washington law presumptively applies. <em>Burnside v.

If a conflict of law issue arises, a court must first determine that there is an actual conflict between the laws of the interested states. If there is an actual conflict, we decide which state’s law applies under the framework established in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>(Am. Law Inst. 1971). A difference between the statutes of limitations does not constitute a conflict of law. <em>Rice v. Dow Chem. Co., </em><a href="/wash-2d/124/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="124 Wash. 2d 205" data-case-ids="507090" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/124/0205-01">124 Wn.2d 205</a>, 210, <a href="/citations/?q=875%20P.2d%201213" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="875 P.2d 1213">875 P.2d 1213</a> (1994).

The trial court dismissed the suit, construing Woodward’s negligence claim against Taylor as an allegation of violation of the speed limit and reasoning that “speeding has to be based upon the rules of the road where the accident occurred.” In doing so, the trial court interpreted <em>Ellis v. Barto, </em><a href="/wash-app/82/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="82 Wash. App. 454" data-case-ids="1043795" data-case-paths="/wash-app/82/0454-01">82 Wn.

Similar to the trial court, the Court of Appeals did not evaluate whether an actual conflict of law existed in this case. Rather, the Court of Appeals focused on the most significant relationship test to determine whether Washington or Idaho substantive law applied. The Court of Appeals, applying the most significant relationship test, relied on <em>Ellis </em>for the proposition that the state in which the accident occurred generally has the greater interest in applying its law when the suit is based on a violation of that <a id="p917" href="#p917" data-label="917" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*917</a>state’s rules of the road. Finding that Woodward’s suit was based on Idaho’s rules of the road and liability issues arising from that violation, the Court of Appeals held that Idaho’s substantive law and statute of limitations applied and affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of Woodward’s claim. We granted Woodward’s petition for review.</p>

Specifically, Taylor states that because Woodward alleged in her complaint that Taylor was exceeding the maximum speed limit, then her claim has to be based on the rules of the road where the accident occurred, i.e., “the traffic laws of the state of Idaho.” However, Woodward’s sole allegation of negligence <a id="p922" href="#p922" data-label="922" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*922</a>against Taylor was that Taylor was driving too fast for the icy conditions.

More importantly, Taylor’s reading of <em>Ellis </em>overemphasizes the importance of the location of the accident to the exclusion of the other factors of the most significant relationship test from the <em>Restatement. Ellis </em>does not stand for the proposition that the law of the state where an accident occurred presumptively applies.

Washington law provides that an at-fault defendant is liable for a percentage of the plaintiff’s damages, using the percentage of fault attributed to the defendant by the trier of fact, regardless of the percentage of fault attributed to the plaintiff. RCW 4.22.070(1). <a id="p923" href="#p923" data-label="923" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*923</a>Indeed, if the plaintiff is fault-free, any at-fault defendant is jointly and severally liable for the total fault attributed to all defendants against whom judgment is entered. <em><a href="/wash-app/82/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="82 Wash.

Here, Woodward was sleeping in the rear passenger seat when Taylor lost control of the vehicle. Under these facts, which we take as true because this comes from a motion on the pleadings, it is almost inconceivable that a jury could assign more fault to Woodward that to Taylor. Thus, the result under either state’s laws would be the same—Taylor is liable to Woodward.</p>

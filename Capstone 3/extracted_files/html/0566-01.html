[Budd] told the detective he did not want his computer previewed in front of his girlfriend. The troopers agreed not to view the computer’s contents in view of [Budd’s] girlfriend. The Defendant then gave consent to entry of his home for the purpose of searching his computer.

When the officers executed this warrant, they seized several additional computers, some of which also contained child pornography. With this evidence, the State charged Budd with one count of possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct in violation of RCW 9.68A.070. Budd filed a motion to suppress the evidence from his computer, arguing in part that the search was illegal because the officers did not give him the <em>Ferrier </em>warnings before entering his home.</p>

We reject this argument, as it presents the precise scenario that we rejected in <em>Ferrier </em>and ignores article I, section 7 protections of the home. We recognized in <em>Ferrier </em>that “virtually everyone confronted by a knock and talk accedes to the request to permit a search of their home.” <em>Id. </em>at 116.

Officers must give the <em>Ferrier </em>warnings before entering the home because once they are inside the home, the resident is much less likely to withdraw consent, even if the officers do subsequently give the <em>Ferrier </em>warnings. Further, once the officers are inside the home, the officers may seize any contraband within their plain view and may be able to use information gathered from inside the home to support a search warrant that they would not otherwise be able to obtain.</p>

In both cases, the resident was not given time to reflect on the officers’ presence before being asked to give his or her consent for the officers to enter the home and search for evidence of a crime.

Detective Holmes responded, “Verbatim I don’t recall. In general, he — we told him that . . . [we] were asking him for consent and he certainly had the right to deny that consent.

Here, Detective Holmes received an anonymous cybertip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 137-51, indicating that Budd was communicating with underaged girls online, possessed child pornography on his computer, and had bragged about molesting his nine-year-old daughter. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 231-33. Detective Holmes decided to contact Budd in person out of concern for the welfare and safety of his young daughter. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 237. There is no evidence that this was merely a pretext for conducting a warrantless search. Accompanied by two plainclothes state troopers, Detective Holmes initiated contact with Budd <em>outside </em>of his home in the driveway. <em>Id. </em>at 245. While still in the driveway, Detective Holmes informed Budd of why she and the troopers were there. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 245. Budd expressed that he was not surprised because “ ‘[y]ou do it long enough, you eventually get caught’ ” and, without prompting, admitted to possessing hundreds of images of child pornography. <em>Id. </em>at 134.

Not only were the circumstances of the interaction here fundamentally different from <em>Ferrier, </em>the purpose of the troopers’ actual entry into Budd’s residence was different as well. In <em>Ferrier, </em>the police entered in order to request consent to search for contraband and/or evidence of a crime. 136 Wn.2d at 108.

      <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>¶41 The majority’s assertion that the “distinction between a search and a seizure in the context of a knock and talk is a distinction without a difference,” majority at 576, is contradicted by our case law. In fact, we rejected this very argument in <em>Khounvichai, </em>149 Wn.2d at 564-66. The defendant in that case argued that <em>Ferrier </em>warnings were required when the police entered a home to question a resident “because a police officer’s request to enter a home to talk to an occupant about an alleged offense has the same result as a request to enter to search—a warrantless ‘search’ for anything in plain view.” <em>Id. </em>at 564. Observing that “[i]t is well established that a discovery made in plain view is not a search,” we dismissed the argument that “every entry potentially involves a plain view ‘search’ ” as unavailing. <em>Id. </em>at 565-66 (relying on <em>State v. Miller, </em><a href="/wash/121/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="121 Wash. 153" data-case-ids="757435" data-case-paths="/wash/121/0153-01">121 Wash. 153</a>, 154, <a href="/citations/?q=209%20P.%209" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="209 P. 9">209 P. 9</a> (1922)). The argument should be equally unavailing here, where it is undisputed that the troopers entered in order to seize Budd’s computer, not to conduct a search of his home. If the mere fact of entry constituted a search, then <em>Ferrier </em>warnings would be required whenever police enter a home. But, as discussed above, we have explicitly declined to adopt such a rule, <em>see Ruem, </em>179 Wn.2d at 206; <em>Williams, </em>142 Wn.2d at 27-28, and we have acknowledged that there are circumstances in which <em>Ferrier </em>warnings are not required prior to entry.</p>

Detective Holmes initially requested consent to preview Budd’s computer but, at Budd’s request, agreed to seize the computer instead. When confronted by the troopers outside in his driveway, Budd asked if they had a warrant. CP at 211-12, 405. In response to Detective Holmes’ statement that she would obtain a warrant if he did not consent, Budd indicated that he did not want the troopers to search his house or his computer in front of his girlfriend. <em>Id. </em>at <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>251-53, 292. Apparently determining that a “low-key” seizure of his computer would be preferable to a full-blown search of his home pursuant to a warrant, Budd gave his consent for the troopers to enter his home for the limited purpose of seizing his computer. <em>Id. </em>at 197. This exchange indicates that Budd was not only aware of and understood his rights but, in fact, exercised them.</p>
    <p id="b640-4" data-blocks='[["BL_640.4",640,[202,744,1251,1019]]]'>¶43 Moreover, we have stated that “[w]hen police obtain consent to search a home pursuant to a ‘knock and talk’ they go through private belongings and affairs without restriction. Such an intrusion into privacy is not present, however, when police seek consensual entry to question a resident.” <em>Khounvichai, </em>149 Wn.2d at 564. Similarly, we concluded in <em>Williams </em>that “ [considering the limited purpose of the police entry [to execute an arrest warrant,] . . . this case does not resemble a ‘knock and talk’ warrantless search that <em>Ferrier </em>intended to prevent.” 142 Wn.2d at 27. The same is true where the purpose of entry is limited—by the homeowner himself—to the seizure of a specific piece of evidence. At Budd’s direction, Detective Holmes and the troopers agreed “not to open — you know, go through his entire house opening up his drawers and you know, going through his girlfriend’s stuff or whatever else that may be there. Not to ransack the house, so to speak. We just did go in, take the computer and other related media and leave.” CP at 294.</p>

We observed in <em>Ferrier </em>that the inherent coerciveness of knock and talk procedures can “be mitigated by requiring officers who conduct the procedure to warn home dwellers of their right to refuse consent to a warrantless search.” <em>Ferrier, </em>136 Wn.2d at 116.

The trial court never categorized the interaction as a knock and talk procedure and devoted the bulk of its analysis to determining the voluntariness of Budd’s consent under the “totality of the circumstances” standard rather than under <em>Ferrier. </em>CP at 406-07. We have held that the totality of the circumstances standard is used <em>outside </em>the context of knock and talk procedures. <em>See Ruem, </em>179 Wn.2d at 207; <em>Thang, </em>145 Wn.2d at 637; <em>Bustamante-Davila, </em>138 Wn.2d at 981.

Characterizing the written consent form as “reaffirming” Budd’s consent comports with the trial court’s conclusion that valid consent was obtained <em>prior </em>to entering Budd’s home. Because Budd gave consent before the authorities entered his home, the <em>Ferrier </em>form was merely an additional assurance—a “standard procedure,” <em>id. </em>at 290, that simply memorialized Budd’s prior consent in writing.</p>

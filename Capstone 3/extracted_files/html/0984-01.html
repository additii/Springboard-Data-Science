That meant nothing more than the taking of evidence in the two cases at the same time. There was no consolidation for any other purpose, and there was a separate verdict, and separate judgment in each case.</p>

S. F. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em><a href="/ark/174/0966-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="174 Ark. 966" data-case-ids="8725711" data-case-paths="/ark/174/0966-01">174 Ark. 966</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=298%20S.W.%20207" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="298 S.W. 207">298 S. W. 207</a>. Appellant calls attention, however, to the case of <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em><a href="/us/141/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="141 U.S. 589" data-case-ids="3555675" data-case-paths="/us/141/0589-01">141 U.

That case has no application, because it was a single suit by the plaintiff against the defendant to set aside several judgments, and to restrain parties from executing the judgments. Neither judgment was for a sufficient amount to remove it to the Federal court, but the aggregate was more than $3,000. It was a single suit <a id="p987" href="#p987" data-label="987" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*987</a>charging that each and all the judgments were obtained by false testimony and forged documents, and it was in fact a single suit involving more than $3,000.</p>
    <p id="b1007-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.4",1007,[186,505,1200,650]]]'>Appellant also calls attention to the case of <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Whyel Coal Co., </em><a href="/f/221/0603-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="221 F. 603" data-case-ids="3563828" data-case-paths="/f/221/0603-01">221 Fed. 603</a>. In that case the court said: “The requisite jurisdictional amount is controlled, not by State legislation as defendant would have it appear, but by the federal law, and is determined by the aggregate sum for which judgment is sought, and not by the amount named in each cause of action.” The plaintiff in that case had pleaded as a single cause of action the entire loss claimed to have been sustained for the several months covered by the contract. While there were several claims against the company, they were all combined in one suit, and the amount in controversy was, of course, the amount claimed in the suit.</p>
    <p id="b1007-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.5",1007,[185,1173,1199,352]]]'>The next case relied on by the appellant is <em>McDaniel </em>v. <em>Traylor, </em><a href="/us/196/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="196 U.S. 415" data-case-ids="8292335" data-case-paths="/us/196/0415-01">196 U.

This was also a suit in Federal court to set aside, as fraudulently obtained, certain judgments which aggregated $3,000, but no one of the judgments was for that amount. Here there was a single suit, and the amount in controversy exceeded $3,000.</p>
    <p id="b1007-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.6",1007,[183,1531,1199,341]]]'>The next and only other case relied on by appellants is <em>Field </em>v. <em>Barber Asphalt Co., </em><a href="/us/194/0618-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="194 U.S. 618" data-case-ids="3631829" data-case-paths="/us/194/0618-01">194 U.

It contends that this request should have been granted on account of appellee’s unreasonable delay in notifying the appellant of his claim for the total and permanent disability benefits. Numerous authorities are cited, and it is earnestly contended that the delay made it impossible for appellant to make investigation, and determine whether appellee was totally and permanently disabled. None of these authorities are applicable here because the policy itself expressly provides that commencing with <a id="p988" href="#p988" data-label="988" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*988</a>the anniversary of the policy next succeeding the receipt of such proof the company will waive, etc. Since there can be no recovery except for claims arising after the proof of loss, whenever proof of loss is made, the company can then investigate, and, under the terms of the policy, it becomes immaterial to determine appellee’s condition immediately after the injury, if he is in fact disabled when the proof of loss is made.</p>

It was therefore improper to instruct the jury that the payments continued throughout the time of appellee’s disability. The provisions of the policy providing for payment are plain and unambiguous. The liability attached when the disability occurred and proof of loss was made.

The provision to that effect is wholly free from the ambiguity which the court thought existed in the Marshall policy. It is true that where the terms of a policy are of doubtful meaning, that construction most favorable to the insured will be adopted. This canon of construction is both reasonable and just, since the words of the policy are chosen by the insurance company; but it furnished no warrant for avoiding hard consequences by importing into a contract an ambiguity which otherwise would not exist, or, under the guise of construction, by forcing from plain words unusual and unnatural meanings.” <em>Bergholm, </em>v. <em>Peoria Life Ins.

The superior court imposed a judgment and sentence that included discretionary legal financial obligations. On appeal to Division Two of the Court of Appeals, Marks argued that the superior court violated his constitutional right to a public trial when it allowed the parties to exercise peremptory challenges to prospective jurors in a sidebar conference during jury selection. Further, Marks challenged the superior court’s imposition of discretionary legal financial obligations on the basis that the court did not consider his present and future ability to pay. The Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Marks, </em><a href="/wash-app/184/0782-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="184 Wash.

Marks filed <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>a petition for review in this court, consideration of which the court initially stayed pending its decision in <em>State v. Love, </em><a href="/wash-2d/183/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="183 Wash. 2d 598" data-case-ids="6793315" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/183/0598-01">183 Wn.2d 598</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=354%20P.3d%20841" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="354 P.3d 841">354 P.3d 841</a> (2015). <em>Love </em>is now final, and for reasons discussed below, we grant the petition for review, affirm the convictions, and remand to the trial court for reconsideration of discretionary legal financial obligations.</p>
    <p id="b199-5" data-blocks='[["BL_199.4",199,[201,689,1253,1182]]]'>¶2 As to whether the superior court violated Marks’s right to a public trial under article I, section 22 of the Washington Constitution, the Court of Appeals held that the public trial right does not extend to sidebar conferences where peremptory challenges are exercised. <em>Marks, </em><a href="/wash-app/184/0782-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="184 Wash. App. 782" data-case-ids="4366714" data-case-paths="/wash-app/184/0782-01">184 Wn. App. at 789</a>. The court was correct in result but not in reasoning in holding that there was no public trial violation. In <em>Love, </em>we held that peremptory challenges are part of the jury selection process to which the right to a public trial extends, but we determined that when the challenges are exercised in open court and a public record is made of the challenged jurors, no courtroom closure in violation of the public trial right occurs. <em>Love, </em><a href="/citations/?q=183%20Wash.%202d%20605" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="183 Wash. 2d 605">183 Wn.2d 605</a>-07. Here, the record reflects no closure of the courtroom to the public during the peremptory challenges and immediately following the challenges, the superior court announced the selected members of the jury panel in open court. The list of challenged jurors was then made part of the public record of the trial. Thus, there was no closure of the courtroom in violation of the right to a public trial, and in result we affirm the Court of Appeals decision affirming Marks’s convictions.</p>

The record in this case reflects no such inquiry at <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>the sentencing hearing, and the judgment and sentence form contains only boilerplate findings of ability to pay, which we held in <em>Blazina </em>to be inadequate. <em>Id. </em>at 838.

Rep. on Substitute H.B. 1284, 63d Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>2013) (SHB 1284). One critical provision in those amendments requires the dependency court to consider several factors <em>“[i]f </em>the parent <em>is </em>incarcerated.” RCW 13.34.180(1)(f) (emphasis added). Those factors bar a court from assuming that incarceration will make it impossible to parent; they focus instead on the sufficiency of the Department of Social and Health Services’ (Department) services and the parent’s efforts, requiring the court to evaluate those things on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[201,855,1247,424]]]'>¶2 Petitioner Edelyn Saint-Louis was incarcerated in the middle of a dependency proceeding that lasted just over 2 years, but was released 1 month and 10 days before the termination trial began. The main question presented here is one of statutory interpretation: Does RCW 13.34.180(1)(f)’s requirement that certain factors be considered at the termination hearing “[i]f the parent is incarcerated” apply if the parent isn’t incarcerated at that time?</p>
    <p id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[202,1304,1247,737]]]'>¶3 We hold, based on the language and purpose of the amendments, that the answer is no. Other portions of the amended statute already require the Department to offer adequate services to all parents (incarcerated or not), and other portions of the amended statute already bar termination if the Department has failed to offer such services to parents (incarcerated or not); hence, other portions of the statute already ensure that the parent’s history (including past incarceration) is considered and accommodated. The provision at issue in this case, by contrast, looks to the incarcerated parent’s ability to parent in the future. Limiting its application to those incarcerated at the time of the termination hearing thus fits well into the statutory scheme.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In February 2012, D.L.B. was taken into protective custody and Saint-Louis entered a voluntary agreement placing D.L.B. in temporary (30-day) foster care. Saint-Louis also told department social workers that she planned to move from Seattle to Chicago to live with D.L.B.’s father and paternal aunt. But the Department soon learned that a lifetime no-contact order barred D.L.B.’s father from contacting both Saint-Louis and D.L.B.</p>

The dependency court ordered Saint-Louis to obtain a psychological evaluation with a parenting component, follow the recommended treatment, participate in a domestic violence support group, submit to random urine analyses (UAs) for 90 days, and obtain a drug and alcohol evaluation. The court also allowed Saint-Louis to have two supervised visits with D.L.B. per week, with the possibility of more visits to be worked out in consultation with D.L.B.’s court-appointed special advocate (CASA).</p>

He recommended that Saint-<a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>Louis obtain a medical consultation regarding medication for her disorders and a drug and alcohol evaluation to address her alcohol and cannabis use, that she enroll in a parenting class called the “Incredible Years” parent education program, and that she attend a domestic violence support group. Tutty’s report stated that “[i]t is expected that [Saint-Louis will] complete these services <em>in the next six months” </em>and recommended that reunification with D.L.B. not occur unless Saint-Louis made “significant progress in . . . mood regulation, sobriety, parenting skills, and stable housing” during that time.

She then met twice with Alyssa Livingston, the department social worker assigned to D.L.B.’s dependency, to make a formal service plan. This plan included outpatient addiction treatment with random UAs, participation in the Incredible Years program and a domestic violence support group, and mental health counseling.</p>

She completed a formal outpatient addiction treatment program but was never able to complete the required 90 days of clean UAs afterward. She completed participation in a domestic violence support group, but not the Incredible Years program, even though she was referred to it four different times. Saint-Louis also regularly missed scheduled visitations with D.L.B.</p>
    <p id="b146-6" data-blocks='[["BL_146.6",146,[201,1879,1248,484]]]'>¶11 In May 2013, the Department held another meeting with Saint-Louis. Livingston and others at this meeting explained to Saint-Louis how serious her situation was given that D.L.B. had already been in foster care for over 12 months, but they also told Saint-Louis that they would give her three more months before referring the case for termination. They told Saint-Louis that they needed to see significant progress during these months or the Department would not agree to reunification.</p>

She was arrested, spent a month in jail (July 2013 to August 2013), and was then released to a jail alternative (King County’s Community Center for Alternative Programs (CCAP)).</p>

Meanwhile, in the criminal case, Saint-Louis violated CCAP’s requirements and was returned to jail on November 21, 2013, pending trial.</p>

Saint-Louis testified that she was 5 weeks along in the 18-week Incredible Years program when she returned to jail. Livingston testified that Saint-Louis was not engaged in any required services between the planning meeting in May 2013 and her return to jail in November 2013, even though Saint-Louis was incarcerated for only 1 of those 6 months.</p>
    <p id="b147-6" data-blocks='[["BL_147.6",147,[201,1579,1248,800]],["BL_148.1",148,[202,345,1247,594]]]'>¶15 Saint-Louis pleaded guilty on December 16, 2013, to hit-and-run (attended), a gross misdemeanor, and vehicular assault and taking a car without permission, both felonies. In January 2014, she was sentenced to 12 months for one felony and 3 months for the other. The sentencing court allowed Saint-Louis to serve her entire term on work release, which would have enabled her to participate in all court-ordered dependency services. But Saint-Louis actually participated in work release for only 22 days over two separate periods. The first period of work release was from March 17 to March 25; this ended because Saint-Louis violated a work release requirement. The second period was for 15 days, beginning April 11, 2014. At some point during these 15 days, Saint-Louis met with Livingston to discuss visitation, reenrollment in the Incredible Years program, <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>and other services. Livingston once again referred her for the required services. But before Saint-Louis could begin any of them, she again violated the conditions of her release and it was revoked. The trial court offered to reinstate work release almost immediately, but Saint-Louis declined. She chose to finish her sentence in total confinement instead. She testified that she knew this meant she would not see D.L.B. until her sentence expired about two months later. She also knew that she would not be able to provide the required UAs if she relinquished work release, but could provide them if she remained on work release.</p>
    <p id="b148-4" data-blocks='[["BL_148.4",148,[202,965,1246,636]]]'>¶16 In jail, Saint-Louis received one-on-one mental health services twice a week from November 2013 (the beginning of her sentence) until March 2014 (the first time she attempted work release). She also voluntarily participated in domestic violence classes. Saint-Louis testified that the jail had other structured services, including a chemical dependency program, but that the domestic violence class was the only one available to her. Livingston testified that she contacted the jail to find out what services Saint-Louis could receive there, and that the only services to which she could refer Saint-Louis in jail were the mental health services.</p>

At the termination hearing, Saint-Louis claimed that she had already enrolled in the Incredible Years program, relapse prevention and anger management programs, and mental health counseling. She did not inform the Department about her participation in any of these services, however, until she testified at the termination hearing. Saint-Louis also moved in with her boyfriend, a man with a history of domestic violence; Saint-Louis was expecting a baby with this man, due in March 2015. On the first day of the termination hearing, Saint-Louis testified that she lived with her mother. That’s what she had been telling the Department during the dependency. On the second day, <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>however, when confronted with contradictory information, Saint-Louis admitted for the first time that she was actually living with this man.</p>

At the time of trial (July 28, 2014 through August 5, 2014), Saint-Louis had been in the relapse prevention program for one week. She was also enrolled in the Incredible Years program (which had not yet started at the time of trial), an anger management program, and one-on-one mental health counseling.

The termination court is still required to <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>consider and accommodate a parent’s <em>prior </em>incarceration before ruling on the fifth prerequisite to termination (likelihood that reunification can occur in the near future).

Nothing would have appeared but ,an endorsement in September, 1841 and demand, refusal and notice at some unknown time in 1842 or 1843 and no excuse at all for such gross negligence.</p>
    <p id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.6",511,[213,1894,1201,144]]]'>It is perfectly clear then that 'the finding and judgment of the court against the evidence in this case was without testimony to sustain it.</p>

There was proof that one copy of this written notice was lost or destroyed, but there was no such proof as to the other copy, nor had the endorser been notified to' produce it on trial. One or the other was necessary to authorize secondary evidence of <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>the contents of the paper. The court therefore erred in admitting parol testimony of the contents of the written notice.</p>

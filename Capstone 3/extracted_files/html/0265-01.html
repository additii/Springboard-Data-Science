Small payments had been made on this note which had kept it alive as a subsisting obligation.</p>

The trustee was not able to render this attention, and, at a family conference, the subject of mortgaging the lot was considered, hut they were unable to° secure a satisfactory or sufficient loan, as the funeral expenses and a few small debts which Selvy owed had not been paid.</p>

That case is not in point, however, for the reason that the testimony was not offered to show that appellant’s debt was excepted from those which were to be paid, but the testimony was offered to show that appellant had no debt, hers having been canceled, as stated above. This testimony was admissible to show what the debts were and that appellant had no debt, and was not admitted to show that appellant’s debt was excepted from those which were to be paid.</p>

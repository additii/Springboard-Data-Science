We review a published Court of Appeals decision affirming the summary dismissal of petitioner Rachel Anderson’s breach of trust action against the trustee and two members of a committee charged with making trust disbursements, and her malpractice action against the attorney hired to file annual <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>trust accountings with the superior court. We hold that because Rachel was not represented by a guardian ad litem when the court approved the trust’s annual accountings, she did not have notice of these proceedings and accordingly can now bring a breach of trust action under TEDRA. We reverse the Court of Appeals, vacate its award of attorney’s fees, and remand for further proceedings.</p>

Rachel also challenges the trust’s purchase of computers and related software. She argues that these computers and software were used by the entire family and as such were a natural parental expense not at all related to her disability. Next, Rachel contests the procedures the trust used to purchase a house in the name of her mother’s then boyfriend. She argues that the process surrounding the purchase of the house violated express provisions for “major purchases” contained in the trust agreement. Rachel also challenges the use of trust money to purchase birthday gifts that Rachel contends was actually used for new carpeting and a swimming pool.

The court reasoned that Rachel’s claims were barred by RCW 11.106.080, a provision of the TAA that makes court approval of an accounting final and binding on all parties, even incompetent beneficiaries. Because the superior court had approved all the accountings and Rachel never appealed those approvals, she could not now pursue breach of trust claims based on conduct disclosed in those accountings.

Under this provision, the beneficiary has three years from the date she or her personal representative was sent a report that adequately discloses the potential for a breach of trust claim. TEDRA details the information that must be included in this report in order to impute notice of a potential claim to the beneficiary. One piece of required information is a statement explaining to the beneficiary that she has a right under the TAA to request that an accounting be filed with the superior court.

Though the superior court did not err by failing to appoint a guardian for Rachel when it considered her trust accountings, a question remains whether a breach of trust claim that would be timely brought under TEDRA is barred by the TAA provision establishing the finality of accountings filed with the court.</p>
    <p id="b411-5" data-blocks='[["BL_411.5",411,[102,888,1249,477]]]'>|21 To answer this question, our analysis must begin with the plain language of the TAA and TEDRA. <em>Id. </em>at 11 (“Where a statute is unambiguous, the court assumes the legislature means what it says and will not engage in statutory construction past the plain meaning of the words.”). Read together, the plain language of the TAA and TEDRA reveal a legislative intent that minor beneficiaries have notice only where the court appoints a guardian ad litem or they have a valid virtual representative.</p>

RCW 11.96A.070. Notice of the potentiality of a claim is accomplished by the trustee sending the beneficiary or her representative a report containing specified information. Among other things, the report must contain a statement that the beneficiary has the right to demand an accounting with the court under the TAA. RCW 11.96A.070(l)(b)(vii). But this statute of limitations is tolled, and notice is therefore not imputed, where the beneficiary is a minor without an appointed guardian. RCW 11.96A.070(4). Accordingly, notice of a potential claim, which by definition requires notice of the ability to demand a TAA accounting, is not imputed to the beneficiary until she reaches the age of majority or has a guardian appointed. Here, because the court never appointed Rachel a guardian, she did not receive legal notice of her potential breach of trust claim or her right to demand an accounting <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>under the TAA, until she turned 18.

When any TAA accounting is filed, the court is required to issue a detailed notice. This notice must specify the time and place for the return date, include the names of the trustee, and ask that any objections be filed by the return date. RCW 11.106.050. Additionally, the notice must be personally served on all parties or their virtual representatives. <em>Id.; </em>RCW 11.96A-.110. Meanwhile, a related provision of TEDRA defines “virtual representation” to include both guardians and parents, but the statute specifically provides that a conflict of interest defeats virtual representation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Immediately after detailing the procedures for notice, the TAA outlines procedures for appointing guardians and representatives in order to facilitate the beneficiary’s ability to respond to the accounting before the court rules on it. RCW 11.106.060. Here, Rachel did not have a guardian ad litem and never personally received notice of any of the accountings that occurred during her minority. Her mother’s notice of the accountings cannot qualify as virtual representation because of the existing conflict of interest between Rachel and her mother. Accordingly, Rachel never received proper notice of the ongoing accountings. Though respondents are correct that the appointment of guardians is discretionary under both the TAA and TEDRA, there must be a conse<a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>quence for initiating an accounting proceeding without one. Just as a minor does not have notice of her ability to bring a TEDRA breach of trust claim if she does not have a guardian, we hold that minors without an appointed guardian or other valid virtual representative lack notice of any ongoing accounting proceedings.</p>

State, </em><a href="/wash-2d/175/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="175 Wash. 2d 457" data-case-ids="4024391" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/175/0457-01">175 Wn.2d 457</a>, 470, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20P.3d%20873" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="285 P.3d 873">285 P.3d 873</a> (2012); Michael Sinclair, A Guide to Statutory Interpretation 138 (2000). Thus, even if one concludes that the plain language of TEDRA and the TAA cannot be squared, TEDRA, as the later statute more specific to Rachel’s breach of trust action, would control. And TEDRA explicitly tolls the statute of limitations during minority where no guardian has been appointed.</p>

Respondents hinge their argument on the language of finality contained in the TAA and the interpretation of this language in a Court of Appeals case, <em>In re Testamentary Trs. for Barovic, </em><a href="/wash-app/128/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="128 Wash.

But <em>Barovic, </em>while recognizing that a TAA accounting cannot be revised once approved by the court, in fact supports the allowance of an independent cause of action for breach of trust. Though the <em>Barovic </em>court did hold that Barovic relinquished his right to recover sums that should have been reported on past accounting statements because the TAA accountings were final and Barovic never appealed, the court also noted that Barovic did not file an action for breach of fiduciary duty under TEDRA. <em><a href="/citations/?q=114%20P.3d%201230" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="114 P.3d 1230">Id.</a> </em>at 202 n.7 (“Barovic claims that Pemberton breached her fiduciary duty. But he never filed an action for breach of fiduciary duty. <em>See </em>RCW 11.96A.070(l)(a) (actions for breach of fiduciary duty have three-year statutes of limitation).”). <em>Barovic </em>supports our reading of the statutes.</p>

He contends that Rachel accepted the benefits of the trust distributions, which were approved and finalized by the court, and that she cannot now complain after the fact that those benefits were improperly administered. Resp’t Dussault’s Suppl. Br. at 13-14. But judicial estoppel requires a party to take inconsistent positions at two judicial proceedings. <em>See Arkison v. Ethan Allen, Inc., </em><a href="/wash-2d/160/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="160 Wash. 2d 535" data-case-ids="3631109" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/160/0535-01">160 Wn.2d 535</a>, 538-39, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20P.3d%2013" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="160 P.3d 13">160 P.3d 13</a> (2007). Rachel has never taken a position in court inconsistent with the one she asserts here. She was not a party to any of the approved accountings because she was a minor and no guardian ad litem had been appointed. Judicial estoppel does not apply.</p>

Resp’t Dussault’s Answer to Pet. for Review at 14-16; Wells Fargo Bank, NA’s Resp. to Pet. for Review at 11-12. Neither collateral estoppel nor res judicata apply because here the issues and claims are not being relitigated but rather were appealed first to the Court of Appeals and are now on review in this court. An appeal is not a second adjudication for collateral estoppel or res judicata purposes. <em>See Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Ctr. v. Holman, </em><a href="/wash-2d/107/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="107 Wash. 2d 693" data-case-ids="1192526" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/107/0693-01">107 Wn.2d 693</a>, 708, <a href="/citations/?q=732%20P.2d%20974" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="732 P.2d 974">732 P.2d 974</a> (1987) (rejecting the argument that the release of a cotrustee compromises an appeal as to the remaining trustee); <em>Miller v.

Because she did not have a guardian ad litem when her trust accountings were filed with and approved by the court, she did not have the required notice of those proceedings and so cannot now be barred by them. TEDRA’s three-year statute of limitations is tolled for minors without guardians, and Rachel’s claims are timely under this provision. In addition to the issues of judicial estoppel and preclusion addressed above, respondents urge us to decide several other contingent arguments raised, but not decided, at the Court of Appeals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Though this court may review de novo all trial court errors of law, here the trial court’s summary judgment hearing and order suggest it thought Rachel’s claim was barred by the TAA.

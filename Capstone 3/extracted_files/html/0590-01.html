The New Rule, however, interprets “sale, purchase, or lease” in RCW 70.38.105(4)(b) to mean “any transaction in which the control, either directly or indirectly, of part or all of any existing hospital changes to a different person,” which encompasses much more than just mergers. WAC 246-310--010(54). As the Association correctly points out, the New Rule applies to <em>any </em>change of control because “[a]n indirect change of control would include things like changes in the stock ownership of a publicly-held corporation, or a simple change in the composition of a board of directors managing the affairs of an entity.” Corrected Answering Br. of Resp’t Wash.

Accordingly, the New Rule interprets “sale, purchase, or lease” in RCW 70.38.105(4)(b) in a manner that departs too far from the plain meaning of those terms. <em>See Swinomish, </em>178 Wn.2d at 586-87; <em>Bostain, </em>159 Wn.2d at 713, 715-16.

A defendant must overcome a heavy burden in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance; he must demonstrate that his attorney’s performance was professionally deficient and that he suffered prejudice as a result.

Thirteen days later, C.C. underwent a medical examination and was interviewed by child forensic interviewer Cornelia Thomas. The forensic interview lasted just over 40 minutes. A DVD (digital video disk) of the interview was introduced as an exhibit at Carson’s trial. The jury viewed the video of the forensic interview three times: once during Thomas’s testimony at trial and twice during its deliberations after sending requests for the video to the court.</p>

C.C. also said that Carson attempted to put his “business” in C.C.’s “bottom” while they were in his “mom’s room,” which he also referred to as his “mom and dad’s” room. At some point during this assault, Carson put tape on C.C.’s mouth and used zip ties to tie C.C.’s hands behind his back. In the third incident that C.C. described, Carson attempted to put his “business” into C.C.’s “bottom” in C.C.’s own room after making C.C. look at his Spider-Man blanket.</p>

Defense counsel had then suggested that the instruction might not be necessary because the evidence showed “three separate and distinct, identifiable acts.” On the second day of trial, the parties discussed their proposed instructions with the court, including the State’s <em>Petrich </em>instruction. Defense counsel argued that the instruction was unnecessary because the evidence pointed to “three separate and distinct incidents, one in [C.C.’s] room, one in his mother’s room, and one in the bathroom.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Defense counsel argued that reading the <em>Petrich </em>instruction could cause jury confusion:</p>

As defense counsel noted, that instruction’s statement that <em>“one particular </em>act... must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt” made little sense in Carson’s case because Carson was charged with <em>three </em>separate counts of child molestation. The confusion was exacerbated by the final sentence of <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>the instruction, which would have informed the jury that it “need not unanimously agree that the defendant committed all the acts of Child Molestation in the First Degree.” As defense counsel argued, “If you read that instruction, it confuses the jury into thinking, well, if you agree that one act happened, then you must agree that all of them happened.” At best, then, the instruction would have been confusing and it would have failed to ensure that the jury relied on a separate act for each count. At worst, the instruction would have been highly prejudicial to Carson.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The record firmly demonstrates that these concerns were the animating force behind defense counsel’s objection to a <em>Petrich </em>instruction.</p>

At best, then, the <em>Petrich </em>instruction was irrelevant to the defense’s broader trial strategy; at worst, it could have actively undercut that strategy.

The State specifically disclaimed its intention to rely on any other instances where Carson may have attempted to put his penis in C.C.’s bottom, stating that it was only “focusing on” the incidents in C.C.’s room and Hagen’s room and telling the jury that those were the only incidents that the State “would like you to focus on for the purposes of your deliberations.”</p>

It is not clear that the mention of “a closet” referred to a separate incident from the zip-ties- and-tape incident because Hagen testified that she was not sure whether C.C. was referring to “one incident or more” when he first disclosed Carson’s abuse. Moreover, C.C.’s testimony during trial showed that he had great difficulty remembering any specifics regarding the instances of sexual abuse. Because the record contains minimal detail regarding the references to an “office” and a “closet,” it is difficult to determine whether these constituted separate incidents from the three that C.C. described in his videotaped interview rather than simply a sign that C.C. had trouble remembering where and how each incident occurred.

The concurrence would be considerably more helpful to the reader if it did not ignore what we have actually said in this opinion.

It is this factor that distinguishes this case from <em>Vander Houwen. </em>As discussed <em>supra </em>note 2, the evidence in this case points to only three separate and distinct incidents. The concurrence claims that our opinion makes a “sweeping general assertion that where the number of counts charged is the same as the number of acts alleged, that congruence makes <em>Petrich </em>inapplicable.’’ Concurrence (Gordon McCloud, J.) at 233.

And <em>Hayes </em>does not include a specific model instruction. Rather, one note in <em>Hayes </em>quotes bits and pieces from three separate instructions, which the court never analyzes other than to observe that “[t]he trial court... complied with the requirement to properly instruct the jury.” <a href="/wash-app/81/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="81 Wash.

In short, <em>Hayes </em>includes neither a model instruction nor any meaningful analysis of the instructions given. Furthermore, the <em>Borsheim </em>instruction’s admonition that the jury must “ “unanimously agree as to which act or acts have been proved’ ” does not actually require the jury to use a <em>separate </em>act for each count. <em>Borsheim, </em><a href="/wash-app/140/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="140 Wash.

As the Court of Appeals has noted, the <em>Noltie </em>instruction fails to make it clear that “the jury must agree on the <em>same </em>act for each count.” <em>Watkins, </em><a href="/wash-app/136/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="136 Wash.

Carson, </em><a href="/wash-app/179/0961-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="179 Wash. App. 961" data-case-ids="4105992" data-case-paths="/wash-app/179/0961-01">179 Wn.

    <p id="b277-6" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[202,1015,1252,97]]]'>¶57 This seems like an overly formalistic assessment of how a criminal defense lawyer’s theory of the case works.</p>
    <p id="b277-7" data-blocks='[["BL_277.6",277,[201,1135,1253,468]]]'>¶58 First, the majority’s theory ignores the presence of instruction 3, which advised the jurors that they “must decide each count separately” and that their “verdict on one count should not control [their] verdict on any other count.” Clerk’s Papers at 63. It is unclear why defense counsel would have objected to a unanimity instruction on the basis that it distinguished between the charges while ignoring an instruction that explicitly required the jury to make just such a distinction.</p>
    <p id="b277-8" data-blocks='[["BL_277.7",277,[202,1633,1246,746]],["BL_278.1",278,[201,345,1253,151]]]'>¶59 Second, the majority is incorrect in asserting that a unanimity instruction would have been inconsistent with the general defense strategy of attacking the accuser’s credibility. Carson argued that the jury should not convict on any count at all; the unanimity instruction would have told the jury that it also could not convict on any single count unless every juror unanimously agreed on the incident forming the basis for that count. Success on the first theory depends on discrediting the victim’s testimony as to all three alleged incidents; success on the second theory depends on discrediting the victim’s testimony as to any one, two, or three of those same incidents. The second argument is not inconsistent with the first. In fact, they are completely consistent: they both depend on discrediting the <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>victim. Far from contradicting the general defense, the unanimity instruction would have added an extra layer of protection for the defendant’s constitutional rights.</p>
    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[201,520,1247,954]]]'>¶60 As noted above, defense counsel did express a legitimate concern about confusing the jury—he feared that in a multicount case, the standard <em>Petrich </em>instruction might confuse the jury into thinking that if it convicted on one count, it must convict on all counts. <em>See </em>majority at 219-20. But defense counsel could have addressed this confusion without also jeopardizing his client’s right to a unanimous verdict. He could have requested an instruction like the one in <em>Hayes, </em>which tells the jurors that they can convict on any one count only if they unanimously agree that the defendant committed the act supporting that count on “ <em>‘an occasion separate and distinct from that charged in [the remaining counts]! </em>” <a href="/wash-app/81/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="81 Wash.

Our cases clearly support the giving of such an instruction in cases involving not just single counts but also multiple counts. <em>See State v.

    <p id="b278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[201,1505,1253,314]]]'>¶61 For these reasons, I would hold that defense counsel’s objection to a jury unanimity instruction constituted deficient performance. I agree with the dissent in the Court of Appeals that “basing a decision on an erroneous view of the law can [not] be characterized as a <em>legitimate </em>trial tactic.” <em>Carson, </em><a href="/wash-app/179/0961-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="179 Wash.

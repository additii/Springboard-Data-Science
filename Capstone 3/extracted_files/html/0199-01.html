The opinion shows that there were similar allegations in the answer, or cross-complaint, of the defendant with respect to fraudulent or illegal votes in townships other than those named in the complaint, and, without deciding the point expressly concerning the application of this statute, it was held proper to investigate charges thus made in <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>order to determine which of the parties had rightfully received the nomination. In the opinion attention is called to the fact that “the real inquiry in election contests was as to whether the contestant or the respondent received the highest number of legal votes, and was not confined to the ground specified in the contestant’s notice of contest,” citing <em>Govan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em><a href="/ark/32/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="32 Ark. 553" data-case-ids="1877113" data-case-paths="/ark/32/0553-01">32 Ark. 553</a>.

Being the holder of a certificate of nomination, he cannot initiate a contest, and any allegations made by him in a contest instituted by an adversary are necessarily matters of defense, whether presented in an answer or in the form of a cross-complaint. A contestee, for the purpose of raising issues of fact concerning the true result of an election, may present new matter without being required to comply with the statute with respect to the time and manner of instituting the contest.

The statute (Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, § 3767) provides that the central committee shall convene at noon on Friday following the primary, and that the returns-shall be delivered to the committee on or before that time. Section 3768 reads as follows:</p>

The committee adjourned over to August 17 for the purpose of recount, and the meeting was so held, and, as before stated, the certificate of nomination was awarded to appellee. The argument of appellant’s counsel is that the statute is mandatory, and that any certificate issued after Monday following the primary is void. The general rule established by the authorities on this subject is that statutory requirements as to the time of completing the canvass of an election and the issuance of certificates concerning same are directory, and .that strict compliance is not essential. 20 C. J. 199. There is nothing in the form or subject-matter of this statute that is sufficient to take it out of the operation of that rule. On the contrary, we think that a mandatory application of this statutory requirement might result so disastrously that the Legislature could not have had in mind a strict enforcement to the extent of rendering the result of an election illegal merely because the committee had not acted within the statutory time. The language of the statute manifests an intention on the part of the lawmakers to require expedition in ascertaining and declaring the result of a primary election, but the statute does not declare the certificate of the election <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>to be void on account of failure to comply with, tbe statute as to time for the certification.

    <p id="b231-4" data-blocks='[["BL_231.5",231,[208,991,1213,1081]]]'>One of the rules of the Democratic party provides that if any person presents himself to vote “who is known to have voted against a Democratic nominee at a general election, held within two years last preceding, or who by his words or action has espoused the cause of other than Democratic nominees preceding a general or special election within said time, his right to vote at such Democratic primary may be questioned by any well known Democrat or by any of the election officials, and, upon satisfactory proof of such person’s action, the said judge shall prohibit such person from voting at such primary election.” It appears in the proof that the ten persons were qualified electors, but that at the regular biennial election in 1920 these persons had signed a petition of nomination of independent candidates for justice of the peace in opposition to the Democratic nominees, and had voted for such independent candidates. Counsel contend, in the first place, that this rule is void because it is an unreasonable restriction upon the constitutional right to vote, and that such restriction cannot be imposed by party rules.</p>

    <p id="b232-3" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[296,812,1218,768]]]'>It is urged that the ten persons in question had hot violated the party rules, and that the rejection of their ballots was not authorized by those rules. The contention is that the circuit court of Lincoln County had declared the whole election invalid on account of the failure of the clerk to publish a list of voters, and that there were therefore no Democratic nominees before the people at the regular election. This contention is not sound, for the judgment of the circuit court only related to a contest for the office of sheriff, and, whether rightfully so or not, the nominees for other offices were dute' certified as Democratic nominees. The refusal to abide by the nominations certified constituted an infraction of party rules and barred those persons from voting at the next Democratic primary election.</p>

A solution of this question turns upon the interpretation and validity of a section of the statute (Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, § 3777), which reads, in part, as follows:</p>

Whether or not a statutory restriction upon the right to vote in a party primary could be declared to be unreasonable and violative.of a natural right or as being wrongfully discriminatory, we need not decide in this case, for the statute now under consideration does not restrict the right of a voter, but it merely regulates the method of voting and the preservation of the evidence of an elector’s right to vote.</p>

This requirement rests upon the voter himself, as well as a duty imposed upon the election officers. The individual voter is chargeable with knowledge of the law, and, when his name does not appear on the certified list, he must prove, in the manner prescribed by statute, his qualification as an elector so as to entitle him to vote, and if he fails to do so, his ballot may be rejected, and if permitted to vote by the judges without presentation and preservation of such evidence, his ballot may be rejected on a contest in the court. ¡But it is further contended that, if the election officers permit a voter whose name is not on the certified list to vote without furnishing other evidence of his qualification, the court has no right to reject the ballot on a contest. This contention is in the face of the statute itself, which expressly provides that the court may reject the ballot where the evidence of the qualification of the voter has not been preserved in the manner prescribed by statute. This is a matter entirely within legislative con<a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>trol, and we perceive no reason why the Legislature should not prescribe such a method of preserving the evidence of a voter’s qualifications and for the rejection of a ballot not supported by such evidence. Appellant proved in the trial that these thirty electors were duly qualified, twenty-three of whom had paid poll-tax, and that the other seven were young men who had come of age since assessing time, but this is not sufficient, in the face of the statute, which requires other evidence. The lawmakers had a good reason for prescribing this requirement concerning the qualifications of electors whose names do not appear on published lists. The reason is that it may be difficult, after an election is over and a contest arises, to produce proof <em>pro </em>and <em>con </em>as to the qualifications of a voter, but, if that evidence is produced at the time of the election and preserved, all uncertainty on the subject is eliminated. This makes the provision a reasonable one and in the interest of fairness in elections.</p>

Rather than imposing a duty to control a person’s conduct, plaintiffs contend that the take charge duty imposes a broad duty to “to use reasonable care to protect against reasonably foreseeable dangers [the offender] posed.” Resp’ts’ Suppl. Br. at 13, 20. In theory, this could include all reasonably foreseeable dangers, even those that might occur long after the take charge duty has ended. For support, plaintiffs point to language in <em>Taggart </em>and <em>Joyce </em>where we summarized the duty that results from a take charge relationship. Taken out of context, one could read the individual sentences as imposing such a broad duty. However, a thorough reading of those cases reveals that they did not create such a radical expansion of the take charge duty.

By some estimates, the recidivism rate is well over 50 percent. <em>See </em>Matthew R. Durose, Alexia D. Cooper &amp; Howard N.

Thus, one could argue that in almost any case, it is foreseeable that an inmate may commit another crime after release. Are jails civilly liable for those crimes if they failed to take adequate measures to prevent that foreseeable recidivism? Such an expansive interpretation is not supported by the <em>Restatement </em>sections or a thorough reading of our precedent.</p>

This duty was owed during the time when Skagit County had a take charge relationship with Zamora. Skagit County owed this duty to anyone who might foreseeably suffer bodily harm resulting <em>from the failure to control </em>Zamora. Skagit County did not owe such a duty for harms unrelated to its duty to control Zamora. The trial court correctly held that as a matter of law, the crimes Zamora committed after his lawful release were not a foreseeable consequence of any failure to control Zamora during incarceration.

First, there may be situations in which a jail’s failure to control an inmate results in fore<a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>seeable injury to others, and the jail may be liable even if that injury occurs after the duty to control ended. For instance, a jail could fail to control a violent inmate by negligently allowing him or her to escape one week before he or she was scheduled to be released. Even if the inmate injured others after the scheduled release date (and thus after the jail’s duty to control had theoretically ended), the jail might still be liable if its failure to control the inmate during incarceration was the proximate cause of the injuries. Such a situation would be analogous to <em>Petersen, </em>in which a psychiatrist failed to adequately control a patient. 100 Wn.2d at 424-25. In that case, a psychiatrist discharged an involuntarily detained patient. The patient stopped taking his medications and injured the plaintiff in a car accident five days after he was released. <em>Id. </em>at 424. We found that this was a violation of the psychiatrist’s duty to control the patient, as the psychiatrist chose to release the patient rather than seeking additional involuntary confinement.

A parolee, by definition, is <em>not </em>within the State’s immediate physical control, and we specifically rejected the argument that the duty imposed by § 319 is limited to custodial relationships involving physical control over a person. <em>Id. </em>at 223. Nevertheless, we held “that the State has a duty to <em>take reasonable precautions </em>to protect against reasonably foreseeable dangers posed by the dangerous propensities of parolees,” <em>id. </em>at 217 (emphasis added), and we evaluated the scope of those reasonable precautions in light of the actual scope of the State’s authority over parolees, <em>id. </em>at 219-20. Our subsequent case law has adhered to this approach of evaluating the actual relationship giving rise to a § 319 duty to determine its proper scope. <em>See, e.g., Osborn v.

Skagit County’s own mental health counselor recommended a reasonable step that Skagit County could have taken—having a medical doctor try to talk to Zamora about psychiatric medication. CP at 3685. While a doctor approved a prescription for Lamictal, it is not clear whether any doctor ever met with Zamora to address his fears or to evaluate whether Lamictal was an appropriate medication in light of Zamora’s known symptoms and barriers to treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 2539-40, 2544-45. Moreover, § 319 unquestionably imposes “a duty to protect foreseeable victims of criminals, mental patients, and others <em>leaving </em>its custody.” <em>Osborn, </em>157 Wn.2d at 24 (emphasis added). But when Zamora was transferred to Okanogan County Corrections Center, Skagit County provided only part of his file and no information on his mental health care needs, potentially curtailing Okanogan County’s ability to address those needs. CP at 2540, 2618. Under the majority’s reasoning, however, even the basic step of transferring Zamora’s file along with his person was categorically outside Skagit County’s § 319 duty. This cannot be a legitimate limit on Skagit County’s duty.</p>

However, this acknowledgment is inconsistent with the majority’s apparent conclusion that such actions do not include reasonably following up on available information and conveying that information to other responsible parties. Those are in fact <em>precisely </em>the type of actions that may be required to fulfill a § 319 duty because the ability to meaningfully control a foreseeably violent person necessarily requires adequate information about that person. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Joyce, </em>155 Wn.2d at 316-17 (“[A] jury could conclude that this duty was breached by the State’s failure to report egregious violations of the conditions of release to the court so that the <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>trial judge could take action appropriate to the offender’s conduct.”); <em>Taggart, </em>118 Wn.2d at 214 (parole officer allegedly failed to “provide his superior with relevant information necessary to enable the superior to make an informed decision whether to issue a parole warrant”).

This is unacceptable as applied to anyone, but is particularly disconcerting as applied to a presumptively innocent pretrial detainee who is known to be suffering from mental illness, as Zamora was for most of the time he was in Skagit County Jail.

CP at 2958, 3685, 3687. Zamora’s intermittent refusal to participate in mental health treatment cannot be treated as definitive proof that he would certainly have refused all treatment if, for instance, a medical professional had spoken to him as Skagit County Jail’s mental health counselor had requested. <em>Id. </em>at 3685. Moreover, the record indicates that after the shootings, Zamora was confined at Western State Hospital and took medications that did in fact control his psychotic symptoms. <em>Id. </em>at 2545.

However, in the specific context of a duty imposed by a special relationship, we have already held that “[t]he question of legal causation is so intertwined with the question of duty that the former can be answered by addressing the latter.” <em>Taggart, </em>118 Wn.2d at 226; <em>see also Hertog v.

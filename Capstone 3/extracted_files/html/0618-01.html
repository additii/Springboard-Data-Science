The State charged Thurlby with three counts of delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school bus route stop, all of which proceeded to jury trial. Thurlby was present when her trial began in December 2012. At the end of the first day, defense counsel instructed Thurlby to arrive in court a few minutes before 9:00 a.m. the following day. When court reconvened the following morning, Thurlby was absent. The trial court considered whether it should issue a bench warrant, but defense counsel advised that Thurlby did not have reliable transportation and requested a few additional minutes. The judge agreed to wait, but by 9:36 a.m. Thurlby was still absent. At that time, the trial court issued a bench warrant.</p>

The State advised that both the court rules and case law permitted the trial court to proceed with the trial without Thurlby present. The State, however, recommended that the court provide additional time for Thurlby to present herself and requested that the court recess until 1:30 p.m. Defense counsel objected to continuing without Thurlby but also noted that the court would have to wait until the afternoon at the earliest in order to satisfy the relevant case <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>law. The trial court agreed to recess until 1:30 p.m. so that it could properly determine whether Thurlby’s absence was voluntary.</p>

The State reported that law enforcement officers had contacted the local bail bond company and searched for Thurlby in several different locations but were unsuccessful in determining her location. Defense counsel also indicated that he had not received any communication from Thurlby. The trial court informed the parties that it had again reached out to the local hospital but was unable to locate Thurlby. The trial court had also contacted the court’s administration and the clerk’s office, but these sources once more reported that they had not received any communications from Thurlby.</p>

Defense counsel opposed the State’s motion and moved separately for a mistrial or a continuance. The trial court, making several findings, granted the State’s motion and denied the defense motion. First, the trial court made a preliminary finding that Thurlby was voluntarily absent because the trial court had not heard any good cause for her absence. The trial court additionally reasoned that Thurlby knew she was required to be in court but did not contact the court or defense counsel and did not ask to be excused. The court also recounted that it had contacted various sources but was still unable to locate Thurlby. Second, based on a number of findings, the trial court found that rescheduling the case would be difficult. The findings included the fact that several witnesses were not local, a special jailer had to be used to monitor a confidential informant within the courthouse, numerous witnesses had already testified, the State had already presented most of its evidence, and it was difficult to tell if Thurlby would ever return. Based on the inquiry into Thurlby’s whereabouts and the progress of the trial, the <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>trial court chose to proceed in Thurlby’s absence. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts at the conclusion of the second day of trial.</p>

Prior to sentencing, the trial court provided Thurlby with an opportunity to explain her nonattendance. Thurlby stated that she was absent because her mother underwent an unplanned surgery midway through trial. Thurlby claimed that she contacted the clerk’s office to reschedule but was informed that felony trials could not be rescheduled. She did not explain her mother’s circumstances to the recipient of the call. Thurlby’s mother also spoke to the trial court about her health problems. After hearing these statements, the trial court nevertheless made a finding that Thurlby was voluntarily absent. The trial court then sentenced Thurlby on three counts of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance and one count of bail jumping.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

It contacted the local hospital, the local jail, the court’s administration, and the clerk’s office to no avail. It inquired of both the State and the defense counsel whether they knew of Thurlby’s whereabouts. Similar to the court in <em>Thomson, </em>the trial court then waited over three hours for law enforcement to locate Thurlby or for Thurlby to contact the trial court or her attorney. Before making its ruling, the trial court again contacted the local hospital, the trial court’s administration, and the clerk’s office. It also confirmed with the parties that no one had heard from Thurlby.

Specifically, Thurlby argues that her mother’s unplanned surgery caused her to miss the conclusion of her trial. However, the trial court expressly addressed this claim. The trial court considered Thurlby’s statements and found that her decision to be with her mother was a product of choice. The trial court reasoned that Thurlby knew her appearance in court was mandatory but failed to contact her attorney or otherwise explain her absence at the time. Moreover, while her mother’s surgery was out of Thurlby’s control, the surgery itself did not prevent Thurlby from attending trial. The trial court acknowledged that Thurlby’s mother was in competent care and there was no representation that Thurlby was required to drive her mother to the hospital. While Thurlby’s choice was understandable, the trial court concluded that it was still a voluntary decision.

However, when the defendant did not appear by 9:25 a.m., the trial court determined that the defendant was voluntarily absent. <em><a href="/wash-app/184/0918-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="184 Wash.

However, as discussed above, at no point in <em>Garza </em>did we fault the trial court for failing to utter a certain phrase. Instead, we reversed because the trial court failed to truly indulge the presumption against waiver, as it waited only five minutes before finding that the defendant’s absence was voluntary. <em><a href="/wash-app/184/0918-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="184 Wash.

Importantly, we did not even reach the third prong in <em>Garza. </em>Both Thurlby and the court in <em>Cobarruvias </em>misinterpret how the presumption against waiver operates in the <em>Thomson </em>analysis. The presumption does not necessarily mean that, for the purposes of the third prong, the trial court begins its analysis with the presumption that the defendant has not waived his or her right to be present. This reading set forth by the court in <em>Cobarruvias </em>and advanced by Thurlby would essentially render the third prong a nullity. <em>Thomson </em>requires, and we now reaffirm, that in evaluating whether the defendant was voluntarily absent under the third prong, the trial court must consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the defendant’s failure to appear for trial. In evaluating the totality of the circumstances, the presumption operates by requiring the trial court to view the circumstances as explained by the defendant in a generous light, reading every reasonable inference <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>against waiver.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> This interpretation is consistent with our explanation in <em>Thomson, </em>where we noted that the third prong of the analysis “provides an opportunity for the defendant to explain his or her disappearance and <em>rebut </em>the finding of voluntary absence before the proceedings have been completed.” 123 Wn.2d at 883 (emphasis added). Thus, we hold that the trial court is not required to start its analysis anew in the third prong of the <em>Thomson </em>analysis.</p>

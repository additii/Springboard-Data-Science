Patricia Doss filed a claim for workers’ compensation with the Department of Labor and Industries (Department) after suffering chemical exposure during the course of employment with The Boeing Company. The exposure permanently aggravated her preexisting asthma, and she requires ongoing medical treatment as a result of these combined injuries.</p>

A right knee injury also contributed to Doss’s preexisting disability. Due to her permanent total disability, the Department awarded Doss a pension. Pursuant to RCW 51.16.120(1), the Department granted Boeing second injury fund relief, meaning that Boeing was not required to pay the entire cost of Doss’s pension, but only the portion attributable to the workplace exposure. The remaining portion of Doss’s pension was covered by the second injury fund, into which all employers <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>pay. The Department determined that Doss was also eligible for postpension medical treatment for her asthma under RCW 51.36.010(4). It directed Boeing to pay the cost of such treatment.</p>

A state fund employer’s experience rating is adjusted by an experience factor, which considers recent claims and losses, including medical costs. WAC 296-17--855, -850. A worker’s claim will affect an employer’s rating when it occurs during the “experience period,” which may vary between three to four years after the date of injury or occupational disease. <em>See </em>WAC 296-17-850(2), -855, -870. Medical costs incurred during this period will affect the experience factor of a state fund employer. Thus, post-pension medical costs authorized during this period affect the employer’s experience rating. But, any medical costs incurred after a final valuation of a claim do not affect the employer’s experience rating. So, these are instead charged to the medical aid fund, where the cost is spread to all state fund employers and workers. WAC 296-17-850(2), -855, -870.</p>

Postpension medical costs may be charged to the experience rating of state fund employers if the pension is granted before the three- to four-year valuation period. Even if the pension is granted after the final valuation period, the postpension medical cost is still charged to the medical aid fund, where the cost is spread among all state fund participants. This is not an option for Boeing. In deciding to forgo participation in the state fund, Boeing opted out of certain procedures but received the potential cost savings of administering its own claims. Self-insured employers are more aptly compared to the Department, in that they stand in the Department’s shoes in administering their own claims and paying workers’ compensation benefits directly.</p>

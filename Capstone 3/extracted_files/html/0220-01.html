The order involved in the present case embraced four carloads, and was dated May 15, 1920, the acceptance of appellee being- dated May» 18.

This car was received after the order of May 15, 1920, was given and accepted, and it was at that time that appellant undertook to cancel.the order on the ground that the shipments under a prior order were not up to the specifications of the contract.

Each order was separate, and constituted a distinct and independent contract, and, as before stated, the fact that some of the lumber shipped under the first order was not up to specifications affords no justification for the refusal to accept the lumber tendered under the last contract.</p>

Nor does the fact that all of the orders specify the same kind of lumber affect the question of appellant’s right to refuse performance of the contract on account of the lumber shipped on the former order being defective. Each order contained its own specifications of lumber to be shipped, and appellant undoubtedly bad the right to reject any lumber which was not in accordance with the specifications, but this is quite another thing from a refusal to permit performance of the last contract because there had been a breach in the performance of an independent contract.</p>

      <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>The argument, is that four carloads of lumber may mean any quantity that appellee might see fit to ship in four separate cars. It appears from the record that the capacity of railroad cars is from 8,000 to 15,000 feet of lumber. Under the terms of the contract, appellee had a right to deliver four carloads of at least minimum capacity, and the specification, we think, was not too indefinite to constitute an enforceable contract.</p>
    <p id="b247-5" data-blocks='[["BL_247.4",247,[155,810,1199,414]]]'>It is also contended that the contract was too indefinite because it did not specify the quantity of-lumber of the different grades. The effect of the contract is to bind the purchaser to accept carloads of lumber of any of the kinds specified without regard to the quantity of the different grades. In other words, the contract constituted an undertaking to accept lumber of any of the grades specified.</p>
    <p id="b247-6" data-blocks='[["BL_247.5",247,[157,1231,1199,515]]]'>Finally, it is contended that the verdict is not sustained by evidence sufficient to show the extent of the damage, but we are of the opinion that the evidence shows even more damages than the jury allowed. It is disclosed in the evidence that the parties corresponded for a time after appellant’s attempt to cancel the order, in an effort on the part of appellee to induce appellant to accept the lumber, and that the lumber was resold on the market within a reasonable time after appellant refused to accept it.</p>

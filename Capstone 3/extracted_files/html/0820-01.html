But the very next sentence of that statute says, “A declaration by the beneficiary made under the penalty of perjury stating that the beneficiary is the actual <em>holder </em>of the promissory note or other obligation secured by the deed of trust shall be sufficient proof as required under this subsection.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>

      <a id="p1178" href="#p1178" data-label="1178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1178</a>According to the testimony for the plaintiff, on the 23rd day of October, 1913, he secured a quitclaim deed to said land for the purpose of using’ it as color of title, so that he might secure title to the land by adverse possession. The plaintiff, Avery Masters, knew, and the grant- or in the quitclaim deed knew, that the latter had no title whatever to the land. They stated, however, that they did not think the land belonged to any one, and the plaintiff desired to acquire title to it by adverse possession. The land is on the east bank of White River in Wood-ruff County, Ark., and the original plat shows that it only contained about 15 acres. Additional land has been added to the tract by accretion, and it now comprises about 96 acres. The plaintiff lived on an adjoining tract of land at the time he secured the quitclaim deed in question, rand about five acres of the land involved in controversy was in his field, and he cultivated it. He after-wards had about ten acres additional cleared. He denied that he had occupied the land in question by permission from the widow of his brother, who claimed to own it, and said that he had tried to pay' taxes on the land since he had acquired a quitclaim deed to it, but that some one had always paid the taxes ahead of him.</p>

Her occupation of the land has been continuous ever since- that time, and her husband paid the taxes on the land until he died in 1896. After her husband’s death, she continued to occupy the land as her homestead, and to pay the taxes- thereon. In 1898 she married Wallace Haynes, and he came to live on the land with her. Prior to his death her husband built a new home on an adjoining tract of land and moved in it, but they continued to claim the- land in question as a part of their homestead. Their homestead had 65 acres of cleared land on it, and a part of the cleared land was on <a id="p1179" href="#p1179" data-label="1179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1179</a>the tract in controversy.

The decision of the chancery court was correct. According to the testimony of the plaintiff himself, about five acres of the land in controversy was in his field, and he was cultivating it at the time he obtained the quitclaim deed. He acquired the quitclaim deed for the very purpose of using it as color of title fo obtain title to the land by adverse possession. Before he could do this he should have relinquished his possession of the land and have again taken <a id="p1180" href="#p1180" data-label="1180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1180</a>possession of it under his quitclaim deed. Instead of doing this, he continued in possession of the five acres in the same way as before securing the quitclaim deed. According to the testimony of Mrs. Wallace Haynes, he was holding this possession'by permission from her. All the attendant circumstances corroborate her' testimony. Wesley Masters, the brother of Avery Masters, lived on the land from 1884 up to a short time before his death in 1896. He cultivated the cleared land, and paid taxes on all of it. Then he built a new house on an adjoining tract, but continued to cultivate the cleared land, and to pay the taxes on all of it. After his death his widow continued to cultivate the cleared land, and to claim all of it as a part of her homestead. She also continued to pay the taxes on the 'whole tract.</p>
    <p id="b1200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1200.5",1200,[296,1214,1203,649]]]'>It is true that she first testified that M. A. Harris had conveyed the. land in question to her husband, and afterwards a deed was found on record which showed that Harris had conveyed to Wesley Masters an adjoining tract of land. The evidence, however, shows that Harris did not own the adjoining tract of land, and it is fairly inferable that he intended to convey to Wesley Masters the tract, of land in question, and by mistake described an adjoining tract. This is shown by the fact that Harris lived on the tract in question at the time he executed .the deed to Wesley Masters, and that he moved off of the land when he executed the deed, and Wesley Masters moved into the house which Harris had vacated.</p>

The reason is that .he had no title whatever to the land, and is in no wise interested in it. Under the evidence presented in the record, M.. A. Harris intended to convey the land in controversy to Wesley Masters, and 'by mistake conveyed Another tract. An equitable estate in the <a id="p1181" href="#p1181" data-label="1181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1181</a>land, however, passed to Wesley Masters, who died intestate.

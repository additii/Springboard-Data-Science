Roman Fedorov was arrested for attempting to elude law enforcement and driving under the influence. He was transported to the Fife City Jail for the purpose of administering a breath alcohol concentration (BAC) test. Fedorov asked for, and was granted, the opportunity to speak with an on-call defense attorney by telephone before consenting to take the BAC test, pursuant to CrR 3.1. The Washington State Patrol (WSP) trooper, however, remained in the one-room Fife jail, citing safety concerns and his need to perform a 15-minute observation period before administering the BAC test. The trooper stood out of earshot at the far side of the room. Fedorov and his attorney chose to converse only in yes/no questions, fearing Fedorov would blurt out something incriminating. Fedorov argues that the presence of the trooper in the room violated his rule-based right to counsel because only with absolute privacy can the right to counsel be effective.</p>

Durbin pursued; the car accelerated to 130 mph, avoiding traffic by driving on the far right shoulder and then suddenly exiting 1-5, running several red lights. The car, now traveling the wrong way down Pacific Avenue, turned off its lights and drove into a parking lot. Trooper Durbin cornered the car and directed the occupants to exit. A passenger quickly exited the vehicle. The driver, Fedorov, exited slowly, resisting Trooper Durbin’s directions to lie flat on the ground. Durbin observed in Fedorov signs of intoxication, including bloodshot eyes and poor coordination. He arrested Fedorov, read him his <em>Miranda</em>

The building is basically one large windowless room, variously described in the récord as being 29 feet by 17 feet or “29 paces” by “17 paces,” entered via a sally port. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Vols. 1 &amp; 2) at 22. Testimony at trial stated that officers who brought individuals to the jail for BAC testing were personally responsible for their arrestees. Entering and exiting the jail is difficult <a id="p673" href="#p673" data-label="673" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*673</a>because only one officer has the key to the sally port. A telephone is located at one end of the room, along with a metal loop so that arrestees can be handcuffed to that location. At the other end of the room is a washing machine and clothing for those incarcerated.</p>
    <p id="b727-4" data-blocks='[["BL_727.4",727,[121,627,1256,422]]]'>¶5 Trooper Durbin asked Fedorov to take a BAC test. He read the implied consent warnings and asked a series of preliminary questions. He also began the statutorily required 15-minute pretest observation period before administering the test. After answering these questions, Fedorov asked to speak to an attorney. Trooper Durbin arranged for Fedorov to speak to a public defender, Nicholas Andrews, by telephone.</p>
    <p id="b727-5" data-blocks='[["BL_727.5",727,[120,1073,1250,427]]]'>¶6 Andrews began by asking Trooper Durbin some preliminary questions about Fedorov. He then asked for complete privacy. Durbin responded that because he could not observe Fedorov from outside the jail, he could not provide Fedorov with complete privacy. Durbin testified that when an arrestee asks for privacy, he would walk to the other side of the room near the washing machine to give as much privacy as he could while keeping the arrestee in view.</p>

Durbin also testified that he would not have been able to hear Fedorov’s conversation at the far side of the room unless Fedorov spoke loudly. Andrews asked Fedorov a series of yes/no questions but testified later at the suppression hearing that the yes/no format made asking certain questions unfeasible given the allotted time. Andrews did, however, inform Fedorov of his rights and the consequences of refusing the BAC test. He did not make a recommendation to Fedorov whether to take the test. This telephone call between Andrews and Fedorov lasted approximately 13 minutes; the record does not show that Trooper Durbin interrupted or interfered in any way. Durbin testified that he stood by the washing machine at the other end of the room, filling out paperwork during the <a id="p674" href="#p674" data-label="674" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*674</a>telephone call.

    <p id="b728-4" data-blocks='[["BL_728.4",728,[190,458,1248,434]]]'>¶8 Fedorov moved to suppress the BAC test results. He argued that Trooper Durbin’s presence denied him his right to converse privately with counsel. The trial judge agreed that there was insufficient privacy afforded to Fedorov, but concluded that he suffered no prejudice because he was still able to freely converse with Andrews and he decided to take the BAC test anyway. Fedorov’s motion to suppress was denied, and he was later convicted by jury trial. He appealed.</p>
    <p id="b728-5" data-blocks='[["BL_728.5",728,[191,911,1253,1028]]]'>¶9 Although Fedorov did not assign error to any of the trial court’s findings, the State challenged “Findings as to Disputed Facts No. 1” because this “finding” contained an imbedded conclusion of law that “there was insufficient privacy afforded to the defendant during his phone call with Mr. Andrews.” Clerk’s Papers at 117. All other findings are verities on appeal. The Court of Appeals affirmed, but on different grounds. <em>State v.

Rather, because the rule-based right to counsel at this stage is limited, whether the right was violated depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Concluding that there was no violation of the rule-based right to counsel, the Court of Appeals did not address the issue of prejudice.</p>

Defendant Hanson spoke to counsel with the arresting officer 5 to 10 feet away, separated by a brick wall with an open window. The officer testified that he could hear Hanson speaking but could not make out any of her words. Defendant Koch was placed in a room approximately 30 feet wide by 50 feet long. The arresting officer remained in the room approximately 10 to 15 feet away. The officer also testified that he could hear Koch speak but could not make out any words unless Koch spoke loudly. Koch’s counsel, like Fedorov’s, chose to ask only yes/no questions. <em>Koch, </em><a href="/wash-app/53/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="53 Wash.

Although we emphasize that police should provide as much privacy as possible during such consultations, that privacy is balanced against legitimate safety and practical concerns. When analyzing alleged violations, a reviewing court looks to a number of factors and makes a case-by-case determination under the totality of the circumstances. There is no exclusive list, but these factors include concerns for the safety of police, prevention of harm to police property, the need to comply with testing protocols, and the physical setting where the events take place. Of special concern may be the safety of the arrestee: arrestees can pose dangers to themselves, be in danger from substances they may have taken, or have pressing medical conditions both related and unrelated to the crime of arrest. And if police afford lesser privacy to an arrestee, evidence of intentional intimidation or eavesdropping by police meant to undermine the arrestee’s rule-based right to consultation would weigh toward finding a violation of CrR 3.1.</p>

Trooper Durbin had legitimate reasons for remaining in the room during Fedorov’s telephone conversation with counsel: Fedorov was uncooperative at the time of arrest, and therefore Trooper Durbin had legitimate concerns about leaving Fedorov alone. The layout of the Fife jail only increased these concerns because giving Fedorov complete privacy would have required Trooper Durbin to lock himself out of the jail and away from his arrestee. Trooper Durbin was also required by statute to observe Fedorov for 15 minutes prior to administering the BAC test, something he could not have done if he were outside the windowless jail. Trooper Durbin also afforded Fedorov sufficient privacy by moving to the other side of the room, out of earshot, and the record contains no evidence that Durbin interfered, or even so much as paid attention to, Fedorov’s conversation.

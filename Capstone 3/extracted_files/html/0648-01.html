The GMA requires counties to ensure an adequate water supply before granting a building permit or subdivision application. The County merely follows the Department of Ecology’s “Nook-sack Rule”;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> it assumes there is an adequate supply to provide water for a permit-exempt well unless Ecology has expressly closed that area to permit-exempt appropriations. This results in the County’s granting building permits for houses and subdivisions to be supplied by a permit-exempt well even if the cumulative effect of exempt wells in a watershed reduces the flow in a water course below the minimum instream flow. We therefore hold that the County’s comprehensive plan does not satisfy the GMA requirement to protect water availability and that its remaining arguments are unavailing. We reverse the Court of Appeals in part and remand to the Board for further proceedings.</p>

The Nooksack Rule establishes minimum instream flows for WRIA 1, covering most of the County. However, the County argues—and Ecology agrees—that the closures and minimum flow requirements established by the rule are not applicable to permit-exempt wells in the County. Thus, the County argues that its comprehensive plan complies with the GMA requirements because water is presumptively available in the County for permit-exempt wells.

It assumes this provision of the building code requires Whatcom County to determine water right priorities before it may grant a building permit that relies on a permit-exempt well. It also assumes this provision prohibits the county from relying on the Department of Ecology’s determination of whether water is available for withdrawal in a particular basin. The effect of the majority’s holding is to require individual building permit applicants to commission a hydrogeological study to show that their very small withdrawal does not impair senior water rights, and then have the local building department evaluate the adequacy of that scientific data. The practical result of this holding is to stop counties from granting building permits that rely on permit-exempt wells. Not only is this contrary to the clear legislative purpose of RCW 19.27.097, it potentially puts counties at odds with the Department of Ecology and imposes impossible burdens on landowners.

In GMA regulations, the term “adequate” refers to actual water supply, not legal availability. <em>See </em>WAC 365-196-210(3) (Department of Commerce GMA regulations defining “adequate public facilities” as “facilities which have the capacity to serve development without decreasing levels of service below locally established minimums”), -410(1)(d) (“The housing element must contain at least the following features:...

Boards of Equalization : Act providing * for, const ituI.</a> The validity of the act of the Legislature which authorizes the appointment of the board is assailed. The argument is that the Constitution directs the election of one Assessor by the electors of each county, while the act in question attempts to authorize the Governor to appoint three persons whose duties, as prescribed bv it, are such as the framers of the Constitution contemplated should be performed by the Assessor, and thus undertakes to establish an agency for ascertaining the value of property for taxation in violation of the Constitution,</p>

    <p id="b530-9" data-blocks='[["BL_530.8",530,[374,1436,1207,548]]]'>The governing idea of this provision is that the burden of taxation shall be equally and uniformly laid upon property in proportion to its value. As a means to the attainment of this end, assessments for taxation should be made by the same standard and as near the actual value of the property assessed as possible. It is a violation of the mandate .contained in this provision to return any property for assessment at less than its value. If the law is enforced, every person will contribute to the public revenue in proportion to the value of the property owned by him.</p>

There is no showing that the action of the board has worked injustice to any one. The argument is simply that the return of the County Assessor is a finality and concludes all further inquiry as to valuation, <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>notwithstanding his return may state the value of the property of a particular individual at only a half, or it may be a hundredth part of its true value, when all other property is fairly assessed.</p>

No degree of care and diligence on the part of the most competent Assessor can attain perfect equality, or perhaps prevent striking mistakes and oversights in assessments. A near approximation to correctness is the most that can be expected. The difficulty of preserving a just relation between the different parts of the same county, or even the several wards of a city, is enhanced by the necessity of delegating the power of fixing values to the different individuals who act as assistant or deputy Assessors. Experience had taught and the framers of the Constitution must have known, that in a populous and wealthy county like Pulaski, the Assessor, unaided, could not perform the duties of his office so as to approximate uniformity and' equality; and the Legislature, recognizing the necessity, have continued the practice that prevailed prior to the adoption of the present Constitution, of providing assistant Assessors to aid in the work. Their returns of the valuation of the same class of property may be widely divergent. The necessity of the case, in view of the irpmense labor to be performed, commonly forces the Assessor to take their returns as correct. If the Legislature is powerless to undertake the correction of these discrepancies and the <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>obvious errors that creep into the system, then the most important security that has been devised for the benefit of the tax payer may be rendered useless. An under-assessment for taxation, whether, arising from an honest intention and belief on the part of the Assessor,-or from a concealment or misrepresentation of facts by the tax payer, is an injury to the public. The burden of every other' tax payer is increased to make up the deficit. An over-valuation is an oppression to the individual. Both are violations of the constitutional provision above quoted; and if the Legislature is restrained, as is contended, from .exercising the power of properly adjusting the burden between the tax payers, the provision containing the inhibition must be very plainly irreconcilable with the right to exercise that power.</p>

Dig., sec. 5693. </em>A change of procedure is not made manifest when they meet to equalize the assessment of personal property. For then the Assessor is required' to attend the meetings of the board and explain his assessments of personalty if the board requires it, and it is made the duty of the members of the board to “carefully examine the county records” in making their investigations for the purposes of equalizing their assessments. This duty of investigation enjoined upon the board extends to the records of all the public officers of the county which contain anything to throw light upon their labors. It embraces the records of hens and mortgages in the recorder’s office and the judgment records of the courts which show credits liable to assessment, as well as the Assessor’s roll of personal assessments. The duty to examine these is not coupled in the statute with the hearing of a complaint. Why should the board pursue these sources of information, why make an investigation for the purpose of equalization, if they must wait for a complaint, and for evidence to be adduced, and be confined to the issues made by the parties complaining? It is easy to perceive who will be likely to complain when an assessment is too high, but from whom shall the complaint come when it is too low ? It is not <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>probable that the owner will complain, and it is not made the duty of any one else to do so.

On the contrary the amendment of 1887, supra, clearly implies that notice is not required until the board has completed its labors, when a hearing is afforded to those who desire it, in the County Court.

    <p id="b537-3" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[176,447,1203,562]]]'>The appellant then filed answer, in which it denied all the allegations of the complaint, and alleged in its answer that it issued the group policy and certificate, and that appellee was insured under the group policy. It also alleged that the group policy provided that installments were payable only from three months after the receipt of proof of total and permanent disability, and that appellee was seeking to recover from the date of the injury rather than for the benefits which had accrued from three months after the date of proof. The group policy was introduced in evidence by agreement.</p>
    <p id="b537-4" data-blocks='[["BL_537.5",537,[179,1032,1202,561]]]'>The appellee, W. L. Gregory, testified that he became totally and permanently disabled prior to his 60th birthday. Appellee’s application and other written instrur ments were introduced, which showed that he was a year older than he claimed. The application card showed that he was born August 28,1870, instead of 1,871, but his age was written in the application as 55. Lines were drawn through the 55, and 56 was inserted. Appellee testified that this was done after he signed the application, and without his knowledge or consent; that he knew nothing about it.</p>

It first contends that the evidence is not sufficient to support the verdict of the jury, and that the verdict is contrary to law and evidence. The evidence is ample to show that appellee’s disability began on January 25, 1931, and, if appellee was 55 when the policy was issued, this disability, if it began on January 25, 1931, would be before he reached the age of 60 years. It is, however, earnestly insisted that, because the written application showed that appellee’s birth was August 28, 1870, and because the report of the physician and letter written by appellee’s attorney show that he was more than 60 years of age at the time of the injury, the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict. In other words, it is contended that the written statements made by appel<a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>lee, and others representing- him show that he was more than 60 years of .ago at the time he claims to have been injured.</p>

    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[273,776,1215,301]]]'>The rule is well established that it is the province of the jury, and not the court, to pass upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony. A verdict of a jury, based on substantial evidence, must be upheld by this court, although we might think it -was contrary to the preponderance of the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.6",538,[285,1100,1200,400]]]'>Appellant, however, says that, while it recognizes the rule and the precedents, it is still of opinion that this court has not adopted the scintilla of evidence rule. This court has not adopted the scintilla of evidence rule, but it has adopted the rule that, if there is any substantial evidence to support the verdict, it will be permitted to stand, although it might appear to us to be against the preponderance of the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b538-6" data-blocks='[["BL_538.7",538,[284,1525,1200,350]]]'>The appellee testified positively as to his age, and testified that the figures 55, showing his age, were in the application when he signed it, and that lines had been drawn through the figures 55, and 56 had been inserted. The application itself shows that this had been done, and appellee testifies that it was done after he signed, the application.</p>
    <p id="b538-7" data-blocks='[["BL_538.8",538,[280,1900,1202,495]]]'>It is true that in the application the date of his birth was given as 1870. He testifies that this was a mistake, and that it should have been 1871. Nobody disputes this, and the only contradiction of this evidence is other written statements signed by appellee. He could have been mistaken if he gave the date of his birth as 1870. At any rate, this was a question of fact for the jury to determine. It cannot be said that the positive- testimony of the appellee and the explanations given by him are not substantial evidence.</p>

It is not only their privilege, but their right, to judge of the sufficiency of the evidence introduced, to establish any one or more facts in the case on trial. The credibility of the witnesses, the strength of their testimony, its tendency, and the proper weight to be given it, are matters peculiarly within their province. The law has constituted them the proper tribunal for the determination of such questions. To take from them this right is but usurping a power not given. * * When there is a total defect of evidence as to any essential fact, or a spark, a ‘scintilla,’ as it is termed, the case should be withdrawn from the consideration of the jury.” <em>Cunningham v.

Over the next 20 years, this partnership and its successors built the Deer Meadows Golf Course Complex (including a golf course, restaurant, hotel, store, and club), platted several nearby parcels of property into subdivisions (the Deer Meadows and Deer Heights subdivisions), and sold lots to private land owners for homes and vacation properties. A plat identifying the golf course was recorded, and an image of the plat was used to help advertise the development. A local newspaper quoted Spencer as saying he built the golf course complex “ ‘so it would help sell the residential lots around here,’ ” and the lots were advertised accordingly. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 107. Over the next 20 years, ownership of the unsold lots and the golf course changed forms and hands several times. After Spencer passed away and after most of the lots were sold, Livingston closed down the golf course complex and began the process of platting the course into new residential lots.</p>

Some of those homeowners formed the Riverview Community Group, which filed this lawsuit seeking to bar the defendants from selling off the former golf course as individual homes, among other things. Riverview argued that the golf course complex was the heart of the community and provided necessary amenities and that its members had bought their property reasonably believing it would remain a part of their development. Riverview named as defendants the original Spencer &amp; Livingston partnership, George and Sheila Livingston, the partnership’s alleged successors, and anyone else claiming an interest in the golf course property. Riverview sought to impose an equitable servitude on the golf course property that would limit its use to a golf course or, if that was untenable, for other equitable relief. It also sought injunctive relief.</p>

CR 17(a) provides that “[e]very action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.” Given that we find organizational standing, this rule has been satisfied. Nor have the respondents otherwise established that the individual property owners in the subdivisions were indispensable parties under CR 19(a), and we agree with the Court of Appeals that the trial court was incorrect in concluding otherwise. The Livingstons argue that the individual landowners in the developments are necessary parties because they could individually bring suit, raising the possibility of inconsistent results. Among other things, a party is indispensable when it “is needed for just adjudication.” <em>Gildon, </em>158 Wn.2d at 494 (citing <em>Crosby v.

Given that Riverview is seeking only equitable and injunctive relief, the other homeowners are not needed for a just adjunction. If it succeeds, the other property owners will be benefited. <em>See Auto. United Trades Org. v. State, </em><a href="/wash-2d/175/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="175 Wash. 2d 214" data-case-ids="4024285" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/175/0214-01">175 Wn.2d 214</a>, 225, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20P.3d%2052" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="285 P.3d 52">285 P.3d 52</a> (2012) (noting that an absent party’s ability to protect its interest is not impaired if that interest is adequately protected by existing parties). If Riverview’s suit ultimately fails, we discern no necessary injury to the property owners who have not joined the cause. While we need not reach the second step, if we do, equity and good conscience do not cry out for dismissal, especially given that the Livingstons have not established that the Court of <a id="p896" href="#p896" data-label="896" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*896</a>Appeals was incorrect that the various statutes of limitations on potential claims has or will soon run.</p>

Here, we essentially have a plaintiff who is acting as if it is the named class plaintiff for an unnamed group of representative plaintiffs without complying with CR 23. By not clearly admonishing this circumvention of basic court rules and forcing the plaintiffs to bring this meritorious suit in the proper way, the majority opens the door for groups of individuals with similar claims against a group of people to simply form a nonprofit to sue on their behalf, thereby avoiding the stringent class action requirements or the spotlight of individual litigation. Under the facts of this case, the property owners may bring either a class action lawsuit or they may join together as individuals like the plaintiffs in <em>Johnson v. Mt. Baker Park Presbyterian Church, </em><a href="/wash/113/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="113 Wash. 458" data-case-ids="704318" data-case-paths="/wash/113/0458-01">113 Wash. 458</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20P.%20536" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="194 P. 536">194 P. 536</a> (1920), and <em>Hollis v.

Suing is not germane to the purposes of Riverview. It is the entire reason for its formation and existence. It is all the entity was formed to do. However, courts have generally interpreted this element of organizational standing liberally and since we find that Riverview fails to meet the third part of the test, we need not discuss this further.</p>

Further, Oregon had a specific statute that allowed the homeowners association to bring the suit in its own name. <em><a href="/or-app/228/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="228 Or.

Thus, <em>Mountain High Homeowners Ass’n </em>does not support finding standing for a nonprofit entity created after all relevant events to sue to imply an equitable servitude. Additionally, Riverview refers the court to both <em>Shalimar Ass’n v. D.O.C.

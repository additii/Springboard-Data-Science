Respondents Ross and Cindy Wilkinson et al. asked the trial court to invalidate a 2011 amendment to the community covenants prohibiting rental of their homes for less than 30 days. We must decide if short-term vacation rentals conflict with the covenants in place prior to 2011, if the Association validly amended the covenants to prohibit them, and if the trial court erred by striking portions of the offered evidence. We hold short-term rentals do not violate the covenants barring commercial use of the property or restricting lots to single-family residential use. We also hold the Association exceeded its power to amend the covenants when it prohibited short-term vacation rentals in 2011 and the trial court did not err by granting in part motions brought by the Wilkinsons to strike evidence.

From this it is evident that had the drafters wanted to prohibit rentals of a particular duration, they would have done so. The 1988/1992 covenants specify the rights and duties of Chiwawa residents in painstaking detail, spelling out, inter alia, the animals residents may keep, the minimum distance houses must be set back from the front lot line, the size of name signs residents may display, and their authority to bring enforcement actions. <em>See </em>CP at 81-82, 85-86. Most apparently, the drafters specifically anticipated and permitted rentals when they restricted the size of rental signs residents could hang. CP at 82, 86.

Read in context, the single-family covenant restricts only the type and appearance of buildings that may be constructed on the lot, not who may reside there.

While it is true that when determining whether an amendment is consistent with the general plan of development we look to the language of the covenants, their apparent import, and the surrounding facts, the dissent misapprehends the inquiry at issue in <em>Meresse. </em>Unlike the covenants in <em>Shafer, </em>the covenants in <em>Meresse </em>did not allow a majority to create new covenants but only to change existing ones. <a href="/wash-app/100/0857-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="100 Wash.

Thus, for the amendment in <em>Meresse </em>to be valid, it had to be both consistent with the general plan of development and related to an existing covenant. Accordingly, the homeowners argued that the amendment regarding the relocation of an access road was not a new wholesale restriction but rather a change to the preexisting “ ‘road maintenance’ ” covenant regarding road “ ‘construction’ ” and “ ‘repair.’ ” <em><a href="/wash-app/100/0857-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="100 Wash.

Individuals on vacation are not limited by constraints of the same kind as other renters. It seems odd to ignore the fact that many people equate vacations with freedom to act in ways outside their normal conduct. It is to be expected that spirits may be higher and conduct more uninhibited. Noise levels, for example, could well be higher as a consequence. Vacationers might not be as considerate of neighbors and their neighbors’ peace and quiet as if they were residents on a more permanent basis. It cannot be gainsaid that some on vacation consume alcoholic beverages to a greater degree than they ordinarily would, with consequent effects on their behavior. I do not doubt that many of these behaviors occur with residents as well as vacationers, but it seems to be to be putting blinders on to conclude that there is no meaningful distinction relevant to the commercial versus residential uses distinction. Certainly, in any given case, the vacationer may behave in every significant respect like a resident.

The <em>Ross </em>court held only that a particular restrictive covenant limiting property use to “residence purposes only” was consistent with short-term vacation rentals. And it based that holding on a highly fact-specific record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_7" id="ref_footnote_3_7">14</a> That record contained a declaration by one of the covenant’s drafters showing that the drafters had “ ‘modeled’ ” the disputed covenants on those from a neighboring community where “ ‘vacation rentals’ ” did occur. <em>Ross, </em><a href="/wash-app/148/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="148 Wash.

It was whether the Association could validly limit short-term rentals pursuant to the Pope &amp; Talbot and 1988/1992 restrictive covenants, which prohibited nuisances and offensive uses, banned commercial and nonresidential uses, permitted limited rental signage, restricted lots to “single family” use, and reserved to the Association the power to adopt new land-use restrictions by majority vote. CP at 13, 30. These covenants clearly permit some rental activity, because they allow residents to post signs advertising their properties for rent. They also clearly contemplate restrictions on rental <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>advertising, because they limit rental signage to one sign per lot. For the most part, however, these covenants raise questions: what constitutes a nuisance; what constitutes an offensive use; when rentals might conflict with single-family residential usage; and whether there are any specific limits on the majority’s power to amend the covenants.</p>

Rather, the court must consider the disputed covenants in their entirety, along with any extrinsic evidence relevant to their interpretation. The majority refuses to acknowledge the admissibility of any extrinsic evidence at all in this case, because it concludes (apparently as a matter of law) that the drafters of the original and 1988/1992 Chiwawa River Pines covenants “anticipated rentals and <em>consciously </em>decided not to limit their duration.” Majority at 251 (emphasis added).

The majority makes the same error. This deprives the parties of an opportunity to present evidence on how to interpret the original covenants and how to determine the homeowners’ reasonable expectations about how those covenants might be amended. This also substitutes the values of this court’s majority for the values of the drafters and homeowners. Instead, I would remand for a proper factual inquiry. I therefore dissent.</p>

First, as the majority concedes, the Association assigned error to the trial court’s <em>entire </em>summary judgment order. <em>See </em>majority at 245 n.1 (citing Br. of Appellant at 3-4). Having done so, the Association will surely be surprised to learn that the majority has decided not to address every issue in that order. As noted above, the trial court’s summary judgment order stated that “to the extent that the 2011 Amendment... seeks to bar residential rentals of <em>any duration, </em>including those of less than 30 days, it is unenforceable.” CP at 443 (emphasis added). Clearly, the Association hoped that this court would recognize its authority to ban rentals of 30 days. I see no indication that it wanted this court, in the event that we upheld the trial court’s ruling on the 30-day rental ban, to quietly leave in place the <em>rest </em>of the trial court’s order banning rental limits of “any duration.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=759%20P.2d%20427" class="citation" data-index="142" data-cite="759 P.2d 427">Id.</a> </em>Certainly, RAP 12.1(a) is not a license to do so.</p>

The effect of this reasoning is a blanket prohibition on any amendments to the Chiwawa River Pines covenants that limit rental activity <em>by duration. </em>The majority leaves open the possibility that vacation rental activity may be limited in Chiwawa River Pines in other ways — perhaps by a ban on the provision of room service because that is too “commercial” under <em>Mains Farm Homeowners Ass’n v. Worthington, </em><a href="/wash-2d/121/0810-01" class="citation" data-index="143" data-cite="121 Wash. 2d 810" data-case-ids="1365815" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/121/0810-01">121 Wn.2d 810</a>, 816, <a href="/citations/?q=854%20P.2d%201072" class="citation" data-index="144" data-cite="854 P.2d 1072">854 P.2d 1072</a> (1993) — but it absolutely prohibits any purely durational limit.</p>

According to the majority, if that use is “ ‘eating, sleeping, and other residential purposes,’ ” it is permitted “ ‘no matter how short the rental duration.’ ” Majority at 252 (quoting Ross <em>v.

Clemmons contacted Eddie Lee Davis and Letrecia Nelson shortly after the murders, and based on their actions following that contact, Davis and Nelson were convicted of rendering criminal assistance and possession of a stolen firearm. Davis was also convicted of unlawful possession of that firearm. This opinion, which has four votes, would hold that the State presented sufficient evidence to support the firearm possession convictions. However, that is not the opinion of the majority. On the second issue, the court, with eight votes, finds that the trial court’s imposition of an exceptional sentence as to Davis’s and Nelson’s convictions for rendering criminal assistance is not legally justified. Thus, the result of the three opinions of the court is to reverse the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</p>

There was no testimony that Clemmons made any specific requests or orders as to what should be done with the stolen gun while he was at Nelson’s home, and he did not even know where the gun was until he was ready to leave about 15 minutes later. It is reasonable to infer that someone else decided what to do with the gun and that the decision-makers were Nelson and Davis because Nelson retrieved the shopping bag and put the gun inside it and Davis immediately responded when Clemmons asked where the gun was. Furthermore, both Nelson and Davis retained the ability to take further actions as to the gun until the time Davis gave it back to Clemmons because they knew where it was and Clemmons did not.

This statute authorizes the imposition of an exceptional sentence for an offense that “involved a destructive and foreseeable impact on persons other than the victim.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=28%20P.3d%20780" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="28 P.3d 780">Id.</a> </em>RCW 9.94A.535(3) provides an exclusive list of aggravators that the jury may find, including the destructive impact aggravator. The application of this specific aggravator partially depends on whether rendering criminal assistance victimizes the general public and whether particularized harm suffered by identifiable individuals can justify the aggravator as applied to rendering. The lead opinion reasons that because rendering criminal assistance victimizes the general public, which includes everyone, the destructive impact aggravator can never apply to rendering convictions because no one is “ ‘other than’ ” everyone. Lead opinion at 231 (emphasis omitted) (quoting RCW 9.94A.535(3)(r)). I would find that context requires the word “victim” in the aggravator statute to mean something different from the general definition in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), as codified in RCW 9.94A.030.</p>

RCW 9.94A.030(53) defines a “victim” as “any person who has sustained emotional, psychological, physical, or financial injury ... as a direct result of the crime charged.” In <em>Sweat </em>we held that context may require using a broader meaning for the word “victim” than the general term provided in RCW 9.94A.030(53). <em>Id. </em>at 160. Such is the case here. The lead opinion places too much weight on the fact that rendering criminal assistance arises from actions that are not “intended to cause or actually causing direct injury to any person.” Lead opinion at 230 (footnote omitted). This does not make rendering criminal assistance unique. We have recognized that the general public is a victim of every crime. <em>State v. Haddock, </em><a href="/wash-2d/141/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="141 Wash. 2d 103" data-case-ids="1183477" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/141/0103-01">141 Wn.2d 103</a>, 111, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20P.3d%20733" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="3 P.3d 733">3 P.3d 733</a> (2000); lead opinion at 230-31. Because a broad definition of “victim” under this aggravator would include everyone, the legislature could not have intended for that broad definition of “victim” to control. Otherwise, the aggravator would never apply.</p>

Instead, we should read the phrase “persons other than the victim” as meaning those who suffer particularized harm from crimes that victimize the general public. RCW 9.94A.535(3)(r). The Court of Appeals held that while rendering criminal assistance does victimize the general public, the aggravator still applies where “the evidence demonstrates a destructive and foreseeable impact on a <em>specific </em>individual or entity.” <em>Davis, </em><a href="/wash-app/176/0849-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="176 Wash.

The court rejected the proposition that rendering victimizes <em>only </em>the general public based on the definitions of “victim” in the SRA and “person” in the dictionary. The court determined that the word “person” indicates a linguistic distinction between individuals and the mass of society. <em><a href="/wash-app/176/0849-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="176 Wash.

Under the definitions of both “victim” and “person,” application of the aggravator is appropriate when there is a distinct destructive impact on persons other than society as a whole. At trial, the State <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>offered evidence that the families of the involved police officers suffered intense fear that Clemmons would target them next. Because the jury could identify the individual family members and the destructive impact they felt, the aggravator applies.</p>

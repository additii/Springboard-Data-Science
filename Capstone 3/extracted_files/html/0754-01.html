Jeanne Lewis purchased a condominium with a $277,000 loan from Bank of America. The condominium association recorded its declaration in 2006. Bank of America recorded its deed of trust in 2007. Lewis defaulted on her condominium assessments in 2008. In 2009, the condominium association initiated a judicial foreclosure proceeding under chapter 64.34 RCW. Michael Fulbright bought the condominium at the trustee’s sale for less than $15,000, which under the statute would extinguish Bank of America’s lien. Bank of America attempted to redeem the condominium under the redemption statute, RCW 6.23.010. Because Bank of America recorded its deed of trust before Lewis defaulted on her assessments, the trial <a id="p757" href="#p757" data-label="757" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*757</a>court and Court of Appeals held that Bank of America did not record its mortgage “subsequent in time” to the condominium’s lien and therefore under RCW 6.23.010, Bank of America did not have a statutory right of redemption.

At the time, under the redemption statute, the right to redemption applied to creditors having a lien “subsequent in time” to the foreclosing lien. Fulbright objected, claiming that Bank of America was not a qualified redemptioner because its deed of trust was recorded before Lewis defaulted on her assessments and the Association brought this action. On May 6, 2011, before the one-year redemption period expired, Bank of America tendered the estimated redemption amount and brought this action against Fulbright, seeking a declaratory judgment that Bank of America was an authorized redemptioner under Washington law.

This rule was universally clarified, and now every state has some form of statutory recording system. The purpose and effect of a recording act is to reverse the order of priorities in certain cases. 18 William B. Stoebuck &amp; John W. Weaver, Washington Practice: Real Estate: Transactions § 14.5, at 126-29 (2d ed. 2004). Washington has a “race-notice” type of recording system, which was enacted initially in 1854. <em>See </em>Laws of 1854, § 4, at 403. Now codified under RCW 65.08.070, the recording act provides that the deed or interest first recorded is superior to any outstanding unrecorded conveyance of the same property unless the later mortgagee or purchaser had actual knowledge of the prior unrecorded interest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Suppose Bank A obtained a lien — i.e., executed, acknowledged, and delivered a loan — on day one. Bank B obtained a lien on the same property on day two. Without any other action, Bank B’s lien is subsequent in time and subsequent in priority to Bank A’s lien. This is consistent with the common law theory of liens, “first in time, first in right.” After enactment of the recording act, whichever bank records first will have priority. In other words, if Bank A records its lien on day three and Bank B records its lien on day four, Bank A will <a id="p760" href="#p760" data-label="760" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*760</a>have priority because it obtained its lien first temporally and, more importantly, because it recorded first. Changing the facts, if on day three Bank B recorded its lien without knowledge of Bank A’s lien and Bank A did not record its lien until day four, Bank B would have priority over Bank A. “Time” therefore, under the recording act, centers generally on the recording date, which, as the example illustrates, could result in the reordering of priorities.</p>

Laws of 1899, ch. 53, § 7, at 89. Priority of interests were decided by date of recording pursuant to the recording statute and not by the date the interest was created. Before the legislature amended the redemption statute in 2013, real property could be redeemed by “[a] creditor having a lien by judgment, decree, deed of trust, or mortgage, on any portion of the property, or any portion of any part thereof, separately sold, <em>subsequent in time </em>to that on which the property was sold.” Former RCW 6.23-.010(1)(b) (1987) (emphasis added).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Since 1899, the Washington legislature has revised the redemption statute only twice. In 1987, the legislature codified our holding in <em>Rustad Heating &amp; Plumbing Co. v. Waldt, </em><a href="/wash-2d/91/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="91 Wash. 2d 372" data-case-ids="1101784" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/91/0372-01">91 Wn.2d 372</a>, 376, <a href="/citations/?q=588%20P.2d%201153" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="588 P.2d 1153">588 P.2d 1153</a> (1979) (holding that a deed of trust is a “mortgage” under the statute) by expanding the definition of “redemptioner” to include deed of trust beneficiaries and <a id="p761" href="#p761" data-label="761" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*761</a>successors in interest. Then, in 2013, after the Court of Appeals’ opinions, the legislature amended the redemption statute. Now, the statute reads that a redemptioner includes any claimant having a lien “subsequent in priority” instead of “subsequent in time” to the foreclosing lien. RCW 6.23.010(1)(b).</p>
    <p id="b825-4" data-blocks='[["BL_825.5",825,[127,681,1251,731]]]'>¶9 Generally, statutory redemption arises when a senior lienholder<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> forecloses on the property, thereby extinguishing any junior liens. After the foreclosure sale, statutory redemption gives junior lienholders a grace period beyond the sale to salvage something — i.e., the junior lienholder can “redeem the land” by purchasing the land at the sale price, with interest and taxes, from the purchaser. “[T]he idea is that only one whose title or lien has been extinguished may have ‘another bite of the apple.’ ” 27 Marjorie Dick Rombauer, Washington Practice: Creditors’ Remedies — Debtors’ Relief § 3.19(b), at 163 (1998). Generally, under the statute, the redemptioner may redeem the property within one year after the date of the sale. RCW 6.23.020.</p>

In this case, Bank B would be a valid redemptioner because its lien was recorded subsequent in time to Bank A’s and because its interest in the land will be extinguished if Bank A forecloses on the land. Changing the facts, as mentioned above, if Bank B recorded before Bank A recorded its interest in the property, Bank B would have priority over Bank A. Bank A would be the junior lienholder and a valid redemptioner even though Bank A temporally obtained its lien first. This is how the recording act and the redemption statute operate.</p>

Equity Investors, </em><a href="/wash-2d/81/0886-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="81 Wash. 2d 886" data-case-ids="1064069" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/81/0886-01">81 Wn.2d 886</a>, 896-97, <a href="/citations/?q=506%20P.2d%2020" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="506 P.2d 20">506 P.2d 20</a> (1973). In other words, once a lien for future advances is recorded, it takes priority over subsequently recorded liens, even where an obligation under the lien for future advances does not in fact arise until after the subsequent lien is recorded. Viewed in this light, a future lien for unpaid condominium assessments is established at the time the condominium declaration is recorded, even though it may not be enforceable until the unit owner defaults on his or her assessments, if ever.</p>

This interpretation misreads the statutory operation because, as explained above, an association establishes its right to priority under its declaration and the statute when no assessments are yet due.

To read the statute any other way would create the result that lienholders could lose their claim to any interest in the property, and the redemption statute would have no application. Both the recording act and redemption statute have operated in Washington for over 100 years. When the legislature enacted the Condominium Act, it was within the context of the recording act and redemption statute. The legislature did not provide that parties like Bank of America, who record its interest, to not only lose their priority to condominium associations but also lose the statutory right of redemption.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

The Condominium Act creates an exception to the recording act and can alter the established priorities. Here, the effect of the foreclosure lawsuit was to give the Condominium Association’s lien priority over Bank of America’s interest, bringing Bank of America within the redemption statute provisions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

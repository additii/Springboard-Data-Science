There was no error committed in refusing to give the requested instruction No. 1 for appellant, as there was no testimony warranting the submission of the question of a guarantee to the jury, and the court properly stated in instruction No. 4, given on its own motion, “There is no question of guarantee in this lawsuit.”</p>

It appears, however, from the record that the stipulation referred to was filed on November 30, 1932. The parties at that time could not have had in mind exemptions under act 102 of 1933, because that act was not passed until March 16, 1933, long after the stipulation referred to was filed. It clearly appears that the question of exemption under act 102 was never called to the attention of the trial court, and the trial court did not pass on this question, and it therefore cannot be considered here. Besides, the judgment sued on was long before the passage of the act, and the issues were made up before the act was passed, and it has no application to the facts in this case. But it is unnecessary to discuss or construe act 102, because, as we said, it was not an issue in the court below.</p>

The facts with reference to A. B. Banks’ receiving $150,000, paid as a dividend by the Vann M. Howell Company, are not disputed. We think the record shows conclusively that, at the time the resolution was passed and the dividend paid, the Vann M. Howell Company was hopelessly insolvent, and had no earnings out of which to pay a dividend; that this condition of the company, and the fact that it paid this dividend, was unknown to the appellee, and the record shows that it was concealed from it.</p>

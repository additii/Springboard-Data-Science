The suit was brought to recover back taxes alleged to be due upon the intangible value of the company’s capital stock, but interrogatories propounded to the company developed the fact that it owned no property in this State except its real estate, and about that time the opinion of this court was delivered in the case of <em>State ex rel.

An amended complaint, was filed, in which it was alleged that the company owned large tracts of timbered lands in the counties of Desha, Phillips, Monroe and Arkansas, which had been grossly under-assessed for purposes of taxation for the years 1915 to 1925, inclusive.</p>

Witnesses who testified on this feature of the case differed widely as to what per cent, of the value had been assessed, some placing it higher and others lower than the .30 per cent, found by the court. Without reviewing this testimony, we announce our conclusion to be that the finding of the court below on this question does not appear to be against the preponderance of the evidence.</p>

It was also <a id="p959" href="#p959" data-label="959" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*959</a>shown that, during the years for which the State asks back assessments, large quantities of the timber had been stolen, and .that in recent years large quantities had been sold, and that the value of the lands was proportionately reduced.</p>

The court found the value of the Big Island lands for the years 1915 to 1925, inclusive, to be $50 per acre, and the value of all the other groups to be $33.33 for each of these years, and directed that they be back-assessed for all those years at 30 per cent, of the value stated, less credits for the timber stolen and sold. No attempt was made to.show from what tracts of land timber had been sold or stolen, and the court directed that the total amount of these two items be apportioned to the entire acreage, and the valuations were credited with these apportioned amounts. The valuations thus fixed by the court were further reduced by the valuations upon which taxes had been paid.</p>

A' demurrer to this complaint was sustained, and the State appealed; Upon the appeal to this court it was held that, where a corporation has paid the taxes on the annual assessments made on its property, the State could not recover additional taxes, where a mere mistake had been made in assessing the property too low, and that a review of the assessments by the courts would be permitted only when the assessing boards or officers had proceeded on the wrong basis of valuation, in omitting some property or element of value or in adopting the wrong basis in estimating value, and it was further held that the policy of the law was to treat the find-’ ing of the assessors, supervising boards and commissions as final, except when otherwise expressly provided by the statute.</p>

But this is not true. It had the right to demand that no unequal burden be imposed upon it by taxation. The duty to contribute to the support of the State G-ovp.mmerit by the payment of taxes is imposed upon all persons owning property subject to taxation. The Constitution provides that this burden shall be apportioned among them according to the value of their property, to be ascertained as directed by law. When therefore the property of a few is taxed according to its value, and of all others at one-half its value, then the few are required to contribute double' their portion of the burden. This is manifestly a wrong, and justice demands that it be redressed whenever it can be done conformably to the laws. * * * In this case the county court acquired jurisdiction, by the appeal of the bridge company, to grant relief from the illegal, erroneous, or unequal assessment of appellant’s property, but did not acquire the right or authority to make the valuation of all real property in the county for the purposes of taxation, in all cases in which it had not been done, the true value, by raising it, or to change the valuation of any property except the bridge. The assessment of no property can be increased without notice first given to the owner by the board of equalization. How, then, was the county court to afford relief to appellant? The only relief it could have afforded was to reduce the valuation so as to make it conform to the standard adopted in the valuation of the ■ other real property in the county, or the average valuation of such property. Why should not this relief be granted? The valuation of property is only a constitutional means adopted for the purpose of making the burdens of government bear upon each taxpayer in proportion'to the value of his property. The relief suggested accomplishes that end in this case. By granting it a constitutional right will be enforced, and by denying it will be withheld, because the means devised for its enforcement were not adopted.

That it should be thought necessary to make such a contention argues strongly against the merit of the State’s case, for all the taxes assessed against the company’s land have been paid, and this suit was brought only to collect additional taxes which it is contended should be paid on all the lands. But, as the question has been raised and is insisted upon, we decide it.</p>

The lands of a corporation might be sold in satisfaction of a decree rendered under the sections quoted from for taxes on other corporate property, but we think these sections mean, as applied to the facts of this case, where the taxes on lands only are involved, that the court is merely authorized to find in the decree the amount of the taxes due and to declare the same to be a lien on the laud <a id="p974" href="#p974" data-label="974" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*974</a>involved, and to order each tract of land sold for the taxes due thereon, unless the same are paid within three months of the date of the decree.</p>

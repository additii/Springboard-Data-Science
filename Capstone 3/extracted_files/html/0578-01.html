The judge further advised prospective jurors that Kale-baugh was presumed innocent and that the State had the burden of proving each and every element beyond a reasonable doubt.

The majority reviews the unpreserved claim under RAP 2.5 because Kalebaugh identifies an error that “implicates a constitutional interest” and the trial “ ‘court could have corrected the error.’ ” Majority at 583-84 (quoting <em>State v. O’Hara, </em><a href="/wash-2d/167/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="167 Wash. 2d 91" data-case-ids="4004888" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/167/0091-01">167 Wn.2d 91</a>, 100, <a href="/citations/?q=217%20P.3d%20756" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="217 P.3d 756">217 P.3d 756</a> (2009)). But we have consistently emphasized that RAP 2.5 does not afford review of every error that <em>implicates </em>a constitutional right but only errors that <em>actually prejudiced </em>a defendant’s constitutional rights at trial. See, <em>e.g., O’Hara, </em>167 Wn.2d at 98 (“[T]he appellant must ‘identify a constitutional error and show how the alleged error actually affected the [appellant]’s rights at trial.’ ” (second alteration in original) <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>(quoting <em>State v.

It is not plausible to believe the jury was misled by the preliminary oral instruction delivered to the entire venire before voir dire when they were later given specific and accurate oral and written instructions.

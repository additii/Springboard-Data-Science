When justified, these protective frisks do not violate the constitutional prohibi<a id="p864" href="#p864" data-label="864" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*864</a>tion against unreasonable invasions of individual privacy. In this case, we are asked to further define the permissible scope of these protective frisks. An officer stopped Tanner Zachary Roy Russell for violating several minor traffic laws. The officer recognized Russell from a previous encounter where Russell told officers he was not armed, when in fact he had a small gun in his pocket. Fearing for his safety, the officer frisked Russell for weapons and felt a small box in Russell’s pants pocket. The officer removed the box, opened it, and found a syringe filled with methamphetamine. We hold that the initial protective frisk was justified to protect officer safety, but the warrantless search of the container was not because it exceeded the permissible scope of a protective frisk.</p>

Officer Makein saw the cyclist change into the left lane and travel for several blocks in the direction of oncoming traffic, another traffic violation. Officer Makein pulled the cyclist over at a nearby gas station.</p>
    <p id="b928-6" data-blocks='[["BL_928.7",928,[202,1724,1249,520]]]'>¶3 After pulling the cyclist over, Officer Makein recognized him as Russell, a passenger in a traffic stop that the officer made a week earlier. During the prior stop, Officer Makein asked Russell if he had any weapons on him of any kind and Russell said no. But during the course of the stop, another officer found a loaded .22 caliber, derringer-style handgun in Russell’s pocket. The gun was a very small and easily concealable weapon meant for close-range shooting. The officers confiscated the gun and issued Russell a citation.</p>

He was especially suspicious because Russell had lied about the gun during the previous stop and because the gun was so concealable. During the frisk Officer Makein felt a small, hard container in Russell’s pants pocket. He testified that the container was approximately six inches long, four inches wide, and “an inch or two” deep.

      <em>Id. </em>at 18-19. Based on that testimony, the trial court made a finding of fact that Russell consented to the search of the container. Officer Makein opened the container and found one syringe containing methamphetamine.

Russell moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that the search was unlawful, and the trial court granted his motion and dismissed the case. The trial court found that although the initial stop was justified, the frisk was not because the stop occurred in a well-lit area and Russell did <a id="p866" href="#p866" data-label="866" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*866</a>not verbally threaten the officer, nor did he make any threatening gestures or movements.

Not only do we not need to consider this issue given that Officer Makein’s search went beyond the permissible scope of a <em>Terry </em>frisk and therefore there are other grounds for exclusion, but also I am unwilling to foreclose the applicability of the doctrine to <em>Terry </em>frisks on the facts before us. Second, the majority concludes that “while the initial protective frisk was permissible, the officer violated [Tanner Zachary Roy] Russell’s constitutional rights when he removed a small container from his pocket and searched it without a warrant.” Majority at 872. I partially disagree. Russell’s constitutional rights were not violated when the small container was removed from his pocket. His rights were violated immediately after, when the officer realized that it did not contain a weapon and searched the container anyway. Removing a container from a jacket that could potentially contain a weapon does not require a warrant as part of an otherwise lawful <em>Terry </em>stop.

Judge Cole, in delivering the opinion, says: “ Subsequent legislation is relied on to show that the defense of usury is not available. By the law, in force at the time the contract was made, it was usurious and void. To the same effect was the law when the suit was commenced, and by the law of 1856, an usurious contract was declared valid and effectual, only to secure the repayment of the principal sum loaned. But how this <em>latter </em>enactment, even if it attempted it,'could render valid an antecedent contract, which "was void, we do not comprehend. The law of 1856 can have no bearing upon the question. The defense of usury is doubtless available.”</p>

It was held that a promissory note, payable in such bills to a banking corporation, madé while the statute was in force, was void, and that no action could be maintained upon it by the promisees after the statute was repealed. Chief Justice Pai’lcer remarked that, “the subsequent repeal of the act can have no effect upon a contract while it was in force.

It may be well doubted whether the borrower, under an usurious contract, has any antecedent rights of the nature of vested rights, created by this contract, or existing under <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>and by the terms of it,-which the law can affect. Iiow do "Woodruff’s rights stand in a legal point? They are, under and by the terms of the contract, to receive and enjoy until demanded, the money of Scruggs. Scruggs’ rights are' to receive interest and the principal sum when due. But the statute of usury, operating upon 'them, avoided his right to demand them and the legal obligation of "Woodruff to pay. This privilege of refusing to pay the claim upon demand, not under and by virtue of the terms of the contract, or-any presumable intention of the parties different from that which appears upon its face (for Ave think it Avould be doing Wood-ruff* injustice to suppdse he took the money from Scruggs originally Avith the intention of enjoying it without ever repaying), but under, and by virtue of a general law, is the only antecedent right of the defendant which the statute of 1868 can affect. That privilege, and it was nothing more than a privilege, the legislature intended to take away by validating the. contract in this respect. The right of the defendant originated in a statute founded upon policy, intended to protect the needy borrower from the presumed temptation of the lender to demand exorbitant interest for forbearance. That right, of the defendant, to insist upon, a forfeiture by the plaintiff of his debt, Avas a legal right before the repeal, but not an equitable one. The courts of equity do not view the statute as courts of laAV are compelled to do. If a borrower goes into a eoui’t of equity, in respect to a security given in connection with usurious contracts, or to avoid extortion or oppression, the court will always-compel him to pay principal and legal interest, because there is a moral obligation resting on him to do so, and it is equitable that he should be compelled to do it<em>.</em>

This is all the law of 1868 purposes to accomplish.

"We do not agree with counsel in this contention. The burden of proof was upon the plaintiff to prove that the defendant had failed to carry the cotton and deliver it to the consignee. Without making this proof, the plaintiff could not recover at all. Under the statute, there are certain exceptions to tlie general rule of liability. The burden of proof to show that the case.came within one of the exceptions was upon the defendant. Where goods are received in good order on board of a vessel under a bill of lading agreeing- to deliver them at the termination of the voyage in like good order and condition, and the goods, are damaged on the voyage, in a proceeding to recover for the breach of the contract of affreightment, after the amount of damage has been established, the burden lies upon the carrier to show that it was occasioned by one of the perils for which it was not responsible. <em>The Folmina, </em><a href="/us/212/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="212 U.S. 354" data-case-ids="5711214" data-case-paths="/us/212/0354-01">212 U.

A controlling question in each of these cases was whether the suits had been commenced within six months of the date of the completion of the improvement.</p>

The chancellor’s finding is conclusive unless it is against the preponderance of the evidence. We have reached the conclusion that the finding in this case is supported by a <a id="p955" href="#p955" data-label="955" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*955</a>preponderance of the evidence, and the decree is affirmed.”</p>
    <p id="b975-3" data-blocks='[["BL_975.4",975,[152,474,1201,355]]]'>It appears, however, that, while the testimony in the instant case is sufficiently similar to that on the former appeals to render a restatement of the facts unnecessary, the testimony is not identical. There were some depositions which were used in all three cases, hut there was some oral testimony offered at the trial from which this appeal comes.</p>
    <p id="b975-4" data-blocks='[["BL_975.5",975,[151,846,1202,616]]]'>The two former cases were tried before the chancellor, while the instant case was heard by a jury, and the instructions given by the court at this trial show that the liability of the surety on the bond of the principal contractors was made to depend upon the question of the date of the completion of the improvement. The jury was told that the plaintiff subcontractor had the right to recover against the surety of the principal contractors if the suit was brought within six months of the date of the completion of the work, and the verdict in favor of the plaintiff necessarily implies the finding by the jury that the suit was brought within that time.</p>
    <p id="b975-5" data-blocks='[["BL_975.6",975,[150,1478,1206,449]]]'>Although the finding of fact in the instant case is contrary to the finding of fact made by the chancellor in the former cases, the judgment here appealed from must be affirmed if there is any substantial testimony to support the verdict upon which the judgment was rendered, unless it must be reversed for some other reason. The plaintiff here was not a party to either of the former cases, and it is not concluded by the finding of the chancellor in those cases.</p>

It must be remembered that we do not reverse the decrees of chancery courts on the facts unless the findings based on those <a id="p956" href="#p956" data-label="956" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*956</a>facts appear to us to be contrary to the preponderance of the evidence; whereas in appeals from judgments rendered upon verdicts of juries we are required to affirm, so far as the sufficiency of the testimony is concerned, if the testimony tending to support the verdicts is sufficient for that purpose, when given its highest probative value. This results from the fact that in chancery appeals we try the cases <em>de novo, </em>whereas in law cases we do not.</p>

Those cases involved the title to adjoining tracts of land owned by different parties, but the controlling question in each case was whether the land in litigation formed as an accretion to other lands the title to which was not in dispute. In the <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>case the judgment of the court, based upon the verdict of the jury finding that the land in litigation was an accretion, was. not reversed, because that verdict was supported by testimony legally sufficient to support that finding; whereas the decree in the case of <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>based upon the finding that there was no accretion, but an avulsion, was affirmed, because that finding did not appear to be contrary to the preponderance of the evidence. The Simpson case was a chancery case and was tried <em>de novo; </em>the Bush case was a law case and was, therefore, not tried <em>de novo </em>on the appeal.</p>

But there is another question. Appellant asked an instruction numbered 6, reading as follows: “If you find from the testimony in this case that W. F. Schulz was <a id="p957" href="#p957" data-label="957" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*957</a>the architect and had the supervision of the construction of the improvement, and that as such on the 31st day of March, 1927, executed and delivered to the Commissioners of Wharf Improvement District No. 1 of Helena, Arkansas, his ninth and final estimate of the work performed under such contract showing a completion thereof, then you will find that such final estimate constituted an acceptance of the improvement, unless you find that the commissioners of said district expressly repudiated the act of the architect, and gave notice of such repudiation, both to the contractor and to the architect, or took any other course that may have been provided for hy the terms of the contract.”</p>
    <p id="b977-3" data-blocks='[["BL_977.4",977,[173,1080,1200,625]]]'>The court refused to give this instruction as requested, and gave it as amended, and as amended and given it reads as follows: “If you find from the testimony in this case that W.

It was not insisted at the trial below that <a id="p958" href="#p958" data-label="958" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*958</a>the architect was guilty of actual fraud or that inattention and indifference which implied bad faith.</p>
    <p id="b978-3" data-blocks='[["BL_978.4",978,[279,475,1206,559]]]'>The building contract was offered in evidence, and § 39 thereof reads as follows: “Architect’s Decision— ‘The architect shall, within a reasonable time, make decisions on all claims of the owner or contractor and on all other matters relating to the execution and progress of the work or the interpretation of the contract documents. The architect’s decisions, in matters relating to artistic effect, shall be final, if within the terms of the contract documents.

    <p id="b978-6" data-blocks='[["BL_978.7",978,[283,1937,1203,413]],["BL_979.1",979,[145,389,1200,98]]]'>The question here involved is not one of artistic effect; therefore the decision of the architect is not final; but we think the effect of the proviso last quoted is to make it final unless one party or the other questions the decision and requests an arbitration. The language is meaningless if it does not mean this. We, therefore, conclude that instruction numbered 6 should have been given in the form requested, and that it was error to modify <a id="p959" href="#p959" data-label="959" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*959</a>it over appellant’s objection, and for this error tbe .judgment must be reversed, and it is so ordered.</p>

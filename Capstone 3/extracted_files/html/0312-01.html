Defense counsel became concerned that Morgan, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, was exhibiting psychotic symptoms. Morgan’s counsel requested a competency determination and sought an order for involuntary medication to control Morgan’s delusions during trial. The trial judge determined that Morgan was incompetent, appointed a guardian ad litem to represent his interests, and ordered involuntary medication. His trial followed, and the jury unanimously found him to be a sexually violent predator. He is now confined in the Special Commitment Center.</p>

At the age of 13, he pleaded guilty in a juvenile adjudication to indecent liberties with a 15-year-old girl. He was sentenced to 65 weeks in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration (JRA) program, where he participated in sexual deviancy treatment. At the <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>juvenile facility he was found to have limited cognitive skills, he exhibited problems distinguishing between fantasy and reality, and he disclosed stimulating and “pervasive, severely sadistic homicidal fantasies.” 2 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Aug. 7, 2008) at 175. In the opinion of his juvenile rehabilitation counselor, when Morgan left he did not have a “very good grasp on or understanding of his sexual behavior and what would motivate him in that regard.” 1 VRP (Aug. 4-6, 2008) at 41.</p>

During this time he was dismissed from the high school basketball team and briefly suspended from school for uninvited physical contact with peer-aged females. Two weeks after completing treatment, Morgan molested a five-year-old girl and a six-year-old girl at a hotel swimming pool. On the day of the assault, he told police officers he wanted “to see if he could handle being close to kids,” but once he touched the girls, things “got out of hand” and he “had no control over the situation, period.” 2 VRP (Aug. 7, 2008) at 186, 255. He later “said that his victim, quote, wanted me to rape her, end quote.” 1 VRP (Aug. 4-6, 2008) at 60.

He often did not take his medication, which led to involuntary medication throughout 2000 and 2001. While at Monroe, Morgan participated in a sex offender treatment program (SOTP), but his ability to progress appeared to be limited by his psychiatric disorders and developmental limitations. Morgan’s fantasies of using force or coercion increased as he progressed through treatment. He completed the program and upon completion was evaluated at a very high risk to reoffend.</p>

At status conferences in late 2005 and early 2006, Morgan’s counsel disclosed that Morgan was experiencing psychotic symptoms, and a competency hearing was held in February 2006. The trial judge found Morgan incompetent, and Morgan’s attorney, the State, and the trial judge agreed that the SVP trial should proceed. But to “make sure [Morgan’s] interests [were] protected,” the trial judge appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) “with experience in this area.” VRP (Pretrial Hr’gs) (July 25, 2005; Feb. 23, Apr. 21, Aug. 30, 2006) at 7-8, 19.</p>
    <p id="b381-5" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[162,1028,1257,1193]]]'>¶8 In June 2006, Morgan’s counsel moved for an order to involuntarily medicate Morgan to control his delusions during trial. The trial judge initially granted the motion orally but later accepted the State’s request to consider additional evidence and weigh different interests before making a final ruling. During an in-chambers conference at the end of August 2006, counsel, the GAL, and the trial judge discussed the procedure they would use for hearing further evidence on that motion. The trial judge, a court reporter, and the GAL were physically present in chambers, and counsel participated by phone. Morgan was not present. Defense counsel and the GAL expressed concern that failing to medicate Morgan might deprive him of a fair trial because the jury might think, “Well, he’s so crazy, he should be locked up.” VRP (Pretrial Hr’gs) (July 25, 2005; Feb. 23, Apr. 21, Aug. 30, 2006) at 30. The GAL noted that “Morgan himself is violently [and] vehemently against any kind of involuntary medication.” Id. at 31. The trial judge asked the GAL to meet with Morgan’s psychiatrist and requested a written report from the psychiatrist with the medical background necessary to decide the involuntary medication issue.</p>

Dr. Sziebert filed a report that detailed Morgan’s medica<a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>tion history and discussed the efficacy of involuntary medication in his case. Dr. Sziebert indicated Morgan did not meet the Special Commitment Center’s requirements for being involuntarily medicated because he did not have a grave disability or present a danger to himself or others. He opined that involuntary medication “may benefit Mr. Morgan at his civil commitment trial from the standpoint of helping him curb his impulses and inappropriate behavior.” Clerk’s Papers at 72. The GAL also submitted a written report noting Morgan’s history of positive results from involuntary administration of antipsychotic medications, acknowledging Morgan’s opposition to medication, and concluding that it was in Morgan’s best interests to be involuntarily medicated. The trial judge ordered involuntary medication.</p>
    <p id="b382-4" data-blocks='[["BL_382.5",382,[227,1197,1253,1073]]]'>¶10 A jury trial was held in 2008. The State’s expert, Dr. Judd, testified that Morgan had two mental abnormalities — paraphilia and pedophilia — and a personality disorder — antisocial personality disorder — that caused him serious difficulties in controlling his sexual behavior. Dr. Judd also gave Morgan a provisional diagnosis of sexual sadism. He testified to the varying and inconsistent accounts that Morgan gave throughout the 1990s and up until the time of the SVP trial of the indecent liberties incident, all of which depart from the official report, oftentimes indicating that the contact was consensual but at other times emphasizing the use of force. An SOTP treatment provider opined that Morgan had not internalized his relapse prevention plan and that she did not expect the skills and interventions he learned in the program to be retained if he did not continue to work on them. Morgan’s expert, Dr. Wollert, disagreed with several of Dr. Judd’s diagnoses and testified that Morgan’s brain had likely matured since his offenses, lowering his recidivism risk. A unanimous jury found Morgan to be a sexually violent predator.</p>

It ensures that juries are presented with an individual who can understand the nature of the proceedings against him.

The Department has offered no assurance that the treatment modalities at the SCC can effectively address the kind of mental illness generally treated via civil commitment under chapter 71.05 RCW. The scholarly research available suggests that an incompetent person will not be able to participate in SVP treatment. “[A]ttempting to curb the compulsively lurid behaviors of an SVP that precipitate within the matrix of a florid psychosis or severe cognitive impairments would likely prove futile. . . .

This case presents a question of first impression for this court, and no court faced with this exact question has found a due process violation. But several of the courts that have rejected a due process right have relied on a flawed balancing of the <em>Mathews </em>factors. Much like the majority does, they have ignored concerns about effective SVP treatment and the indisputable relationship between competency and the meaningful exercise of the right to counsel and other essential procedural safeguards. <em>See, e.g., Moore, </em><a href="/citations/?q=237%20P.3d%20530" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="237 P.3d 530">237 P.3d at 543-47</a>.</p>

Although the weight of authority from other jurisdictions has come to the opposite conclusion, no court has presented an analysis that justifies its result. I would not parrot the reasoning of those courts as a substitute for a hard look at what the constitution expects of a justice system. Instead, I would hold that the trial rights afforded to an accused SVP — rights that are given in recognition of the caution with which the government must <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>proceed when contemplating a liberty deprivation of this nature — have little force if an accused SVP is not competent.

But as noted, those very rights — especially the critical right to counsel — have little meaning if the accused SVP is incompetent. It is also worth pointing out that Stout did not make a <em>Mathews </em>argument, which the court noted “tiplped] the third factor of the <em>Mathews </em>test in favor of the State,” as the court had no counterargument to the State’s contention that providing a confrontation right would be prohibitively expensive. <em><a href="/citations/?q=237%20P.3d%20530" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="237 P.3d 530">Id.</a> </em>at 372 n.11.

I write separately to address the majority’s public trial analysis. The majority concludes that the August 2006 pretrial meeting in chambers between the trial judge, the guardian ad litem, and counsel (but not Mr. Morgan) was a “status conference” to which the public trial right did not attach. Majority at 326.1 disagree.</p>

It was identified as a motion hearing at the time of the hearing. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Pretrial Hr’gs) (Aug. 30, 2006) at 28 (“[T]his is the State’s motion for further proceedings related to involuntarily medicating Mr. Morgan.”). Further, it was identified as the hearing at which the State wanted to bolster its factual record and legal argument about why forcible medication was permissible, a very nontrivial subject. <em>Id. </em>at 29. And in the judge’s order to involuntarily medicate Mr. Morgan, entered in December 2006, he seems to have referred back to the August hearing in saying that he had considered “oral argument from counsel.” Suppl.

Scales, at the April term, 1867, of the .chancery court of the State of Tennessee, for the district composed of the county of Williamson, filed their bill to have the will and codicils thereto, of their said ancestors, construed, and the rights of the several legatees thereunder declared and settled, and to have trustees appointed for such of the legatees as required trustees under the will, among whom was the complainant, Mary R.; that that chancery court, in accordance with the prayer of the bill, ascertained and declared the rights of the .several legatees, under the will of Scalps, and appointed Robert II. Jackson, then the husband of Mary R., her trustee, to receive and hold in trust, for her and her children, the share she was entitled to under the will of her ancestor, and the income, interest and proceeds arising therefrom, to be applied to the support of her and her children ; that Jackson accepted such trust, and received the share of said Mary R., of the estate of her ancestor, Scales, consisting of one negro man, valued at $900, and the aggregate sum of $3,309‡^ in cash. Subsequently, Jackson died, and his widow, the complainant, Mary R., intermarried with her present husband, and complainant, Wm. Brooks.</p>

      <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>■ There is, perhaps, 110 better settled doctrine in the equity jurisprudence of this country than that a breach of trust creates but a simple contract debt. In England, before the statute of 3 and <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Will.%204" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="4 Will. 4">4 <em>Will., </em>4</a>, where, in the creation of a trust, the trustee bound himself, by deed, to apply the trust fund in a particular manner, that would create a specialty debt against him, and, after his death, against his estate; but, since that statute, the distinction between simple contract debts and specialty debts, in that country, seems to have become of but little practical importance. <em>We </em>find that the high court of chancery of that country, in the case of <em>Adey v. </em>Arnold, <em>15 Eng. L. and Eq., </em>268, where, by deed of indorsement under seal, appointing new trustees, and executed by them, a trust fund was assigned to the new trustees “ to hold unto them, their executors, &amp;c., as their own money, property and effects; but nevertheless upon the trusts and for the ends and purposes declared by the indenture,” &amp;c., it was held, by Lord Chancellor St. Leonards, that there was, in that case, no declaration of trust by the new trustees, and that the breach of trust did not constitute a specialty debt. That learned Chancellor, bringing various authorities in review on- the subject, said, “there is no better established general proposition than that a breach of trust does not constitute a specialty debt, but that it is equally clear that when there is a deed executed by the trustee, containing a declaration by him that he will apply the trust fund in a particular manner, but which he had misapplied, that such a breach would constitute a specialty debt, because be had declared, under seal, that he would not apply the fund as he ultimately did apply it,” citing the cases of <em>Verron v. Vandry, </em>2 <em>Atk., </em>119; <em>Cox v. Bateman, </em>2 <em>Ves., sen., </em>19.</p>
    <p id="b346-5" data-blocks='[["BL_346.4",346,[291,2081,1208,323]],["BL_347.1",347,[128,402,1215,383]]]'>Though it will be observed, that in England, where there has been given a priority, in some instances, to specialty debts, created by deed under seal, over simple contract debts, the. courts have been slow to imply a covenant from wmr’ds that do not import one; but -where the words of the deed, executed by the trustee, are clearly to the effect that the trustee undertook <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>to apply the fund in the mode prescribed by the deed, and the deed was executed by him, it would be tantamount to a covenant ; but, as we have seen, in the case of <em>Adey v. Arnold, </em>it was held that where there were no words contained in the instrument creating the trust, signed by the trustee, Avhich could by any possibility raise a covenant, the breach is a simple breach of trust, and forms only a simple contract debt.</p>
    <p id="b347-4" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[128,797,1214,889]]]'>But in the United States, as in England, real estate is now assets for the payment of all debts, whether by specialty or simple contract, and in many of the American States, and particularly in this State, as we will presently see, the distinction between specialty debts and simple contract debts, in the administration and settlement of the estates of deceased persons, is abolished. By our statute, <em>Gould’s Digest, chap. </em>4, <em>sec. </em>99, it is provided that the priority of claims against the estates of deceased persons, are declared to be: “ 1. Euneral expenses; 2. Expenses of last sickness, wages of servants and demands for medicine, and medical attendance during last sickness; 3. Judgment rendered against the deceased, in his lifetime, and which are liens on the lands of the deceased, &amp;c.; 4.

By this we-do not wish to leave the impression that the counsel for the appellees would for a moment entertain a proposition so absurd; but, admit for the present that the decree, appointing Jackson trustee, was a judgment against him, Avas it a judgment capable of creating a lien upon thé lands that he died possessed of, if he <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>died possessed of any ? It certainly would not be contended that it was. Our statute, <em>chap. </em>96, <em>sec. </em>4, <em>Gould’s </em>Digest, provides that judgments and decrees rendered in the circuit court' shall be liens on the real estate of the person against whom they are rendered, situate in the county for which the court is held. Section 5, of the same chapter, provides that such liens shall commence on the day of the rendition of the judgment, and shall continue for three years, subject to be revived-, as provided by that chapter. In construing the 99i/i <em>sec. of chap. </em>4, <em>Gould’s </em>Digest, prescribing the mode of the classification of claims against the estates of deceased persons, as relates to claims having priority over contract debts, it must be done with reference to the 4iA and <em>5th secs, </em>of the <em>96th chap., </em>of the <em>Digest; </em>and, in so doing, we think it is evident that it was the intention of the Legislature to make those judgments only, that were rendered by the courts within our own State, and that were liens or capable of being liens upon the real estate of the deceased, during his lifetime, had he possessed any, and subsisting as such liens at the time of his death. The trust reposed in Jackson, by the Tennessee chancery court, as trustee for his wife, the appellee, Mary R., and her children, was but an ordinary trust, imposing on him the ordinary duties of trustees of that class,.as that of taking possession of and controlling the trust fund or property, and of keeping, preserving and properly using the same according to the intention of the grantor, as can be drawn from the instrument creating the trust, and to duly account therefor; and a failure of the trustee to perform such duties, or any that may be imposed upon him, under our laws, on the subject of administration, would create a liability against him only in the nature of a contract debt; and, if to be collected from his estate after his death, would constitute a fourth class claim, unless the claim or liability against him had, before his death, been elevated to the dignity of judgment, and was, at the time of his death, a lien, or capable of being a lien, upon the real estate, had he died possessed of any. This brings us now to <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>the consideration, directly, of the question raised by the appellant’s motion in the court below, to dismiss the bill for want of the affidavit required by law for the authentication of ■claims against the estate of deceased persons, &amp;c. <em>Chap. </em>4, <em>sec. </em>102, <em>Gould’s </em>Digest, requires all persons exibiting claims against the estates of deceased persons, to append to their claim or demand the affidavit required by that chapter, of the justness of' the demand. The 101th section of that chapter provides as follows: “ If any affidavit, as required by this act for authenticating claims against deceased persons, be not produced in an action against an executor or administrator, for a debt against tlie deceased, the court shall, on motion, enter a judgment of non-suit against the plaintiff; and the affidavit must appear to have been made prior to the commeneement of the action.” The motion, in the court below, to dismiss, doubtless was made under that statute. The counsel for the appellees insist that the court below did not err, in overruling the motion of the appellant to dismiss, and in support of their position state that, “ it so happened that the motion to dismiss was put in before the filing of the affidavitand they gravely ask-, “ is this enough to turn complainants awray from the court, they standing there, offering to file the statutory affidavits ? Is this sort of sharp practice to be indulged in by a court of equity, and by this court, <em>to the denial of justice ?” </em>It might well be said that the complainant, in the court below', not having complied with the requirement of the statute, by filing the statutory affidavit, after the motion to dismiss for .the vrant of the affidavit v'as made, had no standing in court at all, because the statute requires that the affidavit should not only be made, but unquestionably requires it <em>to </em>“ <em>appear to have keen made prior to the commencement of the action.”</em>

It is irresistible, from the language of the statute, that the court below had not the power to deprive the appellant of the defense afforded him by the statute, by means of the motion to dismiss, and which perhaps it was his duty to make, by allowing the appellees, at that stage of the proceeding, to come in and file the affidavit, or to dispense with the affidavit altogether.</p>

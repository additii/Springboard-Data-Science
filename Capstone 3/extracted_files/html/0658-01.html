The appellee alleged in her complaint that the appellant, Wade Erwin, came to her home in Sharp County, and, in the absence of her husband, unlawfully, wilfully and contemptuously did insult, disturb, disquiet and threaten her by the use of indecent language and proposals; that, because of said wrongful acts, words and proposals made to her by appellant, she became ill, excited and nervous; that her moral sensibilities and ideals of decency and propriety were shocked, and that she suffered, because of said acts and proposals, a nervous collapse and great pain, anguish and humiliation.- She alleges that she was pregnant with child; that, because- of her mental condition, nervous and,physical <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>shock brought about by the improper conduct of the appellant, she was caused to have a miscarriage, and was caused great physical pain and suffering and irreparable injury tó her health; that she was confined to her bed, and forced to expend large sums for doctor’s bills and medicine; that her health was permanently injured. She also alleges that, prior to the misconduct of appellant mentioned in her complaint, she was a strong healthy woman, able to do her housework and assist her husband in the fields, making and harvesting his crops; that since the acts complained of she had been nervous, irritable and unable to perform her necessary duties or assist her husband as before; that, because of said wrongful acts and proposals, she had been damaged in the sum of $5,000 actual damages, and in the sum of $2,500 punitive damages. She prays judgment in the sum of $7,500, and costs.</p>

Appellant remained sitting there <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>talking, to appellee; her husband went on to the field, and, when she began to stack the dishes, appellant said: “I will give you my hand that I am your friend,” and she told him she never expected him to be anything else but her friend. He then said: “I keep secrets, too,” and by that time witness said appellant was reaching for her hand, and he acted as though he was going to draw her to him and kiss her. She was shocked, and told him she thought he Was a Christian man; that he took hold of her right hand and she jerked back, and told him to go back where her husband was. He then asked her if he could stop as he came back by, and she told him he could not, but to- go back where her husband was. He then said: “You will let me stop and be a friend to you for some money, won’t you?” and she told him, if he had any money to give away, to give it to her husband. He then said: “I would rather give it to you.” She testified that he asked her if she were going to tell her husband, and she said “Yes.” He then said: “If you do, he might think something if you did. ’ ’</p>

Huskey testified that he treated Mrs. Milligan, appellee, on April 20th; that she was suffering- with an abortion, and was in a serious condition. A hypothetical question was asked, him, which recited the facts testified to by Mrs. Milligan, and closed as follows: “What in your judgment would be the cause of the miscarriage or abortion?” He answered that would be a sufficient cause for the abortion in the absence of any other condition in the way of disease or injury; that it would lead him to the natural conclusion that the severe mental strain of her condition would be the cause of her trouble.</p>

He testified about the condition of his wife and her inability to perform the services she had been performing, but he did not testify as to any acts or words of the appellant. He could not do so because he was not present. No one testified about the acts of Erwin, except Mrs.' Milligan, the wife of Noble Milligan. This evidence of Mrs. Milligan could not be considered in her husband’s case, and, since no one else testified to anything that was done or said by Erwin, there was no evidence in Noble Milligan’s case that Erwin did or said anything.</p>

It is argued that, as both plaintiffs were interested in the result, neither was competent to testify in the cause. But either was a competent Avitness in his or her own behalf, and the rule is settled by the previous decisions of this court that, in cases in which a party may be a witness for himself, marriage is not. a disqualification as to liis'interest in the case, notAvithstanding the other pa,rty to the marriage is a party to the suit.” $o, in the instant case, the Avife ivas a coMpetent witness in her own case, and might testify in her own behalf, but she could not testify in the case of her husband.</p>

    <p id="b680-5" data-blocks='[["BL_680.4",680,[256,656,1200,403]]]'>Again we said: “This court has held that the fact that a husband and wife have joint claims in an action, does not prevent either of them from testifying in his or her own case, but that the testimony of the wife cannot be considered in the case of the husband, and the testimony of the husband cannot be considered in the case of the wife.” <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em><a href="/ark/180/1144-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="180 Ark. 1144" data-case-ids="1393629" data-case-paths="/ark/180/1144-01">180 Ark. 1144</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=24%20S.W.2d%20960" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="24 S.W.2d 960">24 S.

Since there was no competent evidence in this case, and as no one except the wife can testify to anything done or said by Erwin, the judgment in the case of Noble C.

The rule is well established that there can be no recovery for fright or mental pain and anguish caused by negligence where there is no physical injury. •But the rule is equally well established that a recovery may be had where the injury is caused by wilful or intentional conduct.

Besides, the appellant asked practically the same question when his physician, Dr. Tibbies, was testifying, and in his question there was nothing said about the ride in the truck.

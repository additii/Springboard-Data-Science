Objection was made to the introduction of the photograph upon the ground that it had not been properly identified. In ruling upon the objection made, the court said there was no testimony to show that the picture was taken from the negative prepared by the photographer, and that the photograph was hearsay evidence, but that, as the witness had testified that the photograph resembled the place of the fire, he would allow the picture to be offered in evidence and be considered by the jury for what it was worth. Objection was made to this comment, whereupon the court said: “I want to make myself clear on that, gentlemen. The witness testified that this picture resembles the condition down there at the time ho saw it on the evening of the 23rd, and the picture may go, and it goes as the testimony of this witness — simply as a picture which he says resembles the condition there at the time, but there is no legal testimony here that the jury could consider as to who made that picture or where it came from.” After this remark, defendant refused to offer the photograph in evidence-, and now insists that the comment of the court destroyed its value as testimony and constituted a charge on the weight of the testimony.</p>

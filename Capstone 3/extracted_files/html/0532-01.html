Esther Kim, the personal representative of Bae’s estate, brought tort claims against several individuals involved in Bae’s care. This appeal concerns claims against Alpha Nursing &amp; Services Inc. and two of its nurses, who did not provide nursing services to Bae but who are alleged to have observed signs of abuse and physical assault that should have been reported to the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and law enforcement. The primary issue before us is whether the abuse of vulnerable adults act (AVAA), chapter 74.34 RCW,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> creates an implied cause of action against mandated reporters who fail to report abuse.</p>

Binondo and Salzbrun heard a “thump” or a “thud” from an adjacent room and went into that room. Binondo saw a woman, now identified as Bae, lying on the floor. Binondo at least suggested to Bae’s caregiver, Irawati, that she may want to call 911. Irawati responded that Bae “falls a lot” and that she would call Gretchen Dhaliwal, Lakeside’s owner who is also a nurse. Irawati put Bae back in bed, and Binondo saw that Bae was moving her legs.

Bae appeared to Thomas as either “heavily sedated” or at a “decreased level of consciousness.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 767, 179. Thomas looked at Bae’s records and determined that Bae was not prescribed morphine.

Thomas informed Susan Gange, Alpha’s director of nursing, that she had called DSHS on March 30 to report her concerns about Bae. At Gange’s request, Thomas prepared a written statement for Alpha’s files describing what she had told DSHS. That same day, Thomas told Binondo about her observations at Lakeside. Based on that conversation, Binondo believed the woman she heard fall may have been the same woman Thomas observed being dragged into the bathroom. Binondo spoke with Gange about the fall, and Gange instructed Binondo to report the incident to DSHS.</p>

It was not until 1999 that the legislature removed all reference to adults from the ACA. <em>See </em>Laws of 1999, ch. 176, §§ 27-33; <em>see also </em>Final B. Rep. on Substitute H.B. 1620, 56th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 1999) (explaining that this bill consolidated and made uniform the three statutes that required the reporting and investigation of abuse of vulnerable adults).</p>
    <p id="b598-3" data-blocks='[["BL_598.4",598,[201,1403,1248,692]]]'>¶ 19 Furthermore, the AVAA is similar to the ACA in both structure and purpose. First, vulnerable adults who are the victims of abuse or neglect are within the class of people for whose “special” benefit the legislature enacted the reporting statute. When the legislature consolidated provisions protecting vulnerable adults into chapter 74.34 RCW, it declared, “The purpose of chapter 74.34 RCW is to provide the department [of social and health services] and law enforcement agencies with the authority to investigate complaints of abandonment, abuse, financial exploitation, or neglect of vulnerable adults and to provide protective services and legal remedies to protect these vulnerable adults.” Laws of 1999, ch. 176, § 1.</p>

Like the ACA, the AVAA provides immunity for those who in good faith make a report or testify about alleged abuse or neglect under the chapter. <em>See </em>RCW <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>74.34.050. As this court observed in <em>Beggs, </em>the provision of immunity from liability implies the possibility of civil liability. <em>See </em>171 Wn.2d at 78. Furthermore, the legislature clearly anticipated the possibility of liability for failing to report. In the same provision that grants immunity for those who report in good faith, the legislature limited liability for permissive reporters, providing, “The making of <em>permissive </em>reports as allowed in this chapter does not create any duty to report and no civil liability shall attach for any failure to make a <em>permissive </em>report as allowed under this chapter.” RCW 74.34.050(1) (emphasis added). By specifying that permissive reporters are not liable for failing to report, but remaining silent as to mandated reporters, the legislature implicitly recognized the existence of a cause of action against mandated reporters who fail to report.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The purpose of the AVAA is to give DSHS and law enforcement authority to investigate alleged abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults, and to provide those adults with protective services and legal remedies. Laws of 1999, ch. 176, § 1. Implying a cause of action for failing to report suspected abuse or neglect is consistent with the legislature’s intent to ensure that DSHS and law enforcement investigate cases of suspected abuse, and are able to provide protective services to abused vulnerable adults.</p>
    <p id="b600-3" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[202,965,1252,472]]]'>¶22 One notable difference between the ACA and the AVAA is that “[i]n addition to other remedies available under the law,” the AVAA explicitly includes a cause of action for vulnerable adults who have suffered abuse or neglect either while residing in a facility, or, for those residing at home, “who receive! ] care from a home health, hospice, or home care agency, or an individual provider.” RCW 74.34.200(1). The ACA does not explicitly create any similar cause of action.</p>
    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[201,1470,1248,692]]]'>¶23 This AVAA provision does not preclude also finding an implied cause of action against mandated reporters for failure to report. The express liability provision provides redress for <em>actual </em>abuse; it does not provide redress for those who breach their mandatory reporting duty. “Courts have consistently held that when a statute gives a new right and no specific remedy, the common law will provide a remedy.” <em>State ex rel.

Although the <em>Broad </em>court specified that the documents had to be transmitted to the central authority within the 90-day period, that case dealt with a single defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 673.

        <em> </em>The legislative history of RCW 74.34.050(1) supports this conclusion. The original AVAA addressed reporting by mandated reporters. <em>See </em>former ch. 74.34 RCW (1984). Two years after its enactment, the legislature expanded the list of mandated reporters and added permissive reporting. Laws of 1986, ch. 187, § 1. The legislature also amended the civil liability provision to provide immunity from suit for permissive reporters who failed to report. <em><a href="/citations/?q=786%20P.2d%20265" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="786 P.2d 265">Id.</a> </em>§ 3(1) (“The making of permissive reports ... does not create any duty to report and no civil liability shall attach for any failure to make a permissive report....’’). Given that the legislature was clearly contemplating both mandated and permissive reporters, we consider its silence with regard to civil liability against mandated reporters a deliberate decision to leave the door open for an action against mandated reporters who fail to report. Similarly, in 1999, the legislature again contemplated both mandated reporters and a limitation on liability against permissive reporters. In the original House Bill 1620, the legislature completely struck permissive reporters’ protection from civil liability for failure to report. H.B. 1620, at 6-7, 56th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 1999). However, in Substitute House Bill 1620, the bill that ultimately became law, the legislature retained the protections for permissive reporters but did not extend such protections to mandated reporters who fail to report. <em>See </em>Laws of 1999, ch. 176, § 6. At the time, the legislature was clearly contemplating the roles of both mandated and permissive reporters in the AVAA. It added new definitions for mandated and permissive reporters, repealed the AVAA’s old reporting provision, and added new reporting requirements for both mandated and permissive reporters. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=786%20P.2d%20265" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="786 P.2d 265">id.</a> </em>§§ 3 (adding definitions), 35 (repealing the AVAA’s original reporting provision, RCW 74.34.030), 5 (creating the new reporting requirements for mandated and permissive reporters). Again, the legislature’s silence with regard to civil causes of action against mandated reporters implies legislative acquiescence to a civil action against mandated reporters who fail to report abuse.</p>

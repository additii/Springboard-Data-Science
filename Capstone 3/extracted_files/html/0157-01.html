In cases of a sale to new customers the salesman would solicit the business of the customer and upon receiving the order he usually left with him a box of the particular brand of cigars sold until the order could be shipped and delivered, no money being paid however for the partial delivery, the whole amount being collected for the shipment after delivery thereof, in the regular course of business. No sales were made except to retail dealers.</p>

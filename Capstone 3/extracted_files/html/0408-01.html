We do not presume to set forth an authoritative historical treatise, but a brief discussion is needed to provide context for our analysis of the issue presented. This discussion reveals a centuries-old effort to balance the competing concerns where a juvenile is viewed as needing reformation and rehabilitation, but is not appropriately subjected to adult criminal proceedings and punishments. To balance these unique concerns, the law has constructed a constitutional wall around juveniles, maintaining its integrity through a continuous process of refining its contours and repairing its cracks.</p>
    <p id="b467-6" data-blocks='[["BL_467.6",467,[85,1338,1259,593]]]'>¶8 Within the English common law tradition, juvenile law did not begin to take shape until juveniles began to be viewed as a distinct class of individuals, rather than chattels incident to adult domestic relations or as simply members of the general population. Prior to the 1600s, juveniles were not viewed as having an identity separate from their parents until they were between five and seven years old. Thomas J. Bernard, The Cycle of Juvenile Justice 50-52 (1992). Between 1600 and 1800, the basic contours of the modern concept of juvenility solidified — the juvenile is a “potential adult” but not yet fully formed. <em>Id. </em>at 52, 54.</p>

In cases of orphaned juveniles with inherited estates, the Chancery Court would exercise equitable authority to manage both the person and the estate of the juvenile in the name of the sovereign. <em>Id. </em>at 69; <em>Weber v. Doust, </em><a href="/wash/84/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="84 Wash. 330" data-case-ids="598901" data-case-paths="/wash/84/0330-01">84 Wash. 330</a>, 333, <a href="/citations/?q=146%20P.%20623" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="146 P. 623">146 P. 623</a> (1915).

This authority was justified by the belief that “ ‘it is indispensably necessary to protect the persons and preserve the property of those who are unable to protect and take care of themselves.’ ” Julian W. Mack, <em>The Juvenile Court, </em><a href="/citations/?q=23%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20104" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="23 Harv. L. Rev. 104">23 Harv. L.

The age of the offender, however, was still a relevant factor in both law and fact. Under English common law, juveniles under 7 years old were legally incapable of committing a crime; there was a rebuttable presumption that those between 7 and 14 years old were not criminally responsible and a rebuttable presumption that those between 14 and 21 years old were. Bernard, <em>supra, </em>at 29 (citing 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries *23). Moreover, prosecutors, juries, and judges were sometimes reluctant to apply the letter of the law to juvenile offenders and sought to mitigate the harshness of adult criminal justice with charging, conviction, and sentencing decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 61; Anthony M. Platt, The Child Savers 186 (1969). The options were often extreme — either release the juvenile and risk the possibility that the juvenile will recidivate due to the lack of meaningful consequences, or confine the juvenile to the penitentiary with adult offenders and risk the possibility that the juvenile will be trained and encouraged to become an adult criminal due to the influence of fellow prisoners.

In an effort to separate juvenile offenders from the corrupting influence of adult criminals, some states provided that juveniles charged with crimes could be tried on a separate docket from adult criminal cases. Platt, <em>supra, </em>at 9. Some states also estab<a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>lished separate institutions for juveniles who were found to have violated the criminal laws or were expected to do so if not institutionalized and reformed, so the juvenile might be “snatched from a course which must have ended in confirmed depravity.” <em>Ex Parte Crouse, <a href="/whart/4/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="4 Whart. 9" data-case-ids="1835019" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0009-01">4 </a></em><a href="/whart/4/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="4 Whart. 9" data-case-ids="1835019" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0009-01">Whart. 9</a>, 11 (Pa. 1839); <em>see </em>Laws of 1891, ch. 103, §§ 1-2, at 195-96; <em>In re Habeas Corpus of Mason, </em><a href="/wash/3/0609-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="3 Wash. 609" data-case-ids="5297773" data-case-paths="/wash/3/0609-01">3 Wash. 609</a>, 612-13, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20P.%201025" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="28 P. 1025">28 P. 1025</a> (1892).

The 1913 laws solidified the distinction between a juvenile “dependent” and a juvenile “delinquent.” Laws of 1913, ch. 160, § 1. “Dependent” juveniles suffered from social, economic, and familial problems, while juveniles who violated state and local criminal laws were designated as “delinquents.” <em>Id. </em>The juvenile court judge had the discretion to transfer the case of a juvenile delinquent to the <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>ordinary criminal court. <em>Id. </em>§ 12.

However, even an author claiming “that rehabilitation of serious juvenile delinquents is more fiction than fact” recognizes that for rehabilitated former juvenile offenders, “the stigma of permanently wearing the label of juvenile delinquent” is not appropriate.

This court has always given effect to the legislature’s policy judgments in this particular arena, and Washington’s approach is supported by the experience of other states and Supreme Court jurisprudence, both historically and currently. It is also supported by the recommendations of professional organizations and even the views of commentators who do not believe in the juvenile court’s rehabilitative mission. We therefore conclude that juvenile court records that meet statutory sealing requirements have not historically been open to the press or the general public and that the experience prong is not met.</p>

Cqncerned with the nature of the allegations against the licensee, the trial court sealed the transcript. <em>Id. </em>at 388.

In so doing, it draws the very distinction we expressly rejected in <em>Chen, </em>178 Wn.2d at 356. The majority says that “there are plain distinctions between the openness of proceedings, which provide valuable public oversight, and the statutory sealing of records, which promote the rehabilitative purpose of the juvenile justice system.” Majority at 431. In contrast, in <em>Chen </em>we said that although the defendant “attempts to distinguish this case because it involved a courtroom proceeding and not a court record,... our jurisprudence has treated court records and court proceedings similarly.” 178 Wn.2d at 356.</p>

In <em>Sublett, </em>we said that we “consider the actual proceeding at issue for what it is, without having to force every situation into predefined factors.” 176 Wn.2d at 73. The majority reasons that this proposition permits the application of a lesser openness standard for records. However, we made the statement in <em>Sublett </em>to reject a bright-line distinction made by the Court of Appeals to determine when public trial rights attach and when they do not. We explained, “We decline to draw the line with legal and ministerial issues on one side, and the resolution of disputed facts and other adversarial proceedings on the other.” <em>Id. </em>at 72. We cannot, consistent with this reasoning, now draw a line with juvenile proceedings on one side and juvenile records on the other. Such an approach risks unraveling an entire body of law under our open courts jurisprudence. Instead, we must carefully consider the nature of the proceeding in question and whether it is entitled to article I, section 10 protections.</p>

In <em>Eikenberry, </em>the statute in question served a compelling interest in protecting child victims from further trauma and ensuring their constitutional right to privacy. Recognizing these goals, we nonetheless held that the statute was unconstitutional because it cut out the judiciary’s ability to protect individual rights through individualized sealing orders. The blanket rule in <em>D.F.F. </em>similarly failed because it prevented an individual’s ability to assert his or her constitutional right to open courts in a particular case. The majority’s holding would similarly prohibit courts from balancing individual constitutional rights when sealing juvenile records under former RCW 13.50.050. Such a holding is not demanded by the statute and not allowed by the constitution.</p>

Both experience and logic support the presumption of openness to juvenile court proceedings and records under article I, section 10. An <em>Ishikawa </em>analysis is therefore required prior to sealing juvenile court records. I would hold that former RCW 13.50.050(12) can be applied consistent with GR 15 and our constitutional mandate, and reverse and remand for the trial court to make an individualized determination in S.J.C.’s case.

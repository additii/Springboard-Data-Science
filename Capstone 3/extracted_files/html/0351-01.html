Witness testified that “a man by the name of Taylor took the deposit, and Medley was standing opposite him when he accepted it.” Objection was made to this answer, and counsel for <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>defendant asked that the answer be stricken ont, for the reason that it was not responsive to the charge in the indictment, and was a variance from the charge contained in the indictment.

A careful study of the two sections makes it apparent that the whole subject-matter to which the older statute relates is fully covered by the later statute. The first statute makes it unlawful for an insolvent bank to accept or receive deposits of the kind there named. The later statute, without naming the various kinds of deposits which might be made, makes it unlawful for an insolvent bank to receive any deposit, and, in addition thereto, makes it unlawful for such a bank to create any debt, and, after doing so, changes the punishment and makes the amended provision in regard to the punishment applicable alike to the receipt of deposits and the creation of debts. This being true, it must be held, in accordance with numerous decisions of this court, that, by implication, the earlier statute has been repealed. <em>Hampton </em>v.

A leading case on the subject is that of <em>Frese </em>v. <em>State, </em>2 Sou. 1. In that case it was contended that a statute of the State of Florida, which provided that a person convicted of selling intoxitíating liquors without license should be punished by a fine of not less than double the amount required for the license, but which did not prescribe a maximum fine, violated the provision of the Constitution of that State that “excessive fines shall not be imposed.” In the opinion in that case it was said: “The same provision against excessive fines is to be found in the English bill of rights, and we learn from Blackstone and other authorities that it was not necessary for a statute fixing the punishment of an offense by fine or imprisonment to do more than declare the general nature of the punishment, viz., by fine or imprisonment. The duration and quantity of each must, says' Blackstone, frequently vary from the aggravation, or otherwise, of the offense, the quality and condition of the parties, and from innumerable other circumstances, and ‘the guomtwm, in particular, of pecuniary fines neither can nor ought to be ascertained by an invariable law;’ and he says the -statute law has not often, and the common law never, ascertained the quantity of fines. The bill of rights (which, according to Blackstone, was only declaratory of the old constitutional law of England) restrained or regulated, by the provision referred to, the discretion of the judges in adjudging the quantity of the punishment.” It was there pointed out that, though it was custofnary in that State for either the maximum, or the minimum and the maximum of fine or <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>imprisonment with which an offense can be punished, to be declared by statute, yet there was no constitutional provision expressly providing that such limit or limits should be declared by statute, nor any provision, the effect of which was to make an omission by the legislative department to fix or prescribe a maximum punishment, fatal to a statute which prescribes only the minimum. The court then proceeded to say: “The mere failure to fix the maximum of a fine is not the imposition of an excessive fine. In the absence of a statutory declaration of a maximum, the courts are regulated or restrained by the same provision of the bill of rights that the citizen relies upon for protection against the infliction by them of excessive fines within the maximum, where such a maximum has been prescribed by statute. It cannot be denied that a fine imposed by a court upon a person may, upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case, be excessive, though within the maximum. Though such a statute may be clearly free from the charge of unconstitutionality, yet it might be that a judge, in fixing, or in approving or sustaining a fine fixed 'by a jury, would err in the <em>qucmtvm </em>of the fine inflicted. He may go too far above the minimum, where both a minimum and a maximum were specified, or too close to the maximum, where only a maximum was prescribed by the statute. In such case the citizen’s reliance for an enforcement of the provision of the bill of rights is upon the appellate courts, and upon the executive power to remit fines, commute punishment, and to grant pardons. This reliance is the same where the statute merely prescribes the minimum fine. The statute in question, when judged by the well-known rules governing in such cases, and which reauire that there must be a clear antagonism to some constitutional nrovision, violates no provision of our Constitution. While we deprecate such legislation, and deem it better, and more in accordance with well-established custom, that at least the maximum of any possible fine should be fixed by the Legislature, we <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>can find no authority that makes it necessary.

It is true that this is generally done, but when it is not done the power to impose a fine is limited by the constitutional provision that excessive fines shall not be imposed. The only case to which our attention has been directed in which the constitutionality of a statute fixing the minimum and not the maximum punishment has been considered, is <em>Frese </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla.) 2 Sou. 1. In a well-reasoned opinion the constitutionalitv of such a statute is maintained, and it is pointed out that the precise penalty is not usually fixed in a penal statute, but, where there is a constitutional provision that excessive fines shall not be imposed, the statute is to be read in connection with it, and such constitutional provision limits the power of the court which administers the law.”</p>

The Legislature therefore, in limiting <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>the trial court to four years as the minimum term, necessarily left it discretionary with the trial court to impose any reasonable term of imprisonment, not in violation of the constitutional provision which prohibits ‘cruel’ punishment.

Digest appears to have been copied <em>verbatim </em>from the Kansas statutes (Laws 1891, ch. 43, §16), and before the enactment of our statute the Supreme Court of that State had construed their <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>statute. In the ease in which this was done, it was charged that the accused (the president of a bank) had received and accepted the deposit, while there, as here, there was no testimony showing that the accused had done so, or was present standing by, aiding or abetting the receipt and acceptance of the deposit. The Supreme Court of Kansas held that the testimony' did not support the allegations of the indictment, and in so holding said: “It must be borne in mind that the Baxter Bank was a corporation. The connection of the appellant with it was that of an officer. He is not charged with being the owner. The other persons connected with the bank were its officers and employees. Possibly a private banker, who employed clerks and servants to receive deposits, might be bound, even in a criminal case, by their acts, where their possession immediately became his; but the statute, as framed, seems to denounce its' penalties against the individual who shall take deposits -into the bank when he knows it to be insolvent, and also against all others who knowingly permit’ or connive at their reception (Citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Wells, </em><a href="/citations/?q=35%20S.W.%20615" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="35 S.W. 615">35 S. W. 615</a>). Whether the evidence given at the trial in this case was sufficient to uphold a charge against the defendant of having permitted or connived at the receipt of the deposits, we need not decide. The charge is that he accepted and received. The word ‘accepted’ implies that the bank received, and that he agreed and assented to the reception. He could not accept without at least knowing what was received. The proof being insufficient to sustain the conviction under these counts of the information, the motion for a new trial should have been sustained. The judgment is reversed.

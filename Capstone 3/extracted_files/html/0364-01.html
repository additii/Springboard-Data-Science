Darcus Dewayne Allen, the petitioner in this case, drove Clemmons to and from the crime scene and was charged as an accomplice. We must decide whether the prosecuting attorney committed prejudicial misconduct by misstating the standard upon which the jury may convict an accomplice. In a divided decision, the Court of Appeals recognized that the statements were improper but ultimately held that they did not amount to prejudicial misconduct. <em>State v.

Specifically, he announced that if the police arrived to look for him, he would kill them and then go across the street to the elementary school and commit further acts of violence. Clemmons brandished a handgun while he described these acts. Allen, who was a friend and employee of Clemmons, was present at that dinner.</p>

With Allen driving, Clemmons directed him to a car wash near a coffee shop in Lakewood. Upon arriving at the car wash, Allen parked the truck, got out, and walked across the street to a minimart. During that time, Clemmons also left the car wash and entered the coffee shop, where the shootings occurred. When Allen returned to the truck, Clemmons appeared and told Allen that they had to leave. Allen claimed he drove only a few blocks until he left the truck upon discovering Clemmons was wounded. Allen also claimed that he did not know Clemmons was going to commit the murders.</p>

This question indicates that the jury was unsure whether it could convict Allen using the incorrect “should have known” standard. <em>See Davenport, </em>100 Wn.2d at 765 (reversing conviction where, among other factors, the record revealed “that the jury was influenced, if not misled, by the prosecutor’s comment”).

G. Pagan <em>et al., </em>in the Union Chancery Court. The plaintiff alleges that it is the owner and entitled to the southeast quarter of the southeast quarter of section 3, township 18 south, range 13 west, Union County, Arkansas, and it deraigns title from the United States Government to the State of Arkansas, and from the State, through mesne conveyances, to the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleges that the land had at all times been uninclosed and unimproved, and that it and those under whom it holds had paid the taxes regularly and consecutively for each year since 1905. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were asserting title under a donation deed from the State to Mary McHenry, dated April 12, 1921. The plaintiff alleged that one of the defendants, W. G. Pagan, ivas engaged in cutting timber on the land; that Pagan was insolvent, and that, unless restrained, he would continue to cut the timber, to the <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>great damage of plaintiff. Plaintiff alleged that it had no adequate remedy iat law, and prayed that Pagan be restrained from cutting the timber, and for damages in the sum of $1Q0 for the timber already cut, and that plaintiff’s title be quieted against the defendants, and that all deeds under which defendants claimed be canceled.</p>
    <p id="b576-3" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[279,690,1206,751]]]'>The defendants answered, denying .all material allegations of the complaint, and set up that, on June 4, 1885, Mary McHenry, obtained a donation deed from the State of Arkansas to the land mentioned in the complaint, and that she took immediate possession of the land and improved a part thereof, and had continued in the possession thereof until the present time, openly, peaceably, and adversely to all the world. It was also alleged that Pagan and his immediate predecessors in title were solvent, and that they had been damaged by the action of the plaintiff in having a restraining order issued, in the mm. of $500. Defendants prayed for dissolution of the restraining order and for judgment against the plaintiff in the sum of $500, and that the record title in the plaintiff be canceled.</p>

The court entered a decree dismissing the plaintiff’s complaint for want of equity, and quieting title to the lands in the defendants as against the plaintiff, and dis-' missing the defendants’ prayer for damages against the plaintiff.

The land was granted to and selected by the State under act of Con-' gress approved September 4, 1841. The record of deeds shows that the. State deeded the land to J. D. Hostetter, January 22,1904, and by him, through mesne conveyances ' by warranty deed to various parties, the land was con<a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>veyed to the appellant on January 22, 1906. True, there was introduced in evidence at the trial .of this cause a duplicate donation deed, showing that the lands were deeded by the Commissioner .of State Lands to Mary McHenry, on June 4, 1885, which deed recited that the lands were forfeited to the State for the nonpayment of taxes for the year 1878. But it appears from the record of deeds in evidence that, at the time of this alleged forfeiture, the title to the land was still in the State of Arkansas. The first evidence of any conveyance from the State was. the patent to J. D. Hostetter on January '27, 1904.</p>

The next question is, did Mary McHenry and those claiming title under her to the land in controversy acquire title thereto by adverse possession thereof under the seven-year statute of limitations!? A decided preponderance of the evidence — indeed, practically the undisputed testimony — shows that the tract of land in controversy is unimproved and uninclosed. This forty-acre tract is in section 3, township 18 south, range 13 west; it was embraced in the donation deed to Mary McHenry, together with the south one-half of the southwest quarter of section 2, being eighty acres, in the same township and range. It is stipulated by the parties to the record that the taxes on the lands in controversy have been paid by the appellant each and every year since 1905, with the exception of the year 1923. The lands in controversy being unimproved and uninclosed, the appellant acquired title thereto by such payment of taxes. <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>Section 6934, C. &amp; M.

But the decision and opinion in that case, as we construe it, has no application to the facts of this record. The decision in that case, as shown fejr the pleadings and testimony adduced by the respective parties, turned upon the issue as to whether or not the plaintiffs in that case acquired title by adverse possession to the eighty acres of land under the seven-year statute of limitations. The plaintiffs in that case claimed, and proved to the satisfaction of the jury, that they entered into possession of a part of the eighty-acre tract of. land in controversy under the donation deed to Mary McHenry, and had occupied and improved the same, and continuously held open, exclusive and adverse possession- thereof for a period of more than seven years, Avhich gave them title to the entire eighty ¡acres. But there was no allegation in that case, and no proof that defendants had paid the taxes on the land consecutively and continuously for seven years, and that the lands in controversy in that case were uninclosed and unimproved. That issue was not raised. In that case we held that the donation deed to Mary McHenry was color of title for' the purpose of marking the boundaries of the lands claimed and occupied by her and her heirs. The jury found, upon sufficient proof, as we have stated, that a part of the land in controversy had been in adverse possession of the <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>plaintiffs (appellees in that case) for a period of seven years. But in the case at bar, as we have seen, no part of the land in controversy had been actually occupied by the appellees. On the contrary, the entire tract of forty acres in controversy ivas unimproved and uninclosed land, to Avhich the appellant had acquired legal title by deeds of record, and also on AAThich the appellant had paid the taxes continuously each year for more than seven years.</p>

The doctrine of these cases has no application here, because of the difference in the facts. The appellees here, with only color of title, seek to acquire title by constructive adverse possession against the true OAATier of uninclosed and unimproved lands, who has continuously paid the taxes thereon each year since the time of his purchase thereof for more than seven years. The doctrine applicable here is that the true owner of aatM and unimproved lands, Avho has continuously paid taxes thereon from the time he acquired title thereto and for more than seven years in succession, cannot be defeated of his title and right to the actual possession olhis lands by one who merely claims title thereto under color of title and by only a constructive adverse possession.

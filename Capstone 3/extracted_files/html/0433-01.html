Subsequent thereto, being indebted to appellee bank, he executed a mortgage on the same lands to it, subject to the first mortgages, to secure it therefor. All of these debts remaining unpaid, appellants brought their several suits on March 2, 1929, for judgment on their debt and for foreclosure of the mortgage securing them. A decree was rendered in this suit on March 30, 1929, and on May 3d, following, the lands were sold by virtue of the decree and purchased by the appellee for the debts and interest named in the decree and the costs that had accrued.

By act of the General Assembly of 1883, at page 199 of the acts' of that year, digested in § 10056 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, provision is made that “when any real estate shall be sold at judicial sale, * * * the court shall order the taxes and penalties and interest thereon against such lands to be discharged out of. the proceeds of such sale.” This court, in the case of <em>Miners’ Bank </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em><a href="/ark/156/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="156 Ark. 191" data-case-ids="1358470" data-case-paths="/ark/156/0191-01">156 Ark. 191</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=245%20S.W.%20829" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="245 S.W. 829">245 S. W. 829</a>, construed this language to apply to all judicial sales. In that case the question under consideration was whether, under a sale to foreclose a mortgage on real estate, the taxes which had fallen due prior to the date of the sale could ¡be treated as an incumbrance on the land to be borne by the purchaser, or whether it should be paid out of the proceeds of the sale. We there said: “Our statute provides that a lien for taxes as between grantor and grantee shall attach on the first Monday in January of <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>each year. Crawford &amp; Moses ’ Digest, § 10023. At the time of the sale there was then unpaid taxes due on the land which constituted a lien in favor of the State and county. It was well established at common law that the rule of <em>caveat emptor </em>applied to purchasers at judicial sales, and that the purchaser took the land subject to all incumbrances existing at that time, including tax liens. This rule was changed as to tax liens, however, by statute which is a part of the general revenue laws enacted by the General Assembly of 1883. * * * The question suggests itself as to when, under the statute, the order of the court must be made, whether at the time of the decree or later, before the fund is paid out by the commissioner. We think that the statute itself declares that the tax shall be paid out of the proceeds of the sale, and it is not essential that the original decree directing foreclosure shall contain a direction for such payment, but the court may direct the payment at any time before the fund is disbursed.”</p>
    <p id="b456-3" data-blocks='[["BL_456.4",456,[306,1358,1198,982]],["BL_457.1",457,[182,362,1196,257]]]'>In the case at bar the taxes were due at the time of the institution of the suit and at the date of the decree of foreclosure, and therefore the court might have ordered these paid out of the purchase money. It may be argued that, as the taxes were not included in the judgment of the court, and were paid by appellant to protect the land after the date of the decree of foreclosure and before the sale, the statute would not apply. But this is not so. The appellants might well have discharged the liens at any time before the final decree and secured their reimbursement by amendment to their complaints, and, having failed to do this, might have appeared on the day of sale and themselves bid an amount sufficient to cover the sum named in the decree together with the taxes they had paid. They could not, however, avoid the effect of the statute by neglecting to do this and, after confirmation of the sale and the execution of the commissioner’s deed, enforce the payment by the method undertaken. This is especially true when the proceeds <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>of the sale are paid to them, since the court might have made the order for the payment of the taxes out of the purchase money at any time before the fund was distributed, and since they, themselves, have received it, they are in no attitude to complain.</p>

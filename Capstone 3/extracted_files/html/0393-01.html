For many years, the only pension benefit option available included a survivor benefit for a spouse who outlived the retiree that was usually equal to 50 percent of the retiree’s monthly benefit. In 2000, the Department of Retirement Systems (DRS) created a new option under which the retiree could opt for a pension that would allow a surviving spouse to continue to receive monthly pension benefits at the same amount after the retiree’s death. To make this pension actuarially equivalent in value to the previous pension, the DRS provided for a greater reduction in the retiree’s monthly benefits. In 2010, the DRS adopted rules that modified the degree of the actuarial reduction. Appellant Tim Lenander challenges the changes to the reduction, arguing that it violates the statutory scheme and impairs <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>his contract right to a lower reduction in his pension payment.</p>
    <p id="b437-4" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[202,469,1252,644]]]'>¶2 We reject Lenander’s arguments. The plain language of the Washington State Patrol Retirement System (WSPRS) “Plan 1” survivor benefit statute, read in the context of its overall statutory scheme, grants authority to the DRS to adopt rules establishing an actuarially equivalent survivor option, and broad authority to adopt and revise actuarial factors for purposes of administering the state’s public retirement systems. We therefore hold that the DRS acted within its statutory authority. Additionally, the DRS did not violate the contract clause of article I, section 23 of the Washington Constitution. The decision of the Thurston County Superior Court is affirmed.</p>

The statutory definition of “actuarial equivalent” requires a benefit be of “equal value” based on a mortality rate and interest rate selected by the DRS. RCW 43.43.120(1). This language indicates these two factors are relevant to the calculation of “equal value” but says nothing about when or how the DRS may make changes to these factors. To the extent Lenander’s argument suggests there must be a demonstrable change in these rates in order to make adjustments to the actuarial equivalency calculation, we reject his arguments. The plain text of the statutes say <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>nothing about requiring a demonstrable change in the interest rate or mortality rate as a prerequisite to the adoption of new actuarial factors, and we will not read such additional language into the statute.

The statutory scheme for the collection and application of actuarial valuations for WSPRS has undergone significant changes since the definition of “actuarial equivalent” was added to the statute in 1951. In 1989, when the legislature granted the DRS authority to periodically adopt actuarial factors and regulations as <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>necessary, it announced its intent was “to provide a dependable and systematic process for funding the benefits provided to members” of WSPRS. Laws of 1989, ch. 273, § 1 (codified at RCW 41.45.010). To address the problem of unfunded liabilities in the state retirement systems, this legislation enacted employer contribution rates for the state retirement systems (including WSPRS) to ensure the full funding of future pension benefits. S.B. Rep. on Substitute S.B. 5418, 51st Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 1989). At the same time, the legislature took note of the role that accurate actuarial valuations—which assess the system’s future liabilities—will play in determining the rate of contributions necessary to ensure full funding for the benefits paid out. <em>Id. </em>This legislative purpose is best effectuated by an interpretation that allows the DRS to utilize a range of relevant actuarial factors to come to the most accurate calculation of actuarial equivalence and thereby ensures the DRS pays out benefits accurately. Such a reading will ensure that the benefits paid out to retirees do not exceed their actual value and threaten the integrity of the system’s funding.</p>

This interpretation gives effect to all language used by the legislature and is consistent with the legislative intent to create a retirement system that is more actuarially sound. Based on this interpretation, we hold that the DRS properly relied on recommendations from the state actuary in updating the Option B actuarial factors, and that the 2010 changes to WAC 415-103-215 and WAC 415-02-380 were valid.</p>

We find no evidence that this interpretation is either harmful or incorrect. Accordingly, we reject the reasoning of the Alaska Supreme Court in <em>Sheffield.</em>

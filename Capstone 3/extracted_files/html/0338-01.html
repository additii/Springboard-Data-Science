We do not think the testimony of the engineer and fireman necessarily rebuts the presumption of negligence arising out of the act of killing the dog. Neither of them saw the dog killed or venture any explanation of how it was killed. Both the engineer and fireman testified that the statutory signals for the crossing were given, but in this respect they were contradicted by W. P. and W. A. Daniels, who testified that they observed the passing train, and are certain the whistle was not blown. Physi<a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>cal facts show that the dog was struck on the tracks north of the public road and dragged across the public road and along the railroad track for twenty feet in the direction the train was going. Blood was found in the public road and on the railroad track, and the entrails of the dog were strewn across the public road and along the railroad track for twenty feet in the direction of the dog’s body. According to the testimony of the engineer, the dog was running along the side of the engine, barking at the cylinders, when the engine crossed the public road. The jury therefore may have concluded that the testimony of the engineer was untrue, as being in conflict with the physical facts; that he had not given the statutory signals as claimed, being contradicted in that respect by the Daniels; that he and the fireman failed to keep the proper lookout, on the theory that, if they had done so, they could have seen the dog which was killed on the track in time to have prevented the injury by giving stock alarms, which, all agree, were not given. The theory is advanced by learned connsel that, after the engine passed, the dog ran under one of the cars or was struck by a journal box, step, or some part of the car, and was thrown under the train. In fact, it is contended that this is the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence. The record reflects that the body of the dog was between the rails, and the head outside of the rails when discovered. This physical fact is in conflict with the theory advanced. If the head was severed from the body while running between the wheels onto the track, the head would, in all probability, have been found between the rails and the body on the outside. It cannot be said that the jury arbitrarily discarded the testimony of the engineer by refusing to accept the theory advanced by counsel. We think the appellant has failed to meet the burden of proof cast upon it by the statute, and that the verdict and judgment are supported by substantial evidence.</p>

Her recorded statutory warranty deed indicated the property was subject to Barclay Court’s Declaration and Amendment No. 1. At some point, Bilanko decided she wanted to lease her unit. Unfortunately, seven units were already being leased at the time. In March 2013, Bilanko asked to be put on the leasing waiting list. She was number five on the waiting list. In September 2013, Bilanko requested a hardship waiver under section 9.2.6.5 of the amendment to allow her to lease her unit. Barclay Court denied Bilanko’s request. Bilanko persisted. She notified Barclay Court in October 2013 that she intended to lease her unit beginning in November and would sue unless Barclay Court revised Amendment No. 1. Counsel for Barclay Court responded that Bilanko would violate the Declaration if she leased out her unit and that Barclay Court had the right to evict any unauthorized tenants.</p>

CP at 1-7. Barclay Court moved for partial summary <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>judgment, arguing that Bilanko’s action was barred by the one-year statute of limitations under RCW 64.34.264(2) and an identical one-year limit in the Declaration. Bilanko moved for declaratory relief, arguing that the amendment was not correctly adopted, that it was void ab initio, and that her challenge was not barred by the statute of limitations. The trial court judge initially granted Barclay Court’s motion and denied Bilanko’s. It found that although Bilanko would have prevailed on the merits had she filed a timely challenge, the statute of limitations under RCW 64.34.264(2) barred her claim.

Accordingly, the amendment is not void ab initio. Barclay Court followed the procedures set out in article 25 of its Declaration: a majority of the board of directors voted to submit the amendment for owner approval, all owners were notified of the proposed amendment in writing, and at least 67 percent of the owners approved the amendment. Barclay Court acted within the statutory authority it has under RCW 64.34.264(5) to prepare, execute, record, and certify the amendment. Nothing in RCW 64.34.264 suggests that the legislature intended to make amendments not passed with the required supermajority void and subject to challenge at any time. It strains credulity to believe that it would not make such a draconian consequence explicit in the statute.</p>

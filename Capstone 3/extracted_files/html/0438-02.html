Com., </em>141.) As defined by Bishop, it is “ the corrupt demanding or receiving, by a person in office, of afee for services which should be performed gratuitously ; or, where compensation is permissible,of a larger fee than the law justifies, or afee not due.” <em>(2 Bish. Crim. Law, sec. 390.) </em>The latter author says: “No act, carefully performed, from motives which the law recognizes as honest and upright,ispunishable as a crime. Audit has always been held that extortion proceeds from a corrupt mind.” <em>(Ib., 396.) </em>And Wharton says that, “ both by statute and at common law, it is necessary that the taking should be willful and corrupt.” <em>3 Wharton Crim. </em>Law, <em>2509.</em>

The State, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Vroom%20125" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Vroom 125">7 Vroom, 125</a>, </em>say: “On the part of the state, it is argued that this statute is explicit in its terms, and makes the mere taking of an . illegal fee a criminal act, without regard to the intent of the recipient. Such undoubtedly is the literal force of the language, but then, on the same principle, the officer would be guilty if he took, by mis<a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>take or inadvertence, more than the sum coming to him. Nor would the statutory terms, if taken in their exact signification, exclude from their compass an officer who might he laboring under an insane delusion. Manifestly, therefore, the terms of this section are subject to certain practical limitations. This is the case with most statutes couched in comprehensive terms, and especially with those which modify or otherwise regulate common law offenses. In such instances the old and new law are to be construed together; and the former will not be considered to be abolished except so far as the design to produce such effect appears to be clear. In morals, it is an evil mind which makes the offense, and this, as a general rule has been at the root of the criminal law. The consequence is that it is not to be intended that this principle is discarded merely on account of the generality of statutory language. It is highly reasonable to presume that the lawmakers did not intend to disgrace or to punish a person who should do an act under the belief that it was lawful to do it.”</p>

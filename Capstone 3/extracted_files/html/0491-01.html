As a further defense, it was alleged that the appellee had entered into a written contract with the appellant, whereby it was agreed that, in the event of any injury occurring during the course of his employment, compensation should be made under the provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation'Act of the State of Louisiana. This contract was pleaded as a complete defense to the action, to which a special demurrer was interposed, and sustained over the objections of appellant.

Without discussing this evidence in detail, suffice it to say that viewed in its most favorable light it tended to establish the fact that, before the date of the alleged injury, the appellee was a healthy man, and had never had any disease of the skin; that he had been in the employ <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>of oil companies for a number of years engaged in doing general work in the oil fields, which included that of fitting pipes and carpenter work, but that he had never had occasion to work where the conditions were similar to those 'which existed at the pumping station on the date of his injury, and that he did not know that chemicals from refining plants were likely to pollute the water within the pumping station. There was evidence also to the effect that the appellant’s foreman knew of refining plants situated a short distance above this pumping station, and that ordinarily the waste from the same would drain through a depression, but that he also knew that about the time of the injury complained of there had been a good deal of complaint of oil poisoning, and that the waters from the depression through which the waste would usually flow spread out over the territory nearby, and over the pumping station; that the appellee was directed to work in the station and to bale out the accumulation of water and sediment therein, and was assured there was no danger in doing this; that he was engaged in this work for perhaps two days; that within a short time after completing this work his hand and arm began to itch 'and burn, and in about two or three weeks broke out in small pustules, the infection continuing to spread and increase in intensity until it became such that he made complaint, and was directed to go to a physician who diagnosed his trouble as oil poisoning.</p>

Several employees of the appellant, who worked in the station with the appellee, also contracted oil poisoning, while others did not. There is no evidence to show that, between the time of the baling operations and the discovery of the irritation on the hand and arm of the appellee, he worked at any place where he would have been likely to contract oil poisoning, but <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>that for a time after the date of his alleged injury he worked around the station doing odd jobs, such as cutting grass, fitting pipes, etc., from which there was nothing likely to create the condition to his skin. This evidence is legally sufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury, both on the question of negligence on the part of the appellant, and the lack of contributory negligence of the appellee, and warrants the submission to the jury of the question of assumption- of risk.</p>

To the defense that appellee was precluded from a recovery because of the contract entered into between him and the appellant -by which any injury was to be compensated in the manner and in the amounts fixed by the Workmen’s Compensation Act of Louisiana, the appellee interposed a special demurrer which was sustained hy the court. This ruling, it is strongly insisted, was erroneous on the theory that the contract was a voluntary mutual agreement, fair in its provisions, and which in no way attempted to limit the liability for the injury, and therefore was not against the policy of this State as expressed by the Constitution and § 7147 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, and that to construe the statute last cited as prohibiting the appellant from making a contract of the nature pleaded would be unconstitutional as denying it equal protection of the law, and that it denies <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>freedom of contract and conflicts with the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>

We have many times upheld the validity of acts relating to corporations, limiting their rights beyond those of natural persons for the reason that a citizen or natural person has the inherent right, independent of any legislation, to contract, while the corporation is clothed only with such power as may be given it by the legislative will, and this may be altered, revoked, or annulled at the pleasure of the Legislature, and terms prescribed under which they may conduct their business, the only limitation upon its power being that it may not interfere with any vested right of the corporation or its incorporators, or violate any fundamental principle of natural justice.

Is it not simply the obligation to respond in damages, and is not an attempt to exempt the master from his obligation to so respond, an attempt to exempt him from a portion of his liability?” The answer to the question is obvious. When the remedy is lessened, the liability to that extent is destroyed.</p>

Article 2, § 7, of our Constitution preserves in all cases triable in a court of law the right to a trial by jury, without regard to the amount in controversy. No declaration of a settled policy could be clearer than the language there used, and any shift to thwart or nullify the fundamental law cannot be upheld. It is apparent, whatever the argument may be, that the making of the contract was not the voluntary act of the appellee. The practical interpretation of the contract is, no contract, no job. By the contract, an employee’s remedy for injury suffered for a negligent act of the employer, while not wholly taken away, is seriously impaired; first, as has been observed, by the necessity of his having to resort to a foreign forum, and, second, by limitation of the amount to be recovered in a sum in many cases which might well be supposed little short of a complete denial of redress. Without regard to the culpability of the employer, the age of the employee, the number of his dependents, or the reasonable expectation of greatly increased earning <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>power, or of the length of time he may be expected to live, yet, if totally and permanently disabled, his compensation is limited to 65 per cent, of the wages he was earning at the very time of the injury, and can in no event continue beyond a period of 400 weeks, or seven and one-seventh years. This is an arbitrary fixing of compensation, which, in many instances, would be so much less than the damages to which the employee is justly entitled as to amount to a denial of liability. Our Constitution, by § 32, art. 5, has asserted as basic law, and as further declaratory of our settled policy, that “no act of the General Assembly shall limit the amount to be recovered for injuries resulting in death or injuries to persons or property”; and by § 6 of art. 12, power is reserved to alter or amend any general laws existing at the time corporations are formed; by § 11, art. 12, foreign corporations are authorized to transact business in this State under such limitations and restrictions as may be prescribed by law. Those limitations and restrictions (§ 1828, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest) are such as are imposed by law upon domestic corporations. If, then, the General Assembly could not limit the amount to be recovered for personal injuries received, it follows that a creature which owes its existence to a legal birth and operates within the State by its permission, under legal restrictions, may not do that which the law-making body itself cannot do. To leave no doubt regarding the policy of this State, the General Assembly, by act No. 175, <em>supra, </em>of which §§ 7144 and 7147 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest are a part, provided for liability for injury suffered by an employee of any corporation except those engaged in-interstate commerce. The exception was made because corporations of the last-named class, with respect to liability for injuries to its employees, was fixed by the Federal Employers’ Liability Act. Section 4 -of act No. 175 (now § 7147, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest) provides that any contract, etc., seeking to exempt corporations from any liability imposed should be to that extent void. The- contract, then, being, as we hold, a shift to evade the laws of this State, and in conflict with public policy, the <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>court correctly sustained the demurrer.to that part of appellant’s answer which pleaded said contract as a defense to plaintiff’s suit. <em>Little Rock, etc., Ry. </em>v. <em>Eubanks, </em>and <em>Leep </em>v. <em>Ry.

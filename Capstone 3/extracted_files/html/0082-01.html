E. Ottinger to teash a common school in said district for the term of seven months, commencing on the 5th day of July, 1920, and agreed to pay him therefor the sum of $125 for each school month. After Ottinger had taught the school for five months, the directors discharged him and refused to let him teach the remaining two months. Ottinger asked the directors upon what grounds they discharged him, and they refused to tell him. They told him that if he brought suit for the balance alleged to be due him, they would give their reasons for his discharge in defending the suit.</p>

    <p id="b106-5" data-blocks='[["BL_106.6",106,[288,955,1198,242]]]'>The law applicable to cases of this sort was well stated by Judge Hemingway in <em>School District </em>v. <em>Maury, </em><a href="/ark/53/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="53 Ark. 471" data-case-ids="1911630" data-case-paths="/ark/53/0471-01">53 Ark., 471</a>. In discussing a contract made by a school teacher with directors to teach a school, the learned justice said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b106-6" data-blocks='[["BL_106.7",106,[280,1217,1204,964]]]'>“If the defect arises from the failure of the teacher to carry out his undertakings, the keeping of the school in the way that the law contemplates demands that he be required to comply with his contract. This contract necessarily implies that he is competent to teach properly, and that he will conduct himself in a moral and skilful manner in discharging his undertakings. If he cannot or will not do either, he violates the contract, and its termination comes through his breach. We do not mean to say that every act of immorality would be a breach of the contract to justify its termination; but it would be such whenever, from the character or notoriety of the act, it impaired the services of the teacher in properly instructing or advancing the pupils. A teacher might properly instruct, yet his character for morality be so notoriously bad that he would lose the respect of his pupils and fail to advance them. He would not then be a competent teacher, though there were no defects in his'learning or facility to impart it.”</blockquote>

He stated further that he always cleaned the schoolhouse as soon as possible after finding it in this condition. His testimony in this respect is uncoiitradicted.</p>

Conceding that he did spit tobacco juice through the screen windows on the several occasions testified to by some of the pupils, we do not think that •his conduct in this respect was sufficient ground for his discharge. He had been employed by the school district to teach two schools prior to the execution of the contract in question, and his personal habits were well known. Besides, we do not think that this conduct would justify his discharge in the application of the rule above announced.. It might be a good reason for not employing him in the first instance, but it would not be a sufficient ground for his discharge after he had been employed.</p>

The court based its decision on “principles of due process and equal protection” and on “potential implications of double jeopardy.” <em>Id. </em>at 347. It reasoned that a contrary decision would result in two separate sets of sentencing ranges — one for “those unable to procure pretrial release from confinement and another for those fortunate enough to obtain such release” — and concluded that such a sentencing regime would not survive rational basis review. <em>Id. </em>at 346-47. The <em>Reanier </em>decision was applied to total confinement: “We conclude that considerations of due process, equal protection and the prohibition against multiple punishments dictate that presentence jail time be credited against maximum and mandatory minimum terms where applicable.” <em>Id. </em>at 352-53.</p>

If the legislature wants to credit pretrial time that does not amount to confinement— like the CCAP time at issue here — for nonviolent offenders, but not for violent offenders, it may do so under <em>Harris. </em>This distinction is rational.</p>

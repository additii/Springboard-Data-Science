RCW 9.94A-.525(4) (scoring anticipatory offenses as completed offenses), (9) (assigning three points for any serious violent offense), .030(45) (defining “serious violent offense”).

But whether the failure of a court or jury to find the absence of self-defense in convicting a defendant on a foreign offense renders that conviction categorically not comparable to a Washington offense is not a question we must consider in this case. Here, the documents from the Texas conviction (which the State filed with the Washington court at sentencing) show that the Texas jury was instructed on self-defense and told that the State had the burden to disprove it. CP at 55. And, the jury convicted Jordan anyway. CP at 56.

Consider the possible nuances of self-defense. Unlike Washington, some 19 states still impose a common-law duty to retreat as a condition of claiming self-defense outside the home. <em>See </em>Eugene Volokh, <em>Duty to Retreat and Stand Your Ground: Counting the States, </em>The Volokh Conspiracy (July 17, 2013, 10:11 AM), http://www.volokh.com/2013/07/ 17/duty-to-retreat/.

If the SRA required courts to compare self-defense laws from foreign states for exact equality, many otherwise comparable convictions for serious violent offenses would go uncounted, notwithstanding that the legislature “obviously intended out-of-state convictions to be considered” as part of a defendant’s offender score. <em>Morley, </em>134 Wn.2d at 597-98.</p>

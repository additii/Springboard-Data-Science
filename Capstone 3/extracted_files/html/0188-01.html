Mendes challenges his conviction for felony murder based on allegations that he shot and killed Danny Saylor after an altercation at Saylor’s home. At trial, Mendes’s theory of the case was that he acted in self-defense after Saylor came at him with a baseball bat. After the State rested, Mendes’s counsel asked the court to make a preliminary ruling on whether enough evidence had been presented through the State’s witnesses to warrant a self-defense instruction. Counsel explained that Mendes did not wish to testify unless the court found that more testimony was necessary on this issue. The State objected, and the trial court declined to rule on Mendes’s request. Mendes then testified on his own behalf. Mendes was convicted of felony murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On appeal, Mendes argued that the trial court improperly compelled him to testify when it declined to rule on whether the State’s evidence alone entitled him to a self-defense instruction. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument and held that Mendes was not entitled to an advisory ruling on jury instructions before the close of all the evidence and that Mendes’s decision to testify was voluntary and tactical.

Even though Saylor and Pal<a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>omo were back together, Mendes occasionally came to Saylor’s house to see Palomo.

Charles Bollinger, one of three houseguests of Saylor’s, met Mendes at the front door. Bollinger advised Mendes that he should not be at the home. Bollinger and Mendes went to a gas station and then returned to the home. During their trip to the gas station, Mendes showed Bollinger the gun. Upon returning to the house, Bollinger woke Saylor to inform him that Mendes was in the house. McKay Brown, another houseguest, advised Mendes to leave, but he did not leave.</p>

After the State’s case in chief, Mendes asked the trial court whether he would be entitled to a self-defense instruction based on the State’s evidence alone. The trial court declined to decide the motion until both sides rested. Mendes testified but told the court that his testimony would be given over his standing objection and that his decision to testify was based on the court’s ruling. The jury convicted Mendes of second degree felony murder, the firearm enhancement, and four counts of witness tampering. Mendes was sentenced to 517 months. Mendes appealed the felony murder conviction. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We granted review only on the issue of compelled testimony. <em>State v.

Knapstad, </em><a href="/wash-2d/107/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="107 Wash. 2d 346" data-case-ids="1192451" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/107/0346-01">107 Wn.2d 346</a>, 356-57, <a href="/citations/?q=729%20P.2d%2048" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="729 P.2d 48">729 P.2d 48</a> (1986). We find Mendes’s reliance on <em>Knapstad </em>misplaced. While it is true that the trial court may rule on the sufficiency of the evidence at the end of the State’s case in chief, the rule in <em>Knapstad </em>is consistent with CrR 8.3(b). CrR 8.3(b) provides in relevant part that “[t]he court, in the furtherance of justice, after notice and hearing, may dismiss any criminal prosecution due to arbitrary action or governmental misconduct.” There is no equivalent rule requiring a trial court to decide if a defendant is entitled to a self-defense instruction at the close of the State’s case. As mentioned above, <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>CrR 6.15 is the only rule regarding jury instructions in criminal cases and it is silent on the issue.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

CrR 6.15(a) contemplates that jury instructions be submitted before trial and that the jury instructions could be settled before trial. The rule also contemplates that jury instructions can be submitted and discussed during the presentation of evidence or even during jury deliberations. We note that “it is error to give an instruction which is not supported by the evidence.” <em>State v.

In other words, the defendant argued that he would not have testified had he known that the jury was going to be instructed on the charge of negligent assault. We rejected this argument and held that there was no evidence of compulsion to testify, “rather, the record reflects that the defendant voluntarily testified in seeking to exculpate himself.” <em>Id. </em>at 473.

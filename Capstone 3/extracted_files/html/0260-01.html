In December 2013, Rainier House staff informed a King County designated mental health professional (DMHP) that W.C.C. exhibited concerning behavior. W.C.C. had hit another Rainier House resident in the throat. He had previously threatened to kill the resident and had falsely accused him of having sexual relations with a Rainier House clinical support specialist.

W.C.C.’s objection to his 14-day commitment hinges on reading the exclusion of weekends and holidays in RCW 71.05.180 to imply the inclusion of such days in computing time under RCW 71.05.240(1). Although his argument makes a logical appeal to the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, it is less compelling in light of the unique legislative history of the two provisions in chapter 71.05 RCW. When the legislature first enacted RCW 71.05.180 in 1973, weekends and holidays were expressly counted in the initial 72-hour period. Laws of 1973,1st Ex. Sess., ch. 142, § 23. A 1974 amendment eliminated Sundays and holidays, Laws of 1974, Ex. Sess., ch. 145, § 11, and a 1979 amendment also eliminated Saturdays, Laws of 1979, Ex. Sess., ch. 215, § 11. Thus, the express language in RCW 71.05.180 excluding weekends and holidays from the computation of the 72- hour period is specific to that provision and should not be read as stating an “exception” to otherwise applicable general rules for computing time for court hearings.</p>

Given both the weekend and the December 25 holiday, W.C.C.’s probable cause hearing should <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>have been held on or before December 26 in the absence of the allowed continuances. W.C.C.’s counsel requested on December 24 a continuance until Friday, December 27 (this continuance totaled more than 48 hours). The State then requested on December 27 a continuance until December 30 (this continuance totaled more than 24 hours). Thus, whether these continuances were permissible under RCW 71.05.240(1) hinges on whether weekends and holidays are excluded from the time period computation.</p>

      <p id="b319-7" data-blocks='[["BL_319.6",319,[201,1805,1248,407]]]'> In its argument to the Court of Appeals, the State did not rely on CR 6(a). Instead, the State argued the statutory time frames in RCW 71.05.240(1) are not absolute and Mental Proceedings Rule (MPR) 1.2 allows for reasonable continuances. Br. of Resp’t at 14; MPR 1.2 (“In any judicial proceeding for involuntary commitment or detention held pursuant to RCW 71.05 the court may continue or postpone such proceeding for a reasonable time, subject to RCW 71.05.210 and RCW 71.05.240 . . . .’’). The Court of Appeals correctly rejected this argument, recognizing that MPR 1.2 explicitly calls out RCW 71.05.240(1) as placing a restraint on the court rule. Before this court, the State has abandoned its argument based on MPR 1.2 and now embraces the Court of Appeals view relying on CR 6(a).</p>

But the State presents no evidence that W.C.C. intentionally or knowingly set up the error. We reject the State’s argument and decide W.C.C.’s claim on the merits.</p>

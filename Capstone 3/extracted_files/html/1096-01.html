"Wherefore plaintiff prayed judgment for the amount of said draft, and that a lien be declared in his favor on the lease and the same ordered sold in satisfaction of the judgment, if it were not otherwise paid.</p>

This objection to the jurisdiction of the Columbia Chancery' Court was duly preserved by appellant in the answer which he filed, after his motion to quash was overruled, and throughout the trial.</p>

No claim is made that the draft would have been paid had the abstract shown a good title, nor, as we have said, was there any proof that plaintiff’s title was not a marketable one.</p>

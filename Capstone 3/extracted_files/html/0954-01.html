These investments were lost when Madoff’s fraud unraveled. FutureSelect sued Tremont, Oppenheimer Acquisition Corporation and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (Mass Mutual) (Tremont’s parent companies), and Ernst &amp; Young and Tremont’s other auditors for their failure to conduct due diligence on Madoff’s operations. FutureSelect alleged violations of the Washington state securities act (WSSA), chapter 21.20 RCW; negligence; and negligent misrepresentation.</p>

The Court of Appeals reversed. Defendants seek to reinstate the trial court’s findings. Oppenheimer argues that it lacks the requisite minimum contacts with Washington for personal jurisdiction. The defendants collectively argue that dismissing for failure to state a claim is appropriate because New York law — which does not provide for a private cause of action under its state securities act, rather than Washington law, which does — applies. Ernst &amp; Young also contends that it is not a “seller” under the WSSA. We affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>

This initiated a series of discussions between FutureSelect and Tremont regarding the Rye Funds. Tremont claimed that it was offering FutureSelect a rare, and potentially fleeting, opportunity to invest with Madoff. Tremont also made assurances about its oversight and understanding of Madoff’s operation. Relying on these assurances and the audit opinions of the accounting firm hired by Tremont, FutureSelect decided to invest in the Rye Funds in 1998. FutureSelect and Tremont had monthly ongoing communications about Madoff and the performance of the Rye Funds. Tremont claimed that its ongoing oversight and testing of Madoff proved satisfactory. Tremont also provided FutureSelect with purported facts proving the health of the Rye Funds.</p>

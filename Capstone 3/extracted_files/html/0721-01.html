Lyons Enterprises Inc. is a regional franchisor of an international janitorial franchise operating in Western Washington. The Department of Labor and Industries (L&amp;I) determined that some of Lyons’ franchisees, those that did not actually employ subordinates, met the IIA’s definition of “worker” and assessed workers’ compensation premiums against Lyons for those franchisees. The parties have now appealed the initial agency audit through four different administrative and judicial bodies that have reached varying results as to whether Lyons’ franchisees are covered workers. As part of these determinations, each adjudicative body that ruled that Lyons’ franchisees were workers has also considered whether the franchisees are exempt from coverage under this court’s decision in <em>White v.

Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 1902-03. Lyons is a regional franchisor for Jan-Pro International that operates in western Washington.</p>
    <p id="b781-6" data-blocks='[["BL_781.6",781,[202,958,1247,745]]]'>¶5 A franchisor generally provides a licensed privilege to the franchisee to operate the franchise business. A franchisee becomes part of the Jan-Pro System by entering a franchise agreement with Lyons. Under Lyons’ franchise agreement, the franchisee pays a franchise fee, a royalty for the use of the Jan-Pro name and methods, and management fees for Lyons’ business support. On each cleaning contract, franchisees must pay Lyons a 10 percent royalty fee and a 5 percent management fee. Lyons remits 3 percent of the gross billing amount to Jan-Pro International and remits the remaining amount to the franchisee. In return for the payments, franchisees are permitted to use the Jan-Pro brand and trademarks in their business and are instructed on Jan-Pro’s proprietary cleaning methods.</p>
    <p id="b781-7" data-blocks='[["BL_781.7",781,[201,1728,1247,475]]]'>¶6 All Lyons’ franchisees are independent businesses who carry their own business licenses. The franchise agreement does not explicitly require franchisees to perform any cleaning themselves, and franchisees are required to pay IIA premiums for any employees they decide to hire. The franchise agreement permits franchisees to hire and fire their own subordinates without Lyons’ review. Any subordinates must be “qualified and competent,” and franchisees are responsible for training the subordinates. CP at 328.</p>

If a franchisee accepts a cleaning contract from Lyons, the <a id="p728" href="#p728" data-label="728" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*728</a>franchisee performs the commercial cleaning services directly for the customers. Franchisees must supply their own equipment and supplies, but Lyons controls where and from whom the supplies and equipment may be obtained. Even after franchisees accept a cleaning contract, the contract remains Lyons’ property. Franchisees may also solicit their own contracts without violating the franchise agreement. In the event that a franchisee successfully obtains new business, the contract becomes Lyons’ property.</p>
    <p id="b782-4" data-blocks='[["BL_782.4",782,[202,844,1246,368]]]'>¶8 The franchise agreement precludes franchisees from providing commercial cleaning services outside of Lyons’ franchise contracts for the entire 10-year duration of the agreement.

The audit also found that Lyons substantially controlled its franchisees under RCW 51.08.195(1) and therefore did not meet that provision’s exception to coverage. L&amp;I determined that Lyons controlled the methods <a id="p729" href="#p729" data-label="729" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*729</a>used by its franchisees, which was partially indicated by its extensive training, and also that Lyons controlled the franchisees’ opportunity for profit, given its right to negotiate and its actual ownership of all of the cleaning contracts. The audit concluded that the indefinite nature of the relationship between Lyons and its franchisees suggested an employer-employee relationship. L&amp;I did not collect the $149,583.94 in past-due premiums that Lyons would otherwise have owed because the audit had an educational focus only. The audit required that Lyons, in the future, comply with all IIA reporting and premium requirements for its covered workers.</p>
    <p id="b783-4" data-blocks='[["BL_783.4",783,[201,1020,1253,963]]]'>¶12 Lyons sought agency reconsideration of the audit. In the agency reconsideration, L&amp;I concluded that <em>all </em>of Lyons’ franchisees, including those 18 who employed subordinates, were covered workers. L&amp;I also found that Lyons’ franchisees failed all six requirements of the RCW 51.08-.195 coverage exception. Lyons appealed to the Board, where an administrative law judge determined that <em>none </em>of Lyons’ franchisees were workers because they met all six requirements of the RCW 51.08.195 exception. The administrative law judge did not examine that conclusion in light of <em>White. </em>L&amp;I appealed that decision to a three-member panel of the Board, which affirmed the initial agency audit. The board panel concluded that consistent with <em>White, </em>all of the franchisees, except the 18 who employed subordinates, were covered workers under the IIA. The board panel also found Lyons’ franchisees met four of the six requirements of RCW 51.08.195, but determined the franchisees did not meet subsections (1) and (3).</p>

As explained above, FIPA was enacted with the purpose of protecting the franchisee and the IIA’s extension to FIPA regulated franchises would achieve this objective when the franchisee can also be classified as a “worker.”</p>

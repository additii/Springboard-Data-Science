Warrants were issued to him for his services and use of his truck. Of these warrants, $216.80 was for services rendered by Curtis after March 25, 1931.

In that case, both the mayor and bank officials appeared to have acted in entire good faith, and to have intended what they did for the benefit of the city, but, because of the statute which declared such contracts null and void, no benefit might accrue to the bank, since to enforce the contract would be for “the law to aid in its own undoing.”</p>

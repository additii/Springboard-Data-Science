First, in a very brief bill, the legislature authorized the Washington State Department of Licensing to enter into deals with the tribes to settle legal conflicts regarding fuel taxes “upon terms substantially the same as those in the consent decree entered by the federal district court (Eastern District of Washington) in <em>Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation v. [Department of Licensing] et al.” </em>Laws of 1995, ch. 320, §§ 2-3. Under the consent decree, the tribes agreed to buy only fuel that had already been taxed, record whether they sold the fuel to tribal or nontribal members, and allow the State to review their records. In return, the State would “refund ... the amount of motor vehicle fuel tax and special fuel tax that any seller, distributor or dealer of such fuels has paid to the State and passed on to . . . the Tribes,” measured by gallons of such fuel used by the tribes or purchased by tribal members or businesses. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 1037-38 (consent decree).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Over the next few years, the State entered into similar agreements with the Lummi, Port Gamble S’Klallam, and Skokomish Tribes to refund fuel taxes to the tribes based on gallons used by the tribes or sold to tribal members.

The act specifically carved out settlements and consent decrees already entered to settle fuel tax controversies with tribes. <em><a href="/us/515/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="515 U.S. 450" data-case-ids="1564401" data-case-paths="/us/515/0450-01">Id.</a> </em>The Squaxin Island and the Swinomish Indian Tribes challenged application of the 1998 amendments to them on the grounds that the legal incidence of the fuel tax still fell on their tribal retailers and thus the tax was unenforceable. <em>Squaxin Island Tribe v.

While this is an interesting question, no Washington case has found such an implicit constitutional requirement. <em>Tiger Oil </em>does not establish that proposition.

Thus, a factual predicate for our consideration of this issue is not present. Whether the legislature has overcome tribal immunity turns on whether the legal incidence falls on the tribe. <em>Chickasaw Nation, </em><a href="/us/515/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="515 U.S. 450" data-case-ids="1564401" data-case-paths="/us/515/0450-01">515 U.S. at 458-59</a>.

This seems to be predicated on the belief that the refund must benefit the class of taxpayers who paid the tax, rather than the taxpayers who bought the tax burdened fuel. While this is not a proposition of law that has been squarely examined in our case law, we conclude our case law does not support it. Under the tax schema in place at the time of both <em>WOHVA </em>and <em>Northwest Motorcycle, </em>the taxes would have (or, at least, should have) been paid up the distribution chain and passed on to users who <a id="p857" href="#p857" data-label="857" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*857</a>may or may not have owed it. Former RCW 82.36.035 (2005); former RCW 82.36.020 (1983). The courts did not consider whether the refunds benefited the class of those higher up the distribution chain who were legally obligated to pay the tax; the court considered whether the refunds benefited the class of those who purchased tax burdened fuel. <em>WOHVA, </em>176 Wn.2d at 228-29; <em>Nw.

App. at 414-15</a>. Analogously, here, the refunds were given to the tribes who successfully argued in federal court albeit under an earlier version of our taxing schema that they did not owe the tax and yet purchased tax burdened fuel. Tribal Fuel Tax Agreement Report, <em>supra, </em>at 2; <em>Squaxin Island Tribe, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/400/1250-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="400 F.

Const, art. II, § 40(d).

Br. of Appellant at 36-37 (quoting CP at 1431-32) (deposition of Karla Laughlin). We do not find a concession in Laughlin’s deposition.

The State argues that RCW 82.36.450 and RCW 82.38.310, which authorize the governor to enter into these agreements with tribes, and RCW 82.36.330 and RCW 46.68.090(1), which authorize the state treasurer to make disbursements from the treasury to pay refunds, provide the needed authority of law. We agree with the State. Read as a whole, it is plain that the legislature that passed Laws of 2007, chapter 515 meant to authorize the governor to negotiate with the tribes tax compacts that would contain refunds. The act amended laws that authorized agreements with terms similar to those in the Colville settlement— which required refunds — with laws that authorized the governor to negotiate agreements that “may provide mutually agreeable means to address any tribal immunities or any preemption of the state motor vehicle fuel tax.” Laws of 2007, ch. 515, §§ 19(1), 31(1). It preserved existing agreements and consent decrees, all of which that have been provided in this record include tax refunds. <em><a href="/f-supp-2d/400/1250-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="400 F.

But it points to no case where the fact that the operation of the statute turns on what individuals “may” do rendered the statute unconstitutional. This court has rejected separation of powers challenges to legislation the effectiveness of which depended on negotiation with third parties who may have chosen not to negotiate or execute contracts. <em>See, e.g., Brower v. State, </em><a href="/wash-2d/137/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="137 Wash. 2d 44" data-case-ids="179438" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/137/0044-01">137 Wn.2d 44</a>, 55, <a href="/citations/?q=969%20P.2d%2042" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="969 P.2d 42">969 P.2d 42</a> (1998) (“[T]he Legislature may <a id="p861" href="#p861" data-label="861" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*861</a>condition the effectiveness of legislation on the acts of a private party who may possibly benefit from the legislation.”); <em>Diversified Inv.

The statutes require regular audits and reports to the legislature, RCW 82.36.450(3)(c), (6); RCW 82.38.310(3)(c), (6), which AUTO deems inadequate. It is certainly correct that RCW 82.36.450 and RCW 82.38.310 themselves do not contain strong procedural safeguards against the legislature, governor, and the tribes failing to police the agreements. But separation of powers does not require the safeguards be found in the same statute under challenge — just that the safeguards exist. <em>Barry &amp; Barry, </em>81 Wn.2d at 158-59. We have found sufficient safeguards exist because of administrative review and the availability of writs of certiorari, among other things. <em>See, e.g., id.; City of Auburn v.

No obvious route for administrative review appears here, but should the executive and legislature both fail to police against administrative abuse of power, third parties would not be completely without a remedy. They could, for example, as AUTO did below, challenge the agreements on the grounds the legislature is <a id="p862" href="#p862" data-label="862" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*862</a>giving a privilege to the tribes that is not enjoyed by others similarly situated in violation of the privileges and immunities clause (article I, section 12 of the state constitution), which, frankly, seems to be AUTO’s real complaint — the abiding suspicion that the tribes got a privilege that they should not have.</p>

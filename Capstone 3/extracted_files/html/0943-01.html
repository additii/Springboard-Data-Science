It is argued that § 12, relating to withdrawals, does not apply to fully-paid certificates of stock. No class of stock is excepted, but the statute expressly provides for the withdrawal of “all classes of shares, stock or certificates.” Appellee says he did not give notice of withdrawal, but of demand for pavment. The effect of a demand for payment would be notice to the association of the intention to withdraw membership, and whether it be called “demand for pav<a id="p947" href="#p947" data-label="947" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*947</a>anent” or “notice-of withdrawal” is immaterial, for the result would he the same, and the demand or application could not be paid in any event out of more than one-half of the monthly receipts of the association in any one month, and then only in the order of its filing. The maturity of the stock and the demand for its payment would not serve to change the relationship from stockholder to general creditor as contended. Our conclusion in this respect has the support of the weight of authority, and in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where the rule, was first announced as contended for by the appellee, later decisions seem to have abandoned it. <em>Fornatoro </em>v. <em>Atl.

On the 5th day of March, 1900, the association was declared insolvent by the chancery court, and receivers were appointed to administer its assets under the orders of the court. The holders of the notes intervened and prayed for judgment for the amount due, as shown by the notes, on the theory that they were general creditors, invoking the rule contended for by the appellee in the case at bar. The trial court gave judgment for the note holders, but the Supreme Court reversed that judgment, saying: “The court erred in rendering judgment for appellees as if they were creditors of the association.

    <p id="b967-4" data-blocks='[["BL_967.5",967,[204,1289,1200,1169]]]'>In the case of <em>Miers </em>v. <em>Columbia Mutual B. &amp; L. Ass’n, </em><a href="/citations/?q=157%20F.%20490" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="157 F. 490">157 Fed. 490</a>, the court, in discussing a contention similar to that of the appellee in the case at bar last noted above, had this to say: “The claimant contends that, assuming the insolvency of the association at the time his withdrawal application was accepted, he is entitled to preferential payment; his status from that time being that of a creditor. The contention ignores the qualification of the liability of the association contained in the bylaws that no more than ‘one-half the monthly dues received in any month’ shall be applied to the payment of withdrawing members.” A number of cases are cited, and the court continues: “It is true that in some of the cases cited by the master the involved associations were insolvent, and in others they had ceased to do business and were unable to repay the dues paid by the withdrawing members; but, even assuming that the evidence in this case does not strictly disclose the insolvency of the respondent at the period of the withdrawal notice in suit, the claimant was nevertheless required to prove that available funds were in the possession of the respondent to meet the repayment demanded at the time of the appointment of the receivers.”</p>

      <a id="p950" href="#p950" data-label="950" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*950</a>In a majority of the cases holding that a withdrawing member is a creditor, there is no controversy involving the rights of the general creditors, the contentions being between the different classes of shareholders. The members, who had withdrawn and demanded payment for their certificates, claimed to be preferred and entitled to full payment before the other shareholders were entitled to anything. Those shareholders who had not given notice claimed that all the shareholders should participate equally in the distribution of the assets of the insolvent company. Some of these cases turn on the language of the statutes and bylaws, and it is generally held in those cases that the right of the withdrawing shareholder to receive payment must be limited to the manner prescribed by the bylaws and payable out of the funds made applicable thereto.</p>
    <p id="b968-3" data-blocks='[["BL_968.4",968,[277,1180,1195,402]]]'>In <em>Rabbitt </em>v. <em>Wilcoxen, supra, </em>the court said: “It seems to us that these authorities, as well as the language of the bylaws of the association in this case, fix a limitation on the. rights of withdrawing shareholders as to the funds applicable to the payment of their claims, and that beyond such limit they cannot go. In this case there is, confessedly, no such fund available. * * * Insolvency but adds to the strength of such a position.”</p>

Indeed, the evidence shows that there are a great number of members holding fully paid certificates who have made application for their money, but have not been paid because there are no funds available, and there is no claim made that the association has diverted any of its funds, but only that it has been paying debts owing to general creditors to the exclusion of the appellee’s claim and the claims of others similarly situated. There appears to be 2,280 applications of holders of certificates for withdrawal and payment. Of this number 820 have been paid in the order of the filing of their applications. There remain 1,460 applications unpaid, and 1,057 of these were filed prior to that of the appellee. The association, in acknowledging the demand <a id="p951" href="#p951" data-label="951" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*951</a>made by the appellee, advised Mm that it was allowed to use not exceeding fifty per cent, of its income in any one month to pay for withdrawals; that, because of the unusual business depression, its monthly income had been reduced, and that his claim would be paid at the earliest possible date, and as soon as reached in the order of its filing.</p>
    <p id="b969-3" data-blocks='[["BL_969.4",969,[211,726,1197,446]]]'>The question of the solvency or insolvency of the appellant and a number of others are raised by the parties. These we refrain from discussing for the reason that we have reached the. conclusion that the appellee’s status, in any view of the case, is not that of a general creditor, and that he therefore is not entitled to the relief he seeks, which was granted by the trial court. It follows that the judgment is reversed, and the case dismissed.</p>

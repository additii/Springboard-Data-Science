After pulling the truck over, the trooper noticed that Sandholm had watery, bloodshot eyes and smelled of alcohol. Sandholm also slurred his speech and displayed poor coordination. He displayed six out of six signs of possible intoxication during his field sobriety test. The trooper arrested Sandholm. Breath alcohol tests, taken approximately two hours later, showed that Sandholm had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.079 and 0.080.</p>

Specifically, the State charged Sandholm under former RCW 46.61.502 (2008)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> with driving while “under the influence of or affected by intoxicating liquor or any drug; and while under the combined influence of or affected by intoxicating liquor and any drug; having at least four prior offenses, as defined under [former] RCW 46.61.5055(14)(a) [(2008)] within ten years of the arrest for the current offense.” Clerk’s Papers at 329. At trial, the State presented evidence of Sandholm’s physical condition, his failed field sobriety tests, his BAC level, and his own admission that he had drunk whiskey earlier in the night. It did not present evidence that Sandholm was under the influence of any drug or advance such a theory of the case. Sandholm himself, however, testified that earlier on the day of his arrest, he had taken Orajel and ibuprofen to soothe a toothache, and that when those remedies failed, he turned to whiskey. The “to convict” instructions provided to the jury presented two alternative statutory means to commit DUI: either that Sandholm was under the influence of alcohol <em>or </em>drugs, or that Sandholm was under the <em>combined </em>influence of alcohol <em>and </em>drugs. 11A Washington Practice: Washington Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal 92.02, at 274-75 (3d ed. 2008) (WPIC). The trial judge also instructed the jury that it did not need to be unanimous as to the means by which it returned a guilty verdict. Sandholm objected to inclusion of the combined influence of alcohol and drugs instruction, arguing that there was “absolutely zero testimony anywhere in the record that any of these things can impair an individual to the slightest degree or their driving.” Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Feb. 9, 2012) at 100. During closing argument, the State exclusively discussed evidence of Sandholm’s drinking, never mentioning the use of ibuprofen or Orajel. The jury convicted Sandholm.

Therefore, it concluded that a rational jury could not have found for a means supported by <em>no </em>evidence and could have found Sandholm guilty only if it had unanimously agreed that he drove under the influence of alcohol or drugs: in essence, a harmlessness analysis.

The defendant had argued that the statute created three different alternative means to commit the offense of failing to register as a sex offender: (1) failing to register after becoming homeless, (2) failing to register after moving between fixed residences within a county, and (3) failing to register after moving from one county to another. We found this reading too simplistic. Rather than describing distinct acts, we concluded the alleged “alternatives” each described the same single act: failure to register as a sex offender without alerting the appropriate authorities. Thus, the statute created a single means to commit the crime. <em>Peterson, </em>168 Wn.2d at 770. Similarly, in <em>Owens, </em>we held that the trafficking in stolen property statute, RCW 9A.82.050,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> describes two—not eight—alternative means to commit the offense. The first seven alleged “alternatives” represented multiple facets of a <a id="p735" href="#p735" data-label="735" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*735</a>single means, while the eighth alternative was a true alternative because it described a separate category of conduct. <em>Owens, </em>180 Wn.2d at 97-98.

In conducting this analysis, less weight is placed on the use of the disjunctive “or” and more weight on the distinctiveness of the criminal conduct. Thus, in order to decide whether an error exists in this case, we must first determine whether former RCW 46.61.502(2008) creates alternative means to commit the offense of DUI under its various “affected by” clauses.

Under this analysis, the DUI statute’s “affected by” clauses do not describe multiple, distinct types of conduct that can reasonably be interpreted as creating alternative means. Rather, those portions of the DUI statute contemplate only one type of conduct: driving a vehicle under the “influence of” or while “affected by” certain substances that may impair the driver. Former RCW 46.61.502(2008). These statutory subsections describe facets of the same conduct, not distinct criminal acts. Whether the defendant is driving under the influence of alcohol, or drugs, or marijuana, or some combination thereof, the defendant’s <em>conduct </em>is the same—operating a vehicle while under the influence of certain substances. The fact that one substance or multiple substances may have caused that influence does not change the fundamental nature of the “influence of” or “affected by” criminal act.

The “except as provided in (e)” language cannot be read in isolation. On the contrary, subsection (2)(c) explicitly says it is to be read in light of former subsection (2)(e). Although Sandholm points to other examples in the SRA where such language makes a provision exclusive, “except as provided in (e)” must be read in light of the subsection it references. Former subsection (2)(e) contains no express language that indicates that it is an exclusive scoring provision when the present conviction is for felony DUI. Sandholm’s reading is also contradictory to the statutory scheme because, following this logic, subsection (2)(a)’s strongly worded mandate that class <a id="p738" href="#p738" data-label="738" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*738</a>A and prior felony sex convictions “shall always be included” would similarly not count when the present conviction is for felony DUI.

In <em>Morales, </em>Division One of the Court of Appeals concluded that former subsection (2)(e) was an exclusive scoring provision when the present conviction is for felony DUI, reasoning that the washout procedures set out in former subsection (2)(e)(i) would be rendered superfluous because of their similarity to the washout procedures in subsection (2)(c) unless former subsection (2)(e) was exclusive. <em>Morales, </em><a href="/wash-app/168/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="168 Wash.

This reasoning ignores that the offenses listed under former subsection (2)(e) include both felonies and nonfelonies, and therefore add prior convictions to the offender score that would not normally be included. Although the analysis under former subsection (2)(e)(i) would seem superfluous to some offenses listed in former subsection (2)(e) that could also be counted under subsection (2)(c), “serious traffic offenses,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> for example, would not be analyzed under subsection (2)(c) because they include misdemeanors and subsection (2)(c) applies only to felonies.

Under that approach, calculation of an offender score has three steps: first, identify all prior convictions; second, eliminate those that wash out; and third, count the prior convictions that remain. <em>Moeurn, </em>170 Wn.2d at 175. We reasoned that the legislature intended this procedure because the statute itself is structured to apply its provisions in the order in which they appear. Step one under <em>Moeurn </em>is to count <em>all </em>prior offenses: this includes Sandholm’s two drug convictions. Under Sandholm’s reading, rather than counting all prior offenses, step one would be to determine the present conviction and then jump to that specific section. This contradicts our holding in <em>Moeurn </em>that the provisions are meant to be analyzed sequentially.</p>

This subsection expresses the legislature’s intent that repeat DUI offenders not benefit from the washout provisions contained in the previous subsections of the SRA for prior traffic and driving offenses. Former subsection (2)(e) adds to the list of offenses that shall be included in an offender score; it does not narrow it. That means all other offenses, such as Sandholm’s prior drug offenses, are to be scored as they would otherwise. We reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue and affirm the trial court’s sentencing decision.</p>

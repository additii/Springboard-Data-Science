No. 16, </em><a href="/ark/154/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="154 Ark. 176" data-case-ids="1361245" data-case-paths="/ark/154/0176-01">154 Ark. 176</a>, petitioners sought by mandamus to compel the directors of the school district to allow them to attend school. Those petitioners had not been expelled, but had been excluded; and, while the action of the directors was approved and mandamus denied, we recognized mandamus as the appropriate remedy to obtain the relief sought. We there held that the educational interests and school affairs in each school district in the State are placed bjr statute, under the control and management of the school directors, and that to effectively exercise this authority a broad discretion must be accorded them, and in that connection it was said: “In defining the authority conferred upon the board, this court took occasion to say, in the case of <em>Maddox </em>v. <em>Neal, </em><a href="/ark/45/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="45 Ark. 121" data-case-ids="1892051" data-case-paths="/ark/45/0121-01">45 Ark. 121</a>, that, while their authority is not without limit, yet <em>‘a </em>wide range of discretion is vested in these boards by the statute in the matter of government and details of conducting the common schools.’ Courts will not interfere in matters of detail and government of schools, unless the officers refuse to perform a clear, plain duty, or unless they unreasonably and arbitrarily exercise the <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>discretionary authority conferred upon them. We think the correct rule was laid down in the case of <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em><a href="/mass/157/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="157 Mass. 561" data-case-ids="803908" data-case-paths="/mass/157/0561-01">157 Mass. 561</a>. It was said by Mr. Justice Knowlton, in rendering the opinion in that case, that ‘under the law the school committee has the general charge and superintendence of all the public schools in the town. The management of the schools involves many details, and it is important that a board of public officers, dealing with these details and having jurisdiction to regulate the internal affairs of the schools, should not be interfered with, or have their conduct called in question before any other tribunal, so long' as they act in good faith within their jurisdiction.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b276-5" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[311,1033,1205,983]]]'>Was the rule in question a reasonable one, and did the directors have the right to make and enforce it? We answer this question in the affirmative. The law as quoted from.the Black case, <em>supra, </em>finds ample support in numerous decisions of other courts. A more general statement of the law applicable to the facts of this case is found in 24 B. C. L. at section 24 of the article on Schools, reading as follows: “The courts will not interfere with the exercise of discretion by school directors in matters confided by law to their judgment, unless there is a clear abuse of the discretion, or a violation of law. So the courts are usually disinclined to interfere with regulations adopted by school boards, and they will not consider whether the regulations are wise or expedient, but merely whether they are a reasonable exercise of the power and discretion of the board.” Many cases supporting this text are collected in the following annotated cases: <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>13 Ann. Cas. 330 <em>Kinzer </em>v. <em>Directors, </em>6 Ann. Cas. 996.</p>

On the contrary, we must uphold the rule,unless we find that the directors have clearly abused their discretion, and that the rule is <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>not one reasonably calculated to effect the purpose intended, that is, of promoting discipline in the school, and we do not so find.</p>

That was a case in which an order depriving a pupil of his diploma for refusal to wear a cap and gown at graduation was held unreasonable; but, in so holding, the Supreme Court of Iowa announced as the test of reasonableness of school rules substantially the one stated above.</p>
    <p id="b277-6" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[157,1076,1200,460]]]'>Courts have other and more important functions to perform than that of hearing the complaints of disaffected pupils of the public schools against rules and regulations promulgated by the school boards for the government of the schools. The courts have this right of review, for the reasonableness of such rule is a judicial question, and the courts will not refuse to perform their functions in determining the reasonableness of such rules, when the question is presented.</p>
    <p id="b277-7" data-blocks='[["BL_277.6",277,[152,1565,1204,769]]]'>But, in doing so, it will be kept in mind that the directors are elected by the patrons of the schools over which they preside, and the election occurs annually. These directors are in close and intimate touch with the affairs of their respective districts, and know the conditions with which they have to deal. It will be remembered also that respect for constituted 'authority, and obedience thereto, is an essential lesson to qualify one for the duties of citizenship, and that the schoolroom is an appropriate place to teach that lesson. So that the courts hesitate to substitute their will and judgment for that of the school boards, which are delegated by law as the agencies to prescribe rules for the government of the public schools of the State, which are supported at the public expense.</p>

It does not appear unreasonable in any of these respects. Upon the contrary, we have a rule which imposes no affirmative duty, and no showing was made, 'or attempted, that the talcum powder possessed any medicinal properties, or was used otherwise than as a .cosmetic.</p>

A proper showing has been made to this court that the rule complained of was rescinded after this appeal was perfected. The case is therefore moot.

Miss Pearl Pugsley was 18 years old on the 15th of August, 1922. I think that a rule forbidding a girl pupil of her age from putting talcum powder on her face is so far unreasonable and beyond <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>the exercise of discretion that the court should say that the board of directors acted without authority in making and enforcing it. “Useless laws diminish the authority of necessary ones.” The tone of the majority opinion exemplifies the wisdom of this old proverb.</p>

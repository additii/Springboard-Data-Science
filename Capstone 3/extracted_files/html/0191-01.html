Trooper Stone’s radar captured Quaale’s speed at 56 miles per hour. Trooper Stone activated the lights on his patrol car and attempted to pull the truck over. In response, Quaale turned off his truck’s headlights and accelerated.</p>
    <p id="b230-7" data-blocks='[["BL_230.7",230,[201,1009,1247,526]]]'>¶3 Trooper Stone pursued. Quaale lost control and overshot a corner, skidding into a homeowner’s yard before he regained control and sped away for several more blocks. After Trooper Stone activated his siren, Quaale pulled the truck over and stopped. Quaale exited his truck but did not attempt to flee on foot. As a part of standard pursuit protocol, Trooper Stone ordered Quaale to the ground and handcuffed him. As he approached Quaale, Trooper Stone smelled a strong odor of “intoxicants” on Quaale’s breath. Partial Verbatim Report of Proceedings (RP) at 12.</p>

The HGN test is a routinely used field sobriety test in which the administrator tells the subject to follow a pen or fingertip with his or her eyes as the administrator moves the stimulus from side to side. After consuming alcohol, a person will have difficulty smoothly following the stimulus; the person’s eyes will jerk or bounce as they move from side to side. Trooper Stone testified that in his opinion, the HGN test is very important to determining impairment because unlike the walk the line test, which a person can practice, the HGN test measures an involuntary reflex. <em>Id. </em>at 27. Trooper Stone did not perform any other sobriety tests on Quaale in the field.</p>

Indeed, during its rebuttal, in response to the defense explanation for the odor of intoxicants, the State said, “The horizontal gaze nystagmus is not caused by alcohol that he may have spilled on his clothes; it is what is inside your body.

This testimony was improper for two reasons. First, the trooper cast his testimony in a way that gave it an aura of scientific certainty.

Even though the testimony did not include a numerical blood alcohol level, the testimony implicitly includes a specific level of intoxication: that the alcohol consumed impaired the defendant, which is the legal standard for guilt. The HGN test alone cannot reveal specific levels of intoxication, and, consequently, the trooper’s testimony violated <em>Baity.</em>

Thus, the trooper concluded that alcohol diminished Quaale to such an appreciable degree that the HGN test could detect Quaale’s impairment.

The parties did not raise the issue of the HGN test’s scientific merits at trial, and there is no evidence in the record regarding any scientific studies on the test, its accuracy, or its limits. We are not optometrists or drug recognition experts, and we should not make such conclusive scientific determinations in the absence of evidence and testimony from experts in the field. This is particularly problematic because limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the HGN test creates a way for drunk drivers to evade prosecution by refusing the breath test and being so uncooperative with police officers that conducting other sobriety tests is not feasible.</p>

Officers administer the HGN test to persons suspected of driving under the influence (DUI). Generally, officers take a pen or other stimulus, hold it 12 to 15 inches away from a suspect’s face, and move the pen from side to side to check for eye nystagmus.

The crucial foundation testimony Trooper Stone gave about the HGN test was that if the nystagmus of the eye starts earlier in the test, it means the test subject is more impaired. Specifically, when the prosecutor asked Trooper Stone when the eye nystagmus started in this case, Trooper Stone responded:</p>

Additionally, the jury heard testimony that (1) Quaale was driving 56 miles per hour in a 25-mile-per-hour residential zone, (2) Quaale overshot a corner and skidded into a homeowner’s yard, leaving 98 feet of skid marks, (3) Trooper Stone immediately smelled a strong odor of intoxicants on Quaale’s breath when he approached Quaale, and (4) when Trooper Stone drove Quaale to the station, he had to roll the windows down because the alcohol smell was so strong.</p>

First, Trooper Stone’s opinion did not parrot the legal standard, as the word “impaired” does not appear in the DUI statute. <em>See </em>RCW 46.61.502. Rather, a person is guilty of a DUI for driving “[w]hile the person is under the influence of or affected by intoxicating liquor.” RCW 46.61-.502(l)(c).

    <p id="b245-5" data-blocks='[["BL_245.6",245,[119,1458,1252,899]]]'>¶41 I find few differences here. Trooper Stone never testified that he thought Quaale was guilty of DUI. Instead, he testified about the HGN test, Quaale’s dangerous and poor driving, and the strong odor of intoxicants on Quaale’s breath — all of which directly and logically support Trooper Stone’s conclusion that he had “no doubt” Quaale was impaired. Although the prosecutor unartfully asked whether Trooper Stone formed an opinion based on the HGN test alone, any rational juror would have clearly processed Trooper Stone’s opinion in conjunction with his personal observations of Quaale’s dangerous driving and breath. The fact that Trooper Stone’s testimony directly supports a finding of guilt is not fatal — that is precisely what makes it relevant. And Trooper Stone’s “no doubt” language mirrors the permissible conclusory term that the defendant was “ ‘obviously intoxicated’ ” in <em>Heatley. Id. </em>at 576.</p>

    <p id="b246-5" data-blocks='[["BL_246.6",246,[210,623,1247,1166]]]'>¶43 Quaale’s primary defense was that Trooper Stone failed to conduct a thorough investigation. Trooper Stone’s “no doubt” testimony did nothing to hinder Quaale’s defense; arguably, it strengthened it. Read in isolation, Trooper Stone testified that based on the HGN test alone, he concluded Quaale was impaired. On cross-examination, the officer acknowledged that there are other standard field sobriety tests that he did not perform, including the “walk and turn” and the “one leg stand,” because he did not want to risk Quaale running off again. PVRP at 34-35. He also acknowledged that his police report failed to include anything about Quaale’s coordination, attitude, or clothes, or whether he had watery or bloodshot eyes, a flushed face, or slurred speech. Quaale was able to develop his defense attacking the investigation and Trooper Stone’s credibility for basing his conclusion solely on the HGN test. Additionally, the defense differentiated between the level of certainty needed to make an arrest and the level needed to convict. Trooper Stone readily acknowledged that his investigation is intended to develop probable cause and that probable cause is not the same as beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

As mentioned above, this court has cautioned that “opinion testimony should be avoided if the information can be presented in such a way that the <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>jury can draw its own conclusions.” <em>Montgomery, </em>163 Wn.2d at 591. But here, the State could not present additional evidence in a way that would have better allowed the jury to draw its own conclusions about Quaale’s impairment because of Quaale’s bad conduct. Trooper Stone did not conduct other field sobriety tests because Quaale had just led him on a chase down a residential road at night, and far from backup in a remote area, Trooper Stone feared that Quaale would attempt to flee again if he released him to perform the other tests. The State could not submit evidence from a breath test because Quaale refused to take it. The State has a legitimate concern when it asks, “How would DUI prosecutions based on a refusal to take the breath test be prosecuted if the police officer cannot express an opinion regarding the defendant’s impairment?” Suppl. Br. of Pet’r at 8. The majority’s decision will seriously hinder DUI prosecutions in which defendants refuse the breath test and are so uncooperative that field sobriety tests other than the HGN test are not feasible.</p>
    <p id="b247-4" data-blocks='[["BL_247.5",247,[137,1411,1251,594]]]'>¶46 In DUI prosecutions not involving the breath test, the State often has to prove that the suspect was affected by alcohol using officer testimony alone. The evidence rules allow that testimony to go to the ultimate factual issue before the jury. ER 704. And, as in this case, that testimony is permissible as long as an officer refrains from testifying that he or she believes that the defendant is guilty. This factor does not weigh against admissibility because the State did not rely solely on the HGN test to prove guilt and Quaale’s bad conduct hindered Trooper Stone’s ability to administer the other field sobriety tests.</p>
    <p id="b247-5" data-blocks='[["BL_247.6",247,[137,2032,1251,265]]]'>¶47 Thus, after analyzing the factors, I would find Trooper Stone’s testimony permissible.

The majority improperly uses <em>Baity </em>to make its own scientific determination about HGN tests without any basis in the record, and it incentivizes drunk drivers to be uncooperative with officers in order to limit the amount of evidence the State can use at trial. I would not come to such rigid conclusions about what the HGN test can tell us regarding alcohol impairment without a full record developed at the trial level. After analyzing Trooper Stone’s “no doubt” testimony under the <em>Demery </em>factors, I conclude that Quaale’s right to have facts adjudicated by a jury was not violated. I respectfully dissent.</p>

Roughly a week and a half before trial, the trial court held an initial readiness hearing where it informed the parties that it typically used a jury questionnaire in sexual assault cases to discover sensitive information that might require questioning jurors individually. The court explained that in light of recent appellate court decisions, the practice of questioning jurors in chambers conflicted with Herron’s public trial right. Thus, the court stated that “if there is any objection, I can’t — follow that procedure — .” 1 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) at 69 (June 8, 2007).

Alternatively, the prosecuting attorney suggested that the court could question individual jurors in a public setting with the other jurors waiting in a separate room. Defense counsel responded that he would not object and that “if we’re looking for an affirmative waiver of a public examination of these individual jurors, Mr. Herron and I are present, we’re certainly willing to waive that. ...

First, mere silence is not sufficient to constitute waiver. <em>State v. Wise, </em><a href="/wash-2d/176/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="176 Wash. 2d 1" data-case-ids="4306658" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/176/0001-01">176 Wn.2d 1</a>, 15, <a href="/citations/?q=288%20P.3d%201113" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="288 P.3d 1113">288 P.3d 1113</a> (2012) (defendant does not waive right to a public trial by failing to object). Rather, the defendant must be provided with a meaningful opportunity to object. For instance, in <em>Bone-Club, </em>we held that the trial court’s “summary closure” deprived the defendant of a meaningful opportunity to object. We stated that “an opportunity to object holds no ‘practical meaning’ unless the court informs potential objectors of the nature of the asserted interests.” 128 Wn.2d at 261 (quoting <em>Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, </em><a href="/wash-2d/97/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="97 Wash. 2d 30" data-case-ids="1154995" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/97/0030-01">97 Wn.2d 30</a>, 39, <a href="/citations/?q=640%20P.2d%20716" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="640 P.2d 716">640 P.2d 716</a> (1982)). We similarly acknowledged in <em>State v. Easterling </em>that a defendant does not waive his ability to challenge an improper closure on appeal by failing to lodge a contemporaneous objection. Notably, we faulted the trial court for failing to affirmatively provide the defendant with an opportunity to object. <a href="/wash-2d/157/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="157 Wash. 2d 167" data-case-ids="3004470" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/157/0167-01">157 Wn.2d 167</a>, 176 n.8, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20P.3d%20825" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="137 P.3d 825">137 P.3d 825</a> (2006).</p>

Rather, the trial court provided Herron with several meaningful opportunities to object. Roughly a week and a half before trial, the court advised Herron that it would not question individual jurors in chambers if Herron objected and the State presented an alternative to closure. Although both defense counsel and Herron related that they preferred to have individual juror questioning conducted in chambers, the trial court instructed Herron to discuss the issue further with defense counsel and postponed any decision. One week later, the court revisited the topic again and stated to Herron that “it is totally your decision as to how [voir dire] is handled” and again provided Herron with an alternative option to closure. 1 VRP at 105 (June 15, 2007).

The trial court eventually found that Herron made a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver based on these extensive colloquies from two separate hearings. Defense counsel even indicated that Herron was “willing to sign a written waiver to that effect as well.” <em>Id. </em>at 109.

Contrary to suffering an injury, Herron actually benefited from the in-chambers questioning because he was better able to obtain a fair and impartial jury. At one point, defense counsel thanked one potential juror for his honesty and candor, explaining, “That’s exactly why we’re . . . going through this process.” 1-A VRP at 93 (June 18, 2007). Another juror disclosed for the first time in her life that she had been molested by an uncle. Although the judge overruled the defense’s challenge to this juror, the defense later used a peremptory challenge to excuse her. Eventually, four other jurors were excused for cause based on the individual questioning. There was no injury.</p>

Herron argues that he has a special relationship with the public because he shares an interest in the perception of fairness and integrity of the prosecution. However, as the Court of <a id="p747" href="#p747" data-label="747" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*747</a>Appeals acknowledged, Herron’s interest here was actually inimical to the public’s interest. <em>Herron, </em><a href="/wash-app/177/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="177 Wash.

Herron sought to obtain a closed proceeding so that jurors could candidly discuss their views on sexual assault, thus better allowing Herron to discover and remove biased jurors. This contrasts with the public’s interest to have access to jury selection. Thus, there is no “congruence of interests” that would sustain a finding of a special relationship. <em>Powers, </em><a href="/us/499/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="499 U.S. 400" data-case-ids="11319062" data-case-paths="/us/499/0400-01">499 U.S. at 414</a>.</p>

Herron argues that the trial court failed to provide notice to the public before closing the court, depriving the public from asserting its own interests. But the trial court and parties discussed the closure in open court on two separate days. Thus, members of the press or public had two separate occasions to voice any concern. Moreover, the press has regularly asserted its right to the open administration of <em>justice </em>— see, <em>e.g., Ishikawa, </em>97 Wn.2d at 32; <em>Federated Publ’ns, Inc. v.

The trial court did not impose any barriers that would prevent a member of the press or public from asserting his or her rights.

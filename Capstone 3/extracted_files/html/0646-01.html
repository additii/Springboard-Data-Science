      <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>In <em>Hixon vs. Weaver, </em>4 <em>Eng. </em>137, this court held that the Circuit Court could not, by a rule of practice, require a defendant to file his pleas by the fourth day of the term, if the case was not then called for trialj that the statute gave the privilege of withholding a plea till the cause was on its regular call, and that no rule of practice could restrict the time so given for pleading, although the time might be extended by the court. From the statute thus construed, it follows that a defendant, served with process thirty days before court, has secured to him a longer time to plead, than if the writ had been served less than thirty and more than fifteen days before the return day of the writ. For in such a case, by the 54th section of the chapter quoted from, a defendant must file his plea to the merits by the third day of the term, or sooner, if the court should not last three days. And if a Circuit Court can enlarge the time for pleading, the same principle of construction adopted in <em>Hixon vs. Weaver, </em>that of implied obedience to the letter of a statute regulating the practice of Circuit Courts, would require that the statute should be observed when it provides that in no case shall a further time given for pleading extend beyond the term. But in <em>Browning vs. Roane, </em>4 <em>Eng. </em>354, it was decided that a continuance at one term by the plaintiff to await the progress of a suit in chancery between the same parties to restrain the defendant from having the benefit of a proposed plea, was such an implied enlargement of the time of pleading as would excuse the defendant' from pleading till the chancery suit should be decided or abandoned, and that a default taken at a subsequent term, before the trial of the'suit in chancery. was irregulai’. This is an assumption that the time for pleading may be extended beyond the trial term, and it cannot be inferred that the court, in the case before it, gave greater effect to an enlargement of time to plead, that was only construed to be such from an act of the plaintiff, than it would have given to an express order of the court for further time to plead. In <em>Carrol vs. Harris, </em><a href="/citations/?q=19%20Ark.%20239" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="19 Ark. 239">19 <em>Ark, </em>239</a>, this court expressly said, that the Circuit Court might have allowed the defendant <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>until the next term to file an amended plea, upon an application and showing. From our knowledge of the practice of courts in this State, we know that nothing is more common than for Circuit Courts, upon, application of defendants, and. against the objection oí plaintiffs, to extend the time for pleading to a subsequent term of the court, when justice to defendants seems to require it to be done. This is in accordance with remarks made in an early opinion of this court, signifying that it was a necessary and inherent power pertaining to the courts in the administration of justice, that they should be allowed to exercise their usual discretion for the attainment of justice, though the statutory provisions under which they might be acting, might not confer, or seem to imply any such authority. <em>Wilson vs. </em>Phillips, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Ark.%20184" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Ark. 184">5 <em>Ark., </em>184</a>. This, with several other decisions of this court, recognizing and applying the same principle, was cited and approved in <em>Gould vs. Tatum, </em><a href="/ark/21/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="21 Ark. 329" data-case-ids="1868234" data-case-paths="/ark/21/0329-01">21 <em>Ark., </em>329</a>, and on page 331, are some general observations, to which we refer as bearing upon this case.</p>
    <p id="b657-5" data-blocks='[["BL_657.5",657,[110,1414,1204,597]]]'>The practice that.has grown up under our statute and its construction in <em>Hixon vs. Weaver, </em>is very embarrassing to Circuit Courts, in taking away from them the power to discharge business with proper deliberation, and with desirable promptness. For, an obstinate or crafty attorney, by withholding his defence till the case is called for trial, may then file numerous and complicated and conflicting pleas, and thus ensnare the opposite party, or the court into some step, or ruling, that a different and reasonable rule of practice would give time to avoid': or secure a continuance, thus prostrating or delaying the course of justice.</p>

Every lawyer must know that where difficult pleas are filed on the call of a case, it is not a call for trial; for it may take much thought and study to determine with intelli.gence what response to make, or if a mode of reply may be soon adopted, its preparation may take more time than courts can give.</p>

    <p id="b658-6" data-blocks='[["BL_658.6",658,[247,1181,1203,488]]]'>In the case under consideration, the court called the docket late in the term: sufficient time had elapsed for every defendant to have prepared his defence, at least to have employed a lawyer so as to inform the court that a case was a contested case, and though it had been announced that, on the call that would be made, no causes would be tried, and all would be continued but such as were undefended, in which judgments by default would be rendered, this was still a regular calling of the docket within the 53d section of the statute above quoted.</p>

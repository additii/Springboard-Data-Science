Parcel II of the property was, as hereinbefore shown, subsequently conveyed by W. B. Worthen Company to Vaughan and from Vaughan to Mrs. Bunch, where the legal title appears still to rest. T. H. Bunch has never conveyed his undivided half interest in parcel III, which he inherited from his mother, except by an unrecorded deed to his wife and except the mortgage to Kavanaugh as trustee for the Southern Trust Company. The contention of appellants is that the title to all of the property is in the Southern Trust Company as trustee for Mrs. Bunch, but the contention of appellee is that T. H.

H. Bunch. The contention is that Bunch was acting merely as agent for his wife, but there is correspondence in the record which .shows that it is generally referred to as Bunch’s property. At any rate, according to the proof, there was never any visible change in the possession of the property from the time it was originally acquired by T. H. Bunch, and there is nothing of record showing any title or interest in Laura L. Bunch except the deed from Vaughan to Mrs. Bunch covering the property mentioned as parcel II. All the property was held and managed together, and the proof tends to show that, to all appearances, it was held as the property of T. H. Bunch.</p>

The only written declaration of trust was never put of record, and the other declarations were oral. There was nothing to put creditors upon notice that the beneficial interest was in Mrs. Bunch. The conveyances to the Worthen Company showed on their face that they held as trustee, and there was nothing to disclose to the public who the beneficiary was. In the meantime, to all appearances. Bunch himself was controlling the property.

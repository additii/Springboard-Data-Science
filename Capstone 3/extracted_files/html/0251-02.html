Tbe Union Printing Company, tbe firm of Smifchee and Newman, tbe firm of Mitchell &amp; Bettis, and George Woodruff, submitted separate bids for said printing. Tbe bids were all rejected, tbe Board being apparently unable to determine who was tbe lowest bidder. This was on tbe 30th of June, 1882. They then gave notice for ten days that proposals for printing and printing material would be received until 10 a. m., of July 10th. Thereupon the above mentioned four bidders entered into an agreement that a bid should be made in the name of George Woodruff, for the joint and equal benefit of them all. 'Upon this bid the contract was awarded to him, and on tbe first of January, 1883, be entered upon tbe performance of said contract. ' He died on tbe 27th of January, 1883, and letters of administration were granted to tbe appellant. On tbe 21st of February, 1883, the Legislature disaffirmed this contract, assigning for its reason that the statutory notice of the letting had not been given, and directing the Board to relet the contract. The Board published an advertisement inviting proposals, whereupon the administrator of George Woodruff filed the present bill to restrain the members of the Board from letting said contract anew, <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>or otherwise interfering with the plaintiff in the performance of his intestate’s contract.</p>

He bid to do the grading at three cents per cubic yard. At the same time there were other bids put in, one at seven cents, one at fourteen and one at forty-two cents per cubic yard. The plaintiff' not having entered upon the work under his contract, in what the commissioners held to be a reasonable time, they relet the contract privately at forty-two cents per yard to the same parties who had previously bid at that price.” They supposed that they had this power because the charter provided for the publication of notice to the lot owners to do the work within a reasonable time, before the street commissioners should be authorized to let the work on contract; “and if said work be not done within the time limited in such contract the said commissioners may relet such' work without further, notice.” . This action was brought to restrain the sale of the plaintiff’s lot on the assessment for the work done under that contraction the ground that the assessment was void.

The true inquiry is, is it the natural tendency of such an agreement to injuriously influence the public interests? The rule is, that agreements which in their necessary operation upon the action of the parties to them tend to restrain their natural rivalry and competition, and thus result to the disadvantage of the public, or of third parties, are against the principles of sound policy and are void. * * The object and policy of the statute was to be achieved only by exciting the rivalry and competition of men seeking this privilege. This competition was to be excited by calling by advertisement for sealed and secret proposals. Each bidder, ignorant of what his rival was about to offer, would be under stimulus to make a bid at the best rate to the town which his judgment would sanction as of profit to himself. * * * Where an agreement is made between bidders to share in the acceptance of the offer of either, it is apparent that the competition must materially slacken. Each of those parties had intended to make a proposal on his own account, and it was after each knew of the other’s intention that the agreement between them was proposed <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>and entered into. Until it can be truthfully said that men’s actions will not be affected by a consideration of their self-interest, it cannot be maintained that the parties to this agreement were likely, after it was formed, to be as strong competitors as they were before. Such is the natural effect of agreements of this nature; and it is for this reason and not on account of the natural results upon the public or upon third persons, of particular contracts that they are held void. It is because men, with these agreements in their hands, and relying upon them for their gain, do not act toward the public and third persons as they would without them, under the stimulus of competing opposition.”</p>

If it were presented as a legal question to be authoritatively decided, and not as the ground for an injunction addressed to the sound discretion of a Chancellor, I would hesitate to say that there was such want or defect of notice of the biddings as should deprive the contractors of the benefits of the contract, after they had given bond, made expensive preparations and partly performed the work. All the notice had been given by the first advertisment which the policy of the act required. It is the general rule, on all sides concede^, that public <em>sales </em>may be postponed to another day, if from any cause the sale on the appointed day be prevented, provided sufficient notice of the future day be then and there given; and the original advertisement, if well made, will suffice. The authorities on this point, as shown by brief of appellant’s counsel, are numerous. It is difficult to see any difference, in principles, between sales by authority of law and the letting of public contracts.</p>

All the bids were rejected, and proceedings by advertisment begun <em>ah initio. </em>There was no express warranty for that, nor was thete any express prohibition, but there was general authority to “let anew,” and there is n,o room to doubt that all the bidders were at the time, advised ..of the aotion of the Board <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>It was not prescribed wbat advertisement should be given in such contingency, or that any should. The original notice and advertisment required by law had already been given, and had served all the beneficial purpose oí inv’ting competition. Every bidder had the privilege oí keeping his bid <em>in statu, </em>by renewing it, or of altering his bid to be more acceptable. The State had all that benefit, with the additional advantage of an increased competition. The contract awarded was at fair prices. So much is shown. This cannot, except in mere form, be distinguished from a case of postponement. The State had every chance of advantage, and is not shown to have been injured. Nor, independently of motives prompting caution, in the issuance of an injunction (to thwart the express directions of the General Assembly contained -in a solemn act), would I be prepared to hold as a governing principle, that a combination of individuals to bid jointly in the name of one for a public contract, if made openly, frankly, and for honest purposes of their own profit and convenience, without any artifice to suppress competition in others, is so much against public policy as to render the contract voidable, at tbe arbitrary will of the other party, without the proof of some detriment or loss. There are some cases which seem to go to that extent, especially in the State of New York; but there are many <em>per contra, </em>in other States, especially in the States of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. It seems to me the latter cases are based upon sounder and higher views of public policy, individual liberty, and the requirements of modern enterprise. Business has undergone great changes in its modes and appliances within the last hundred years. The magnitude and difficulties of modern works require aggregation of individual means; and it may be that the greater facilities for their accomplishment, thus afforded, may enable companies and associations to undertake them at <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>lower rates. A rule which would exclude such combinations, compelling individuals to compete with each other, would not only be an invasion of individual rights, but very questionable policy. I imagine the true and rational inquiry to be this : Not whether two or more agreed that one should bid for the common benefit, but was the association for honest and just purposes, free of fraud, without any artifice, concealment or practice to suppress competition on the part of others ? and for the purpose of enabling two members to do jointly what they could not so well do separately ? , If so, it should certainly be upheld. Such is the view of Mr. Story in his work on contracts. (Sec. 548, citing the authorities).</p>
    <p id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.5",270,[375,1136,1130,1116]],["BL_271.1",271,[132,377,1126,109]]]'>As this case stands upon the proof in the transcript, leaving out of view the unsupported allegations of the answer, T must confess I see nothing in the agreement of a fraudulent character or that militates against a sound public policy. Four firms, or offices, had bidden separately. None had been accepted. Not because they were, so far as appears, any of them unfair, but because the Board could not determine which was lowest. They then openly, without any concealment, with full knowledge of the board, as appears in proof, settled amongst themselves a tariff of rates upon which they could all agree, and put it in jointly, but in the name of one. This bid was open to competition by all the printers in the State, who had bid or might wish to come in on the extended time. We cannot presume there were no others. There is nothing to show that these contractors used any artifice, practice or means whatever; or meant to suppress such competition. I am not clear that this, and this as yet is all we can see, was against public policy. The General Assembly did not make any complaint of the contract as fraudulent or unfair, or impolitic; nor did the Chancellor make that any ground of his <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>decision. If it is to be considered of importance’in refusing the injunction, I think the case should be remanded.</p>
    <p id="b271-5" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[134,493,1130,502]]]'>Whether the Attorney General might be able by proof, to sustain his allegations in full, I cannot foretell. The case went off below on another point, which being settled dispensed with proof as <em>to </em>fraud or improper practice. It would be well, being a public matter and peculiar, to remand it for further proof as to fraud. Nevertheless, as my associates do not share these views, but think the Chancellor right in refusing the injunction upon the case as made, I do not, for the reasons first stated, refuse my assent.</p>

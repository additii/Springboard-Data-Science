J. Myers, appellant, on the 23d day of February, 1925, secured an existing indebtedness of $5,382.56, by said appellee to said appellant, for money advanced by appellant to it to operate its lumber business in Harrison, Arkansas. Between the dates of October 24, 1924, and February 23, 1925, appellee borrowed on open account from appellant $8,310.56 to operate its business, and paid appellant on said indebtedness during said period $2,927.99, leaving a balance due appellee on book account of $5,382.56. Appellee was uniable to pay the indebtedness, and needed additional money from time to time to operate its business. Appellant was willing, if secured, to make further advances to appellee for such purpose, pro<a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>vided appellant’s son was employed to manage the business, except the actual operation of the mill, which W.

It is unnecessary to determine the correctness of the construction placed upon the mortgage by the trial court, to the effect that it did not secure advances after the maturity of the mortgage, since all the advances made after maturity were paid during the operation of the business and before this suit was instituted. The payment of the advances eliminated that question.</p>
    <p id="b197-4" data-blocks='[["BL_197.5",197,[189,966,1197,1406]]]'>We cannot agree with the trial court’s construction of the mortgage, that it was not intended to and did not secure the book account which appellee owed appellant at the time of the execution of the mortgage and contract. The mortgage recites that it was executed to secure a note of $10,000 of even date, which seenis not to have been executed, and does not refer specifically to the book account. Certainly the mortgage and contract were executed to secure an indebtedness. According to the interpretation of the trial court, it was executed without any purpose or intent to secure any indebtedness, its execution being an idle ceremony. The only existing indebtedness at the time was the book account. The defeasance clause in the mortgage indicates very clearly that the purpose of its execution was to secure an indebtedness then existing. There can be no question that the purpose and intent was to execute a note for $10,000 to secure an indebtedness for that amount. As the only indebtedness then existing was the book account, it is quite apparent that the note was intended to include that sum, and a reading of the mortgage, in connection with the contract providing for a continuation of the business, indicates very clearly that the $10,000 note which was to be executed should also embrace future advances. The mortgage provided that, during the continuation of the business, all machinery and equipment which should be purchased was to be included in the mortgage as security for the indebtedness.</p>

W. 606</a>, as decisive of its contention that the book account was not sufficiently identified in the mortgage to be secured thereby. In the case cited the mortgage described an $80.02 note of even date therewith, and did not mention two notes executed prior thereto. The mortgage contained a defeasance clause which recited that, oh payment of the note, together with all other indebtedness which may be due, the mortgage should be void. The court ruled that the defeasance clause related to ¡and secured only indebtedness created by additional advances and not to the indebtedness evidenced by the prior notes. In the case cited the $80.02 note was actually executed and was of even date with the mortgage, and the prior notes were not mentioned. Future advances were mentioned. The distinction between that case and this is that no note was executed in the instant case. There was no note to be secured specifically mentioned as in the case cited. In the instant case an indebtedness was to be secured which was to be covered in a $10,000 note. The only indebtedness existing at the time was a book account, and necessarily wias the indebtedness which was to be covered by or embraced in the note. This court ruled in the case of <em>Carnall </em>v. <em>Duval, </em><a href="/ark/22/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="22 Ark. 136" data-case-ids="8725862" data-case-paths="/ark/22/0136-01">22 Ark. 136</a>, that: “It is no objection to the validity of a mortgage, if given to secure an existing debt, that such debt is not evidenced by a note or bond, nor that a specified time is not limited for its becoming absolute, or for its foreclosure.”</p>

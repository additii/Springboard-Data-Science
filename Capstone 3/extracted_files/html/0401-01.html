It is insisted that said instruction No. 1, given for appellee, is erroneous in that it required a higher degree of care to be exercised by the motorman in proportion to the greater danger to be avoided than the law warrants. Said instruction reads as follows: ‘ ‘ The court instructs the jury that the defendant in the operation of its street cars in the city of Little Bock over and across streets that people are constantly traveling over, it is the duty of the operatives of the said street car to exercise due care. The operators must be governed to some extent by the circumstances that surround them at the various street crossing’s along their line. And, if you find from the evidence that- there was a building on the east side of said street ear track and south of 23d Street, and was built and situated so that the view to said 23d Street was cut off and obstructed, so that the operatives of said street car could not see an automobile approaching said ear line from the east until said automobile was near or upon said tracks, then the operatives of said street cars traveling north and approaching said 23d Street crossing would be required to exercise a higher degree of care in proportion to the greater danger; and the operatives of said street car should reduce the speed of said street car or take other precaution, so as to have their street car under such control as would enable them to avoid dangers and injuries to others using or traveling over said tracks at said crossing. ’ ’</p>

W. 157</a>, it is said: “The degree of care varies with the circumstances of each ease, and necessarily depends upon the hazard or danger. It would not he improper to say that a greater degree of care should be exercised when the situation or circumstances is more dangerous or hazardous. Under such circumstances, a reasonably prudent and cautious person would exercise greater care than when the situation involved less or no danger. The exercise of the greater care, under more dangerous and hazardous circumstances, would therefore only be the exercise of that care which a reasonably prudent and cautious person would exercise under similar circumstances, and would therefore be at last only ordinary care. And this, we think, is but the meaning and effect of the instruction given.” See also <em>Bona </em>v. <em>Thomas Auto Co., </em><a href="/citations/?q=137%20Ark.%20224" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="137 Ark. 224">137 Ark. 224</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20S.W.%20306" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="208 S.W. 306">208 S.

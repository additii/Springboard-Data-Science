The Bank Commissioner took the position that there was no legal authority for an amendment of the character proposed, and refused to entertain the application or to make any formal ruling on the merits thereof. Thereupon a petition for mandamus was filed in the second division of the Pulaski Circuit Court to compel the Bank Commissioner to exercise his discretion by passing upon the merits of the proposed amendment bearing upon the welfare of the bank, its stockholders and creditors, and to make a ruling either allowing or rejecting the proposed amendment.

The first point made is that it authorized the conversion of outstanding stock subject to an assessment to the amount of 100 per cent, of its face value into non-assessable and single liability stock whereby the rights of existing creditors are impaired and results in the violation of the obligation of the contract, and depriving them of their property without due process of law within the meaning of the National and State. Constitutions prohibiting legislation of that character. It is contended that an analysis of § 2 shows that it specifically authorizes the conversion of outstanding assessable stock into nonassessable stock and contains no provision safeguarding the rights of creditors who hold obligations of the bank <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>antedating the passage of the act, and thus extinguishes the stockholders’ liability to creditors of the bank then existing, and that there is no language in the act subsequent to § 2 which, properly construed, protects the creditors in their rights against the stockholders, existing prior to the enactment of act No. 15.</p>
    <p id="b365-3" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[170,665,1202,1747]]]'>Section 2 consists of one long and involved paragraph, but there is no unsurmountable difficulty in arriving at its meaning. It simply provides that any bank or trust company then or thereafter organized, where withdrawal of its demand deposits shall have been restricted or where they may have been taken in charge by the Bank Commissioner, either for liquidation or management under existing laws, and if the corporation shall be reorganized by the removal of all restrictions on the withdrawal of its deposits except such as are expressly agreed to by the depositors, or where the Bank Commissioner’s charge for purposes of liquidation or management shall have been terminated, or where as a successor to it another bank or trust company shall be organized assuming in whole or in part its deposit liabilities, then, in either event, where the action is authorized in the original articles of agreement or so authorized «by amendment to the articles (the amendment to be submitted to and approved by the Bank Commissioner) all or part of the capital stock outstanding may be converted and the issuance of other shares may be authorized, which converted stock and such as is newly issued shall not “subject the owners thereof to any liability either to restore the capital or said respective bank or trust company, or, in addition to the amounts invested therein, for any of its debts, contracts or engagements.” The meaning of the language quoted is obscure, and if, as contended by the appellant, it relieves the stock of the banks existing prior to the passage of the act from assessment for the benefit of then existing creditors, it might be deemed as an impairment of the obligation of the contract existing between the bank and its creditor, and, for that reason, void on constitutional grounds.</p>
    <p id="b366-2" data-blocks='[["BL_366.3",366,[286,330,1202,1045]]]'>
      <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>It is well settled that a statute ought to he construed so that its validity be upheld, if any reasonable interpretation of its language justifies that action, and, where the language is of doubtful import, the entire act should be looked to. Under these settled canons of construction, when we examine § 2-A in connection with the part of the act challenged and quoted, <em>supra, </em>it is apparent that the Legislature was dealing with the stockholders’ liability with respect to debts of the bank contracted after the passage of the act and was not intended to, and did not, relieve the owners of stock in any existing banking institution from liability with relation to debts which the bank owed at that time, either to depositors or any other class of creditors. We think there can be no mistake as to what the Legislature intended, for by § 2-A it provided that “when bank stock is converted as provided for in § 2, nothing in this act- shall be construed as to relieve in any manner the double liability existing against owners of stock in old banks and/or trust companies in which the stock is being converted.”</p>
    <p id="b366-3" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[286,1398,1202,1061]]]'>The appellee correctly interprets the statute to mean, when §§ 2 and '2-A are read together, that holders of converted stock are not subject to double liability in respect thereof, but that those who were holders of stock subject to a double liability are not relieved therefrom, and continue subject to assessment to 100 per cent, of the par value of the stock outstanding on the date of the act for the satisfaction of the debts of the bank or trust company contracted prior to the conversion, even though such stock may have been converted into nonassessable stock in a new organization. The liability on the stock of a bank or trust company, existing at the time of the passage of the act, would remain and continue, even though the liability had not been fixed by the levy of any assessment against the stock. Therefore, since the act of conversion of stock in an existing bank into stock of a new organization does not in any degree affect any liability for debts then existing, it could not, and does not, deprive any such creditor of any rights, and does not violate the obligation of a contract or deprive the creditor of his property without duo process of law.</p>

      <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>The next .point made is that the act violates the' same constitutional provisions because it may lessen the value of the shares of a common stockholder without his consent by reason of the issuance of preferred stock authorized by the act. This is the only objection to the validity of the act about which, in our opinion, there can be any question. It is contended that, where a corporation is created with common stock only, an implied contract exists between the corporators that the net profits of the corporation will be divided among the holders of such common stock in proportion to their ownership of shares; and, if thereafter preferred stock is issued, the result would be that the owners of common stock would not participate in the profits as intended, but their rights would be deferred to the preferred stock, and their profits diminished by the amount of dividends paid the same; and that therefore, unless the charter itself reserved the power of issuing preferred stock, the unanimous consent of the holders of common stock is necessary to validate such issue, and that, as the charter of the appellee bank did not reserve the right to issue preferred stock, the act is invalid because it permits the same to be done by a mere majority of the stockholders.</p>

In that case there were two questions, one as to the power of the corporation, without the assent of all its shareholders, to increase the amount of its capital stock, and the other, as to the right of the corporation to issue preferred stock and compel its substitution for present outstanding common stock without the consent of all the shareholders. In holding that the corporation could do neither, because it would be an impairment of the obligation of contract, the court cited the case of <em>Chicago City Ry. </em>v. <em>Allerton, </em>18 Wall. (U. S.) 233, as authority for its conclusion. That case is not authority for the point decided in <em>Einstein </em>v. <em>Raritan, etc., supra, </em>for there the only question was as to the power of the board of directors, acting alone to increase the capital <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>stock" without the matter being submitted to, and approved by, the stockholders, and the only authority claimed was the provision in the charter “that the corporate powers of said corporation shall be vested in, and exercised by, a board of directors,” etc. The court held that this was no authority for the act complained of, since that provision in the charter authorized the performance merely of the. ordinary business transactions of the corporation and did not extend to a reconstruction of the body itself, or to an enlargement of its capital stock. The doctrine of the case of <em>Einstein </em>v. <em>Raritanm, supra, </em>was reaffirmed in the case of <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Francisco Sugar Co., </em><a href="/nj-eq/92/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="92 N.J.

There are other decisions which apparently deny the right of the State to alter the contract of the stockholders as between themselves by statute passed after the formation of the corporation, but, in those States in which the power is reserved to alter or amend charters of corporations, it seems that such legislation is upheld and, in general,. that the charter may be altered so as to impose greater burdens on .the stockholders than were imposed at the time the charter was granted or makes possible a diminution in the value of their shares, where such alteration does not involve a confiscation of the rights of the individuals, deprive them of their property without due process of law, or violate the elementary principles of natural justice.

The court, in overruling both contentions, said: ‘ <em>‘ </em>Every objection urged by appellants against the constitutionality of the acts finds an answer in the fact that a corporation accepts its charter powers subject to the reserved right in the State to alter or re<a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>voke <em>the </em>charter whenever, in the opinion of the General Assembly, such revocation or alteration is for the protection of the citizens of the State, if done in such a manner that no injustice may be done to the corporators.

It may also be said that, since an act of the General Assembly passed at its 1905 session, every corporation organized under the laws of this State by virtue of said act has had the power to issue preferred stock, either where the right was expressed by certificate of incorporation or in an amendment thereof. The provision of the act is § 1703 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, which is that “Every corporation organized under the laws of the State of Arkansas shall have power to issue preferred stock with such preferences and voting powers and restrictions or qualifications therein as shall be stated and expressed in certificate of incorporation, or in any certificate of amendment thereof.”</p>

The particular complaint made is that, under the act, the issuance of non-assessable stock will be ‘ ‘ executed, submitted to, and approved by, the Bank Commissioner, and filed with the county clerk, all in a manner and form as now provided by law.” The answer to this is that the statute is original in form, and by its own language grants powers, confers rights and creates burdens or obligations, and the reference to existing laws is for the' purpose of pointing out the procedure in executing the power, en<a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>forcing the right, or discharging the duty. <em>Farris </em>v. <em>Wright, </em><a href="/ark/158/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="158 Ark. 519" data-case-ids="1355735" data-case-paths="/ark/158/0519-01">158 Ark. 519</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=250%20S.W.%20889" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="250 S.W. 889">250 S.

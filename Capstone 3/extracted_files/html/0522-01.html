    <p id="b542-9" data-blocks='[["BL_542.14",542,[297,1278,1199,299]]]'>The record reflects that notices of the intention to file the petition for consolidation of said school districts with the county board of education were not posted thirty days before but thirty days after filing the petition. The statute governing the notices to be posted is found in § 8821 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, and is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="AbX" data-blocks='[["BL_542.15",542,[290,1590,1204,450]]]'>“When a change is proposed in any school district, notice shall be given by parties proposing the change by putting up hand-bills in four or more conspicuous places in each district to be affected, one of said notices to be placed on the public school building in each affected district. All of said notices to be posted thirty days before the convening of the court to which they propose to present their petition. Said notices shall give a geographical description of the proposed change.”</blockquote>

It is argued in appellants ’ reply brief very earnestly that the court should recede from the interpretation placed upon the statute in the case'referred to, but the court is of opinion that it correctly construed the statute and adheres to the construction placed upon it in that case.</p>

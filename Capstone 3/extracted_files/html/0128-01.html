Officer Campbell asked Mecham to perform field sobriety tests (FSTs), which would have involved Officer Campbell’s observing Mecham’s eye movements and ability to walk a straight line and stand on one leg. Mecham refused, and his refusal was used against him at trial.

While at a stoplight, Officer Campbell ran a random license check on Mecham’s vehicle and discovered an outstanding warrant. He then turned on his emergency lights, and Mecham pulled over by turning into a parking lot. The stop was purely for the outstanding warrant; Officer Campbell did not notice anything unsafe about the manner in which Mecham was driving.</p>

He also observed an open beer can with a straw behind the passenger seat of Mecham’s vehicle.

First, in the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, the suspect driver must follow a moving object with the eyes while the officer looks for involuntary eye movements. Second, in the walk-and-turn test, the suspect driver must take several heel-to-toe steps in a line. The third test requires the suspect driver to stand on one leg while counting out loud. These tests are specifically designed to provide statistically valid and reliable indications of a driver’s blood alcohol content (BAC) and “are usable only for a sobriety determination.” <em>Heinemann v.

With Officer Moore’s help, Officer Campbell drafted an application for—and received—a search warrant authorizing a blood draw to test Mecham’s BAC. Officer Campbell transported Mecham to Overlake Hospital Medical Center, and the blood draw was completed just short of three hours after Mecham’s initial arrest. A forensic toxicologist analyzed the blood and reported that Mecham’s BAC was 0.05 grams per 100 milliliters (g/100 ml). This toxicologist testified that given the passage of time and the rate at which alcohol is metabolized, Mecham’s BAC was likely 0.065 g/100 ml within two hours after he stopped driving and possibly as high as 0.08 g/100 ml. The State charged Mecham with one count of felony driving under the influence (DUI).</p>

More importantly, Officer Campbell did not discover the justification for the FSTs until after Mecham was already under formal arrest, a point the lead opinion acknowledges but does not address. <em>See </em>lead opinion at 131 <em>(“Following </em>arrest, Officer Campbell smelled intoxicants on Mecham’s breath and noticed that Mecham’s movements were sluggish and that <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>his speech was slurred and repetitive.” (emphasis added)). Thus, the <em>Terry </em>analysis, if applicable at all, must begin anew at the time the officer formed his suspicion that Mecham was intoxicated. Even here, under normal circumstances, I believe there would be sufficient facts to justify an extension of the traffic stop under <em>Terry. </em>However, the situation presents a unique problem because Mecham was formally arrested for a <em>different </em>offense both when the officer formed his suspicion that Mecham was driving impaired as well as when the officer requested that Mecham perform the FSTs.</p>

In doing so, the lead opinion loses track of the fundamental nature of what this case concerns—that is, a citizen’s right to choose to do something or not. The officer here requested that the defendant perform specific voluntary actions, which the defendant chose not to do. For the principles of voluntariness or consent to have any meaning, the only conclusion flowing from this choice is simply that—a choice was made. No evidentiary relevance should flow from this choice. The conviction should be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">15</a>

The evidence was challenged on appeal. The essence of the reasoning of these cases is that, since the tests are voluntary, when a person consents to performing the tests, he or she is bound to that choice, good or bad. Moreover, no logical or legal sense exists for those cases to even analyze consent and uphold the admissibility of evidence at trial outside the context of a “search.” Those cases have little, if any, relevance here except the recognition that a person possesses the right to choose and that when valid consent to a search exists, the results are admissible.</p>

Perhaps the statute could be revised to include FSTs and consequences of refusal, but the legislature has not acted to do so.

The answer depends on the facts: if such an FST search is reasonable to protect officer or public safety, then it is constitutionally permissible under <em>Terry, </em>but if such an FST search does not further any legitimate, immediate safety need, then it is constitutionally impermissible under <em>Terry. </em>In this case, Mecham was already handcuffed, removed from his car, and placed under arrest for a separate and unrelated crime before the FSTs were requested. Thus, officer and public safety were fully protected at that point; the FSTs would have served only an evidence-gathering purpose, not the safety purpose of getting a potentially dangerous driver off the road. Because the State has not shown that the <em>Terry </em>safety exception or any other exceptions to the warrant requirement applied in this case, I dissent.</p>

        <em> </em>The lead opinion mistakenly asserts that Washington’s constitution (article I, section 7) is <em>always </em>“unconcerned with the reasonableness of the search’’ in question. Lead opinion at 140. On the contrary, whether “reasonableness” factors into our state constitutional analysis depends on the government’s justification for the search. Where an officer asserts only a “reasonable [but erroneous] good faith belief” that he or she had permission to conduct a warrantless search, we depart from Fourth Amendment analysis and hold that the reasonableness of the officer’s belief is irrelevant. <em>State v.

It does not address a defendant’s refusal to comply with an <em>unlawful </em>order, even one that is unlawful only under the common law. I also note that the arresting officer here specifically told Mecham that the PSTs were “voluntary.’’ Lead opinion at 132. To the extent that Mecham reasonably relied on this statement when he declined to perform the tests, then, regardless of the source of the right to refuse, estoppel principles arguably bar the State from using that decision against Mecham at trial. <em>See, e.g., State v.

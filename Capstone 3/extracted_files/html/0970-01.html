    <p id="b993-6" data-blocks='[["BL_993.7",993,[176,1476,1207,866]]]'>Appellant calls attention to, and relies on, <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em><a href="/njl/98/0730-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="98 N.J.L. 730" data-case-ids="201835" data-case-paths="/njl/98/0730-01">98 N.

In that case the truck of the Standard Oil Company was parked on the wrong side of the street in violation of the traffic law, and a little girl nine years old ran out from behind the truck and was struck by a passing automobile. Suit was brought against the driver of the car and the Standard Oil Company and another. There was a verdict in favor of the driver of the automobile, and against the other defendants. It was not alleged in that case that there was any violation of the traffic laws by the Standard Oil Company, except the mere parking on the wrong side of the street. There was ample space for other vehicles, and the court held that the parking of the truck did not <em>per se </em>constitute negligence upon the owner of the truck so as to subject him to liability as an efficient proximate cause.</p>
    <p id="b994-2" data-blocks='[["BL_994.3",994,[269,357,1206,756]]]'>
      <a id="p974" href="#p974" data-label="974" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*974</a>Appellant says that the truck did not extend more than four or five feet on the hard surface of the roadbed, and that this left at least 17 .feet of roadway remaining. If the roadway is to be considered 22 feet wide, and the truck'was five feet on the hard surface, then it was at least nine feet in the road, and that would only leave 13 feet if the entire roadbed was included, rather than the hard surface. In any event 15 feet required by law was not left. In the above case relied on by appellants, there was no question of an obstruction of the highway, but the only allegation was that the truck was parked on the wrong side of the street. It was not claimed in that case that the highway was so obstructed that there was not ample room to pass. Moreover, it was held that the injured party there was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>
    <p id="b994-3" data-blocks='[["BL_994.4",994,[270,1135,1202,196]]]'>In the instant case, whether the appellee was guilty of contributory negligence was a question of fact to be determined by the jury, and its verdict is not without evidence to support it.</p>

Where concurrent negligence is alleged, the general rule is stated as follows: “As a general rule, it may be said that negligence, to render a person liable, need not be the sole cause of an injury. It is sufficient that his negligence concurring with one or more efficient causes, other than plaintiff’s fault, is the proximate cause of the injury.. So that where several causes combine to produce injuries, a person is not relieved from liability because he is responsible for only one of them, it being sufficient that his negligence is an efficient cause without which the injury would not have resulted to as great an extent, and that such other cause is not attributable to the person injured. But it must appear that the person sought to be charged was responsible for one of the causes which resulted in the injury. The concurring negligence of another cannot transform the remote into the proximate <a id="p975" href="#p975" data-label="975" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*975</a>cause of au injury, or create or increase liabilities therefor.” 45 C. J. 920.</p>
    <p id="b995-3" data-blocks='[["BL_995.4",995,[179,479,1204,503]]]'>There was ample evidence to support the -finding of the jury that the injury to appellee would not have occurred if the truck had not been so parked as to obstruct the highway. If it did obstruct the highway when parked there, and this obstruction was negligence, it was a continuing act of negligence up to the time of the injury, and whether it was negligence, and whether the injury would not have occurred but for this negligence, were questions for the jury. <em>Helena Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em><a href="/ark/104/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="104 Ark. 59" data-case-ids="1350646" data-case-paths="/ark/104/0059-01">104 Ark. 59</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=147%20S.W.%20473" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="147 S.W. 473">147 S.

They rather adopt the practical rule that the efficient and predominating cause in producing a given effect or result, though subordinate and dependent causes may have operated, must be looked to in determining the rights and liabilities of the parties.” <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Ormsby, </em><a href="/ind-app/45/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="45 Ind.

There was in that case, however, no question of concurrent negligence, but the Boston Store, the defendant, undertook to escape liability by showing that the condition existing at the time and place was the proximate cause of the injury. The court in that case however said: “There are three essential elements in actionable negligence: First, a duty imposed by law to exercise care in favor of the person for whose benefit the duty is imposed; second, the failure to perform that duty; and third, a consequence so connected 'with the failure to <a id="p976" href="#p976" data-label="976" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*976</a>perform the duty that the failure is the proximate cause of the injury.”</p>
    <p id="b996-3" data-blocks='[["BL_996.4",996,[293,474,1203,403]]]'>In the instant case there can be no question about the duty being imposed by law, nor can there be any dispute about the fact that it was for the benefit of persons using the highway. The undisputed proof shows that there was a failure to perform that duty, and there was substantial evidence to show that the injury would not have happened but for the failure to perform its duty by appellant.</p>
    <p id="b996-4" data-blocks='[["BL_996.5",996,[292,884,1204,610]]]'>Appellant also calls attention to <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; O. R.

The court however said in that case: “The causal connection between the first act of negligence and the injury is broken by the intervention of an act of a responsible party, which act is in law regarded as the sole cause of the injury.” In the instant case the causal connection was not broken. The negligence of the appellant continued and existed as long as its truck remained on the highway in violation of law, and it was its negligence together with the negligence of the driver of the automobile, that caused the injury.</p>
    <p id="b996-5" data-blocks='[["BL_996.6",996,[291,1499,1204,507]]]'>It is next contended that appellee was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. The undisputed proof shows that he started across the highway, and before he started he looked to see if a car was coming, and, as he proceeded to cross the highway, the car driven by Carter struck the truck and then struck appellee, causing the injury. Contributory negligence, under the circumstances, was a question of fact for the jury, and this question was submitted to the jury by the court, and the finding of the jury on this question is conclusive here.</p>

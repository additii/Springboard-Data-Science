That statute reads, “A person is guilty of possession of a stolen vehicle if he or she possess [possesses] a stolen motor vehicle.” RCW 9A.56.068(1) (alteration in original). Porter argues that the information is deficient because it does not contain the statutory definition of “possess.” Suppl. Br. of Resp’t at 4-5.

The fact that “possession” is more precisely defined in a way that might vindicate someone who unwittingly possesses the stolen property and thus does not withhold it from the true owner does not <em>add </em>to the essential elements of RCW 9A.56.068.

Suppl. Br. of Resp’t at 6-7. Porter cites no authority—binding, persuasive, or otherwise—to support his argument that charging documents must mirror pattern to-convict jury instructions. And for good reason: charging documents and jury instructions serve very different purposes. Jury instructions “allow [ ] each party to argue its theory of the case” and “must convey to the jury that the State bears the burden of proving every essential element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt.” <em>State v.

In <em>Moavenzadeh, </em>this court reversed a defendant’s conviction when an information charging three counts of first degree possession of stolen property “contain[ed] no language which cfould] fairly be read to allege that [the defendant] knew the property was stolen.” 135 Wn.2d at 363. Overruling prior cases, the court held that the knowledge element of possession of stolen property is an essential element. <em>Id. </em>at 363-64. Here, the charging document clearly put Porter on notice that he was being charged for “possess[ing] a stolen motor vehicle, knowing that it had been stolen.” CP at 1. Further elaboration of how a person may “possess” stolen property was unnecessary. And although this court in <em>McKinsey </em>included the words “withhold or appropriate” in setting out the elements of the crime that must be proved, it did not announce them as <em>essential </em>elements of the crime for charging purposes. 116 Wn.2d at 913. Instead, the issue in <em>McKinsey </em>was whether possession of stolen property is a crime of dishonesty admissible for impeachment purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 912. <em>McKinsey </em>does not <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>undercut the clear holding in <em>Johnson </em>recognizing that not all aspects of proof that are necessary at trial constitute essential elements that must be included in the information. <em>Johnson, </em>180 Wn.2d at 301-02.</p>

    <p id="b132-5" data-blocks='[["BL_132.5",132,[202,703,1247,367]]]'>¶17 Liberally construed, the charging document included all essential elements of the crime of possession of a stolen motor vehicle. The State was not required to include the definitional element of “possess” to properly charge Porter. Accordingly, we reinstate Porter’s conviction for unlawful possession of a stolen motor vehicle and remand to the Court of Appeals to address Porter’s remaining claims.</p>

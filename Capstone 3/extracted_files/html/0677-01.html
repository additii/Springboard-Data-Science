Over the objection of appellants, the court permitted appellees to introduce the contract and supplemental contract between the original contractor and road district, the contract between the original contractor and appellees, and the original plans and specifications for the construction of the road, all of which are referred to in the contract between Sanford and ap-pellees. Under the original plans and specifications, made a part of the contract between 'Sanford and ap-pellees, the district reserved the right to make any changes in the width of the road and method of construction thereof so as to meet Federal aid requirements, and it was provided in said specifications that “no allowance would he made for anticipated profits” in case such changes were made. The specifications also vested in the engineer of the district the right to determine the amount 'and quality of the work, and provided that the contractors should be paid only upon the estimates of said engineer. The specifications also provided that, in case the work was suspended by the engineer or directors of the district, on account of weather conditions or other cause, an extension of time should be granted for the completion of the work greater than the delay occasioned by the suspension. The specifications also provided for temporary suspension of the work. Section 59 of the specifications is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b708-3" data-blocks='[["BL_708.4",708,[286,1847,1205,560]],["BL_709.1",709,[218,411,1205,90]]]'>“The directors or engineer may stop the work wholly, or in part, for such period or periods as they may deem necessary because of unsuitable weather or such other conditions as are considered unfavorable for the prosecution of the work, or for such time as they may consider necessary because of the failure on the part of the contractor to carry out orders given. If work is suspended, the contractor shall place the materials and equipment in neat piles, protected from the elements, so as to avoid obstruction of traffic. No allowance of any kind will be made for such suspension of <a id="p683" href="#p683" data-label="683" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*683</a>work except an extension of time for 'completion of the contract.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b709-3" data-blocks='[["BL_709.4",709,[208,522,1215,1583]]]'>Appellant’s insistence for a reversal of the judgment is that the trial court erred in holding that appellants were bound by section 59 of the plans and specifications quoted above. It is admitted that, if bound by said section, the court correctly admitted the plans, specifications, and contracts in evidence. Appellants contend, however, that the reference made to the plans and specifications in the contract was for the sole purpose of indicating when work was to be done and the •manner of doing same. We cannot agree with learned counsel in thus restricting the reference. Reference was first made to the original contracts, and the only purpose which can be attributed to such reference is that the origiilal contracts were intended by the parties as a basis for the subcontract. Reference was next made to the original plans and specifications by making them a part of the subcontract. The language bound Sanford to “perform each and every act as called for in the specifications.” We think this meant that Sanford should be bound as completely by the provisions contained in the specifications as the original. contractor, so far as that portion of the road is concerned which he agreed to build. It is undisputed that the work was suspended from time to time by order of the engineer. It does not appear that the suspensions were arbitrarily made. Changes were made in the width and construction of the road to meet Federal aid requirements, and on this account the time was extended by supplemental contract for the completion of the road. The court correctly construed the contract, and, under the undisputed facts, properly directed a verdict for appellees.</p>

The court said in that case: “By act of the General Assembly, <em>supra, </em>any corporation organized for the purpose of generating, transmitting and supplying electricity for public use was permitted to construct its lines over the public highways. Therefore appellant’s rights to the use of the highway running through the village stands upon a different footing to its occupancy of the streets. Appellant rightfully used the highway for the erection of its lines and was rightfully using it at the time the municipality was formed. The statute, however, did not give it, or any other company of like character, the exclusive privilege, but any other company incorporated for a similar purpose or as many as might be formed might use the same highway, the only limitation to such use with respect to the appellant being that occupancy ought not to be allowed to injure or interfere with the physical property of the appellant.”</p>

W. 678</a>, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 539, and quotes at length from the opinion in this case. The Iowa case, however, is construing a State statute which expressly authorized persons to construct telephone or telegraph lines along the highways of the State and erect the necessary fixtures, and the court said: “Now, the primary question in the case is whether or not by the enactment of these laws, commencing with the act passed in the year 1888 and ending with those appearing in the Code of 1897, the Legislature intended thereby to forfeit the rights already acquired by a telephone company under § 13'24 of the Code of 1873, as amended by the acts of the nineteenth General Assembly, and to require such a company already occupying the streets and alleys of a city to secure through action of the city council and by a referendum vote the right to use the streets and alleys upon which it had already placed its poles and lines <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>under specific authority from the Legislature; or was it the intent of the Legislature to authorize cities to regulate such companies as were already using the streets and alleys under the grant of the Legislature, and all others which might secure the right to so use the streets and alleys, by general and uniform legislation applicable to all, and to further provide that no franchise to use the streets and alleys should thereafter be granted, renewed, or extended, except upon a referendum vote of the people. It seems clear to us that the latter is the proper interpretation to be put upon these laws. It must be remembered that the franchise spoken of is not the general franchise of a corporation, domestic or otherwise, granted by a sovereign, but a franchise for the streets, alleys, etc., of the city. The latter the defendant had directly from the Legislature, and, as we have seen, it was perpetual in character, subject, if at all, to forfeiture by the Legislature itself. It did not need to be renewed or extended; and, having one already, no further grant was necessary.”</p>
    <p id="b64-3" data-blocks='[["BL_64.4",64,[264,1333,1201,443]]]'>In Iowa, at the time the telephone company erected its poles and system, there was no provision for municipalities granting a franchise to such company, but the franchise was granted by the State of Iowa, and it included the right to operate on all public highways, which included streets of cities and towns in Iowa at that time. The only question in the Iowa case was whether the subsequent legislation forfeited the franchise of the telephone company.</p>
    <p id="b64-4" data-blocks='[["BL_64.5",64,[260,1783,1200,286]]]'>We have no such question here. The Arkansas statute does not undertake to give the right to appellant and other companies to occupy the streets and alleys of incorporated towns, but expressly provides that the permission of municipal authorities shall be had in order to do that.</p>
    <p id="b64-5" data-blocks='[["BL_64.6",64,[257,2090,1199,347]]]'>The Iowa case was by a divided court, and a dissenting opinion was written by Judge Weaver, which was concurred in by Judge Preston. However, the Iowa case is not applicable here because, under the Iowa statute, the Legislature granted the franchise, and not the municipality, and under our statute the municipality must grant the right.</p>

That case, however, was decided by the Federal District Court, and it was there stated that the Supreme Court of Iowa had passed directly upon the question, and that it was the duty of the Federal court to accept the decision of the highest court of the State as correctly interpreting the legislative will.</p>
    <p id="b65-3" data-blocks='[["BL_65.4",65,[177,751,1200,397]]]'>But, as we have already said, when these corporations secured from the State their rights to erect their systems, there was no provision in the Iowa statute to the effect that permission of the municipal authorities should be had.

The limits of the city were thereafter extended, and the city sought to collect for poles that were in the city limits at the time, but when erected were outside the city limits.

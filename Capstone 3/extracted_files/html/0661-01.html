She retained Timothy Coogan to represent her in a claim against the store. On December 21, 1998, just days before the statute of limitations ran, Coogan filed a complaint naming the wrong defendant. He subsequently filed two amended complaints, but the trial court dismissed the case as barred by the statute of limitations.</p>
    <p id="b705-6" data-blocks='[["BL_705.6",705,[116,1258,1254,642]]]'>¶3 Schmidt then filed a complaint against Coogan, asserting claims for negligence and breach of contract. The case went to trial in November 2003, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Schmidt in the amount of $32,000 for past economic damage and $180,000 for noneconomic damages. The trial court granted a new trial on the issue of damages only, finding that Coogan was denied a fair trial. Schmidt’s counsel gave an improper closing argument, and the damages were so excessive as to unmistakably indicate that the verdict was the result of passion and prejudice. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s order granting a new trial on damages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

She alleged that Coogan harassed, in<a id="p664" href="#p664" data-label="664" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*664</a>timidated, and belittled her when she raised the problem of the statute of limitations before it expired.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> During the 2003 trial, the jury was instructed to determine general damages arising out of Coogan’s conduct and malpractice. In the second trial, however, Coogan challenged the availability of general damages in legal malpractice cases. Because her counsel could not find settled authority either affirming or denying the availability of emotional distress damages in Washington, Schmidt sought to add a claim that encompassed the damages. The trial court denied Schmidt’s motion to amend. Schmidt also filed a motion for summary judgment on the availability of general damages and a motion in limine. The court denied both motions.</p>
    <p id="b706-5" data-blocks='[["BL_706.4",706,[192,1094,1251,376]]]'>¶5 After Schmidt rested her case in the damages-only trial, Coogan moved for judgment as a matter of law. He argued that collectibility was an essential element of legal malpractice and that Schmidt presented no evidence that a judgment against Grocery Outlet would have been collectible. The court denied the motion, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Schmidt for $83,733.16 plus interest.</p>
    <p id="b706-6" data-blocks='[["BL_706.5",706,[197,1496,1246,648]]]'>¶6 Coogan appealed the jury verdict, arguing that the trial court should have granted his motion for judgment as a matter of law. Schmidt cross appealed on the ground that general damages are available in attorney malpractice claims and that the trial court erred in denying her motion to amend the complaint. The Court of Appeals concluded that collectibility was an essential component of damages that Schmidt failed to prove, and it reversed the trial court’s denial of Coogan’s motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>Schmidt v.

The presumption is unnecessary and requires a client to always prove the opposite, even when there is no real question regarding solvency. Generally, collectibility is an issue only after the client has established the existence of a fiduciary relationship, the failure of the attorney to exercise due care, the attorney’s negligence resulted in <a id="p667" href="#p667" data-label="667" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*667</a>losing a valid claim (i.e., proving the “case within a case”), and the amount of the lost judgment. The need to establish collectibility is the result of an attorney’s established malpractice at this point in the trial. It is a burden created by the negligent attorney. The presumption that a judgment would have been uncollectible places an unfair burden on the wronged client.</p>
    <p id="b709-4" data-blocks='[["BL_709.4",709,[119,761,1257,857]]]'>¶13 Second, the negligent attorney is in as good a position, if not better, than the client to discover and prove uncollectibility. If the underlying judgment would have been uncollectible, the original attorney should have advised his client of this fact. Failing to do so is negligent and, potentially, a breach of the attorney-client fiduciary relationship. Here, Coogan undertook an investigation of whether the slip-and-fall case was a good faith lawsuit when he represented Schmidt. Coogan testified by deposition (in a statement not placed into evidence before the jury) that an insurance company representative for Tacoma Grocery Outlet confirmed insurance coverage on more than one occasion. This suggests that the attorney is in a better position than the client to establish uncollectibility because the attorney has investigated the underlying claim closer to the time of the accident.</p>

The rules of evidence and the case law generally prohibit introducing evidence of liability insurance in negligence cases. <em>See </em>ER 411; <em>Todd v. Harr, Inc., </em><a href="/wash-2d/69/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="69 Wash. 2d 166" data-case-ids="1057103" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/69/0166-01">69 Wn.2d 166</a>, 168, <a href="/citations/?q=417%20P.2d%20945" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="417 P.2d 945">417 P.2d 945</a> (1966) (“[T]he fact that a personal injury defendant carries liability insurance is entirely immaterial, and the deliberate or wanton injection of this matter into the case by plaintiff is ground for reversal.”); <em>Kappelman v.

The delay may hinder the client’s ability to gather evidence of collectibility. Here, Schmidt fell in 1995 and nearly two decades later this case is still unresolved. In that amount of time, companies may have failed, ownerships may have changed, and other circumstances may have made evidence of collectibility unavailable. It is unfair to place this burden on plaintiffs when the attorney’s negligence created the delay in the first place. <em>See Kituskie, </em><a href="/pa/552/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="552 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="559388" data-case-paths="/pa/552/0275-01">552 Pa. at 283, 285</a>.</p>

The events began almost 20 years ago when Teresa Schmidt slipped and fell at a Tacoma grocery store on December 23,1995. In January 1996, Schmidt retained attorney Coogan to handle her personal injury suit against the store. In 2000, Schmidt filed this attorney malpractice suit against Coogan for his failure to perfect her claim. In 2003, a jury entered a verdict against Coogan for $32,000 in past economic damages and $180,000 for noneconomic damages. Coogan moved for a new trial, remittitur, and reconsideration, claiming Schmidt failed to prove the grocery store had notice of the hazardous condition, a necessary element of the underlying claim. The trial court granted a new trial on the issue of damages only on the basis that Coogan was denied a fair trial.</p>

If collectibility was an issue, it should have been raised during the first jury trial.

The lead opinion erodes the trust that is central to this relationship by erecting artificial barriers to a client’s ability to fully recover damages against a negligent attorney. Insisting that emotional distress damages require a <a id="p686" href="#p686" data-label="686" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*686</a>showing that the attorney’s actions were “particularly egregious,” lead opinion at 674, the lead opinion discounts the special nature of the attorney-client relationship and relies on a faulty analogy between attorney malpractice claims and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) claims involving strangers. It would make more sense to analogize attorney malpractice claims to tort claims in other fiduciary contexts more closely resembling the attorney-client relationship. Because such damages should be allowed, where proved, I respectfully dissent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">7</a>

Lead opinion at 671. This reasoning relies on the refrain that “a negligent act should have some end to its legal consequences.” <em>Hunsley v. Giard, </em><a href="/wash-2d/87/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="87 Wash. 2d 424" data-case-ids="1113794" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/87/0424-01">87 Wn.2d 424</a>, 435, <a href="/citations/?q=553%20P.2d%201096" class="citation" data-index="142" data-cite="553 P.2d 1096">553 P.2d 1096</a> (1976). But, Washington has moved away from the reasoning of <em>Hunsley </em>and allows recovery “when a plaintiff’s emotional distress is ‘within the scope of foreseeable harm . . . , a reasonable reaction given the circumstances, and . . . manifest by objective symptomology.’ ” Lead opinion at 671 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Bylsma v.

The lead opinion provides no additional guidance on how plaintiffs might show this. Yet, the lead opinion holds as a matter of law that Coogan’s actions were not egregious. Lead opinion at 674-75. Coogan failed to file a personal injury lawsuit against the correct defendant before the statute of limitations ran. Schmidt repeatedly inquired about the case, and Coogan ridiculed her for not trusting him. These actions look “remarkably bad” to me.</p>

As the Court of Appeals recognized in <em>Price, </em>emotional distress damages are appropriate when negligence occurs in the context of a relationship preexisting the defendant’s duty, i.e., within a special relationship. <em>Price, </em><a href="/wash-app/114/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="157" data-cite="114 Wash.

    <p id="b730-4" data-blocks='[["BL_730.4",730,[193,1094,1247,904]]]'>¶63 There is a significant difference between the relationship of a tortfeasor and a bystander and between an attorney and a client. While a negligent driver might not foresee that his negligent driving will cause emotional distress to a stranger, an attorney handling a personal injury case can foresee that negligent performance might cause emotional distress to the client. Our NIED rule anticipates the tortfeasor/bystander scenario and applies in the particular situation where a plaintiff “observ[es] an injured relative at the scene of an accident after its occurrence and before there is substantial change in the relative’s condition or location.” <em>Hegel v. McMahon, </em><a href="/wash-2d/136/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="136 Wash. 2d 122" data-case-ids="867939" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/136/0122-01">136 Wn.2d 122</a>, 132, <a href="/citations/?q=960%20P.2d%20424" class="citation" data-index="159" data-cite="960 P.2d 424">960 P.2d 424</a> (1998). I do not see why the lead opinion chose to analogize this situation to the present case, where an attorney, who owes specified fiduciary duties to a client, violates those duties and causes both financial and emotional harm to the client.</p>

Consider, for example, insurance bad faith, which involves a quasi-fiduciary relationship. “An action for bad faith handling of an insurance claim sounds in tort.” <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Butler, </em><a href="/wash-2d/118/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="160" data-cite="118 Wash. 2d 383" data-case-ids="1372124" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/118/0383-01">118 Wn.2d 383</a>, 389, <a href="/citations/?q=823%20P.2d%20499" class="citation" data-index="161" data-cite="823 P.2d 499">823 P.2d 499</a> (1992). “Claims of insurer bad faith ‘are analyzed applying the same principles as any other tort: duty, breach <a id="p689" href="#p689" data-label="689" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*689</a>of that duty, and damages proximately caused hy any breach of duty.’ ” <em>Mut. of Enumclaw Ins.

Emotional distress damages are recognized in this context based on the relationship of trust between the insurer and insured. As the Colorado Supreme Court explained:</p>
    <blockquote id="b731-4" data-blocks='[["BL_731.4",731,[169,820,1200,441]]]'>[I]nsurance contracts are unlike ordinary bilateral contracts. First, the motivation for entering into an insurance contract is different. Insureds enter into insurance contracts for the financial security obtained by protecting themselves from unforeseen calamities and for peace of mind, rather than to secure commercial advantage. Second, there is a disparity of bargaining power between the insurer and the insured; because the insured cannot obtain materially different coverage elsewhere, insurance policies are generally not the result of bargaining.</blockquote>

People turn to attorneys to help them recover after calamities occur. People hire attorneys for the peace of mind that comes from having the assistance of a professional, rather than facing a lawsuit alone. Attorneys inherently have more bargaining power than their clients when entering into a contract for service, if for no other reason than such contracts are legal documents; laypeople hire attorneys primarily because they need assistance to understand the legal consequences of events and documents.</p>

Schmidt suffered significant injuries from an unexpected slip and fall at a grocery store. Lead opinion at 663; Pet’r’s Suppl. Br., App. at 12-34. These injuries interfered with her <a id="p690" href="#p690" data-label="690" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*690</a>relationships and work. Pet’r’s Suppl. Br., App. at 12-34. She sought legal counsel because she needed professional assistance in order to bring her claims. <em>Id. </em>at 40-41. Coogan prepared a contingency fee arrangement without any bargaining with Schmidt. <em>Id. </em>at 39-40. There is no evidence in the record to suggest that Schmidt had a realistic chance of finding a substantially different arrangement with another attorney. <em>See Goodson, </em><a href="/p3d/89/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="169" data-cite="89 P.3d 409" data-case-ids="9258123" data-case-paths="/p3d/89/0409-01">89 P.3d 409</a>. And, Schmidt continued relying on Coogan because she trusted him. Pet’r’s Suppl. Br., App. at 55. Certainly the relationship between attorney and client here was no less one of trust than the insurer/ insured relationship. The lead opinion offers no justification for cutting off the emotional distress damages in this true fiduciary relationship when an insured would be entitled to pursue such damages against a negligent insurer in a quasi-fiduciary relationship.</p>
    <p id="b732-4" data-blocks='[["BL_732.4",732,[198,1211,1250,994]]]'>¶67 In the end, the lead opinion’s rule rests on the wrong analogy, that of NIED claims between strangers. It reflects nothing more than a judicial determination that emotional distress damages are unforeseeable in this context. The proffered rationale for erecting a barrier to recovery is the lead opinion’s conclusion that Schmidt suffered merely a “pecuniary loss” and that the subject matter of her personal injury suit “was not particularly sensitive” because “she did not lose her freedom and Coogan’s actions were not egregious.” Lead opinion at 674. Given that other classes of fiduciaries and quasi-fiduciaries do not receive the special protections that attorneys do under the lead opinion’s rule, I find this unsatisfying. The special relationship between attorneys and their clients should not shield attorneys whose malpractice foreseeably causes emotional distress. Rather, the special relationship should allow for greater recovery because of the greater harm that a negligent attorney may inflict on a trusting client. I respectfully dissent.</p>

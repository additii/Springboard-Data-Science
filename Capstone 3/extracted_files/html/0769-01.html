Moreover, notably missing from the Supreme Court’s analysis in <em>Upjohn </em>is any discussion of the roles that a duty of loyalty or obedience plays with respect to the attorney-client privilege. The privilege itself is not grounded in concepts of a duty on behalf of the client to disclose information to its attorney, just as its extension to <a id="p793" href="#p793" data-label="793" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*793</a>lower-level employees is not based on their duty to provide information to the corporation.</p>

The rationale behind extending the privilege beyond the control group of the corporation is that lower-level employees, by virtue of their agency relationship with the corporation, have the authority to bind the corporation and control its actions in ways that can lead to legal consequences for the corporation. <em>See Upjohn, </em><a href="/us/449/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="449 U.S. 383" data-case-ids="11716190" data-case-paths="/us/449/0383-01">449 U.S. at 391</a>; <em>see also Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n, </em><a href="/us/471/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="471 U.S. 343" data-case-ids="6202584" data-case-paths="/us/471/0343-01">471 U.S. at 348</a> (noting that a corporation is an inanimate entity that can act only through its agents). It is for this reason that corporate counsel should be able to speak frankly with those employees and agents who have knowledge of the events that relate to the subject of the lawyer’s legal services, regardless of those employees’ subsequent personal employment decisions. Extending the privilege to cover communications with former employees who were knowledgeable agents of the corporation with respect to the time period and subjects discussed in the communications ensures that this remains a privilege with the corporation and distinguishes these employees from third-party witnesses.

Because the trial record contained evidence that Willis entered the lane of vehicle travel in the ramp, the courts concluded that his speech occurred in a nonpublic forum and that his constitutional challenge must therefore fail. In other words, the lower appellate courts rewrote the ordinance on review so that it prohibited speech “in” freeway ramps<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> instead of “at” both ramps and intersections.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

This reasoning does not support Willis’ argument, as the lead opinion contends, because highway rest stops are akin to highway off-ramps in that they are not accessible to general pedestrian traffic.

We have recently analyzed two forums not unlike the instant forum, as they involved an analysis of forums involving sidewalks. We found that utility poles on sidewalks and a walkway to a monorail station platform through a shopping center were both nonpublic forums. <em>City of Seattle v. Mighty Movers, Inc., </em><a href="/wash-2d/152/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="152 Wash. 2d 343" data-case-ids="1217438" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/152/0343-01">152 Wn.2d 343</a>, 359-60, <a href="/citations/?q=96%20P.3d%20979" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="96 P.3d 979">96 P.3d 979</a> (2004); <em>Sanders, </em>160 Wn.2d at 219-20. In <em>Mighty Movers, </em>we reasoned that in spite of their location on sidewalks, utility poles do not have the characteristics of a public forum. 152 Wn.2d at 360. Pointing to a United States Supreme Court case that also considered the forum catego<a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>rization of utility poles, we stated that utility poles did not have the “traditional right of access” associated with them “comparable to the right of access to public streets and parks.” <em>Id. </em>at 355 (quoting <em>Vincent, </em><a href="/us/466/0789-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="466 U.S. 789" data-case-ids="6206324" data-case-paths="/us/466/0789-01">466 U.S. at 814</a>). In <em>Sanders, </em>we held that a public easement providing pedestrian access to a monorail platform was a nonpublic forum. 160 Wn.2d at 220. We reasoned that it was not like a sidewalk because the easement had “not historically served as a public thoroughfare.” <em>Id. </em>at 219. Importantly, <em>Sanders </em>looked at whether a principal use of the property was the “free exchange of ideas.” <em>Id. </em>at 213-15. We found that the purpose and function of the walkway was to provide pedestrian access to the monorail platform, not for the free exchange of ideas. <em>Id. </em>at 215.</p>
    <p id="b271-4" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[201,1130,1253,1065]]]'>¶36 We should follow our own precedent regarding the nature of the forum here. The freeway ramp here is similar to the utility pole in <em>Mighty Movers </em>and the walkway to the monorail station in <em>Sanders. </em>Both could be said to be akin to sidewalks, and yet we found both to be nonpublic forums. Like the utility pole in <em>Mighty Movers </em>that did not have a traditional use rooted in expression, freeway ramps likewise are not rooted in a traditional use of free expression because they are unsafe for pedestrians due to the high speed at which cars travel. Like in <em>Sanders, </em>where we said a walkway was a nonpublic forum because it was not historically a thoroughfare, freeway ramps certainly do not historically allow pedestrian access. In employing the “principal purpose” analysis, we must consider the purpose of a freeway ramp and intersection. The principal purpose of the freeway ramps is to transport vehicles on and off of the state highway transportation system. I cannot find that a principal purpose of a freeway ramp is the free exchange of ideas because, rather, it is the free exchange of vehicle traffic.</p>

As the lead opinion noted, a restriction on speech in a nonpublic forum need only be <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose of the forum. <em>See Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va., </em><a href="/us/515/0819-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="515 U.S. 819" data-case-ids="1564137" data-case-paths="/us/515/0819-01">515 U.S. 819</a>, 829, <a href="/us/515/0819-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="515 U.S. 819" data-case-ids="1564137" data-case-paths="/us/515/0819-01">115 S.

I would hold that LMC 9A.04.020A meets both requirements because the ordinance takes no position on begging as expressing a viewpoint and because it is reasonable for the city to restrict pedestrians from standing on a freeway ramp in order to maintain safety. Since cities may reasonably regulate speech in nonpublic forums and have done so here, I would affirm the courts below in finding that the ordinance was constitutionally applied to Willis. I respectfully dissent.</p>

    <p id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[202,1135,1247,422]]]'>¶38 The lead opinion holds that the ordinance is over-broad because it regulates areas that are traditional public forums. The record is clear that Willis was standing in the traffic lane of a freeway off-ramp when he was cited under this ordinance. I would hold that the particular location at issue is a nonpublic forum since it is decidedly unsafe for pedestrians. Thus, as applied to Willis, the ordinance permissibly regulates speech. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>

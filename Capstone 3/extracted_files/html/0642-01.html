She e-mailed Kenneth A. Schütz, looking for such a position. Schütz is the founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of FixtureOne Corporation, which sells fixtures, casework, and displays for use in retail stores. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 62. Both FixtureOne and Schütz are based in Pennsylvania, and at the time of Failla’s e-mail, FixtureOne had no physical presence or customers in Washington.</p>
    <p id="b688-10" data-blocks='[["BL_688.14",688,[194,1862,1247,524]]]'>|3 Failla’s inquiry caught the interest of Schütz, who replied to Failla that she “may be a fit” for FixtureOne because the company did “not have a sales representative in [this] area of the country.” CP at 93. The parties continued negotiating, and Schütz eventually invited Failla to interview with FixtureOne in Pennsylvania, knowing she lived and planned to work in Washington. Schütz admits the nature of FixtureOne’s business allows sales representatives to work anywhere with Internet and telephone access. CP at 63.</p>

      <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>¶4 FixtureOne hired Failla as an account executive in November 2009 and agreed to pay her an annual salary of $75,000, plus an additional three percent commission on sales. Failla’s job responsibilities included, among other duties, “leading the company” in “[planning, execution and management of profitable growth and expansion of the company’s revenue base and market share.” CP at 30. The job also involved the “[d]esign, implementation and management of business development, client acquisition, and sales strategies.” <em>Id. </em>Failla reported directly to Schütz, and the two communicated extensively by e-mail.</p>
    <p id="b689-4" data-blocks='[["BL_689.4",689,[115,984,1249,648]]]'>¶5 In December 2010, Failla requested a promotion and a raise. Schütz agreed and promoted her to FixtureOne’s vice president of sales, increasing her salary to $135,000. Although there were outstanding commissions owed, Failla accepted the promotion and salary increase based on the assurances that the commissions would be paid. CP at 36. Schütz provided a draft employment agreement for Failla to sign in connection with the promotion. Among other things, the agreement contained a provision that it would be interpreted in accordance with Pennsylvania law. Failla proposed revisions to the agreement, but for reasons unknown neither Failla nor Schütz ever signed it.</p>

She received regular paychecks, and the only issue in this case is the sales commissions owed to her that were not paid. On May 26, 2011, Schütz e-mailed Failla to tell her that FixtureOne was “clos[ing] its doors” and ending her employment the following day. CP at 44. He assured Failla that FixtureOne would “pay your commissions and expenses asap in the next several weeks.” <em>Id. </em>For two months following her termination, Schütz returned Failla’s requests for payment with various explanations as to why the commissions remained unpaid. At one point he told Failla that he signed her commission check and blamed another employee for not mailing it. At other times he faulted the company’s comp<a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>troller for failing to calculate the commission amount. Schütz eventually advised Failla that she would not receive a commission check and for the first time disputed whether such commissions were even owed. CP at 50.</p>

Failla served Schütz in Pennsylvania but was unable to serve FixtureOne. Consequently, the suit proceeded against Schütz alone.</p>

The trial court concluded it had personal jurisdiction and denied Schutz’s summary judgment motion. Instead, the court granted summary judgment to Failla, awarding double damages pursuant to RCW 49.52.070, which provides for such damages when an employer willfully withholds wages due an employee.</p>

The United States Supreme Court recently pointed out two key aspects of this relationship in a personal jurisdiction case: first, whether the relationship arose “out of contacts that the ‘defendant <em>himself </em>create [d] with the forum State,” and second, whether the defendant had contacts with the forum state itself, not lust contacts with persons who reside there. <em>Id. </em>at 1122.</p>

The plaintiff was the one who initiated the relationship by contacting the defendant in Pennsylvania, seeking employment. She then flew to Pennsylvania to interview for the position. The plaintiff then conducted all of her work via phone, e-mail, and occasional travel. She did not solicit any business in Washington, and there is no record that the business made any sales or did any adver<a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>tising in Washington. Even the payroll checks signed by the employer were signed in Pennsylvania. In sum, the defendant did not initiate any contact with Washington nor did he conduct any business in Washington.

    <p id="b701-4" data-blocks='[["BL_701.4",701,[116,716,1249,803]]]'>¶35 The United States Supreme Court has “consistently rejected attempts to satisfy the defendant-focused ‘minimum contacts’ inquiry by demonstrating contacts between the <em>plaintiff </em>(or third parties) and the forum State.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In fact, no matter how “significant the plaintiff’s contacts with the forum may be,” they cannot be decisive when determining whether the defendant had minimum contacts. <em>Id. </em>As described above, the employer’s only contacts with Washington were his contacts with the plaintiff. He took no actions related to this state. The majority’s inquiry is focused on the defendant’s contact with the plaintiff, but none of those contacts related to Washington. Since the plaintiff has not demonstrated minimum contacts between the defendant and the state, there is not a sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction.</p>

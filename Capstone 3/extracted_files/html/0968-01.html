Section 1 thereof reads as follows: ‘ ‘ That it shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation or individual in the city of Helena, Arkansas, to engage in, follow, or carry on any of the following businesses, trades or occupations, vocations, callings or professions without first having obtained and paid an annual license therefor from t'he city collector; the amounts of such license are hereby fixed in this ordinance.” Item 56 of the ordinance imposed a tax of $50 on all persons practicing the profession of dentistry, and item 58 imposed a tax of $50 on doctors and surgeons. The ordinance required the tax to be paid in advance on or before October 15 of each year, and by section 30 it was provided that: “Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this ordinance shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined twice the amount of the license imposed by this ordinance; each day that such violation shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.”</p>

An appeal was duly prosecuted to the circuit court, and, pending the appeal, the ordinance was amended on September 7, 1933, by ordinance No. 2118, which reduced the amount of the license to be paid by physicians, surgeons and dentists for the next year by one-half. The amendatory ordinance contained no saving clause, but in the last section thereof it was provided that “This ordinance to take full force and effect from and after its passage, and all ordinances in conflict therewith to be void. ’ ’</p>

This motion was sustained, and the cases were dismissed, and this appeal has been prosecuted from that order.</p>

    <p id="b988-6" data-blocks='[["BL_988.4",988,[300,722,1202,303]]]'>It is argued that ordinance No. 2118 is an “alteration” of ordinance No. 1858, within the meaning of § 7500, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, and operates to repeal it, inasmuch as there was no clause in the later ordinance saving prosecutions pending in the earlier ordinance. See <em>Wichita </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em><a href="/kan/78/0859-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="78 Kan. 859" data-case-ids="1103993" data-case-paths="/kan/78/0859-01">78 Kan. 859</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20L.R.A.N.S.%20245" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="23 L.R.A.N.S. 245">23 L.

    <p id="b988-7" data-blocks='[["BL_988.5",988,[296,1031,1208,558]]]'>We are of the opinion, however, that this argument is based upon a misconception of the purpose and effect of ordinance No. 2118. No purpose is apparent in the amendatory ordinance to remit the tax for the fiscal year 1932-1933, nor to reduce the amount thereof. On the contrary, the purpose and effect of the amendatory ordinance is merely to reduce the tax for the ensuing fiscal year of 1933-1934, leaving unchanged the tax for the preceding year. The tax for the year 1932-1933 was due and was alleged to be delinquent when the amendatory ordinance was passed.</p>

W. 179</a>, it was held that, where there is no express repeal by the last enactment of prior statutes, it is to be presumed that no repeal was intended, and such effect will not be given unless the statutes are in irreconcilable conflict. <em>Babb </em>v. <em>El Dorado, </em><a href="/ark/170/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="170 Ark. 10" data-case-ids="1371677" data-case-paths="/ark/170/0010-01">170 Ark. 10</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=278%20S.W.%20649" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="278 S.W. 649">278 S.

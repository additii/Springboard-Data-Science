The trial before the chancery court resulted in a decree dismissing appellant’s complaint for want of equity.</p>

Appellant took possession under the contract and occupied the house, and paid sixteen of the notes as they fell due. The sale included <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>also the furniture in the house at the stipulated prise of $2,000, making a total of $11,500 for the house and furniture.

Appellee denied this allegation in her answer as well as in her testimony. Appellant exhibited with her complaint what purports to be a written contract, for the resale of the property to appellant, but the instrument does not purport to have been signed by appellee. Appellant testified that the terms of the contract were orally agreed upon between her qnd appellee on the day she reconvéyed the property to appellee, and that the contract was prepared on that day, but that appellee postponed signing it, and finally refused altogether to sign it, claiming that she desired to make changes in the contract.</p>

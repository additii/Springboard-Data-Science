Appellants insist that the court erred in directing the verdict against them; but it has frequently been held that, under such circumstances of submission, the court has the right to direct a verdict, the parties having by such request waived the right to a verdict by the jury, and the decision of the court has the same effect as would have been given to the verdict of a jury, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to appellee. <em>St. L.

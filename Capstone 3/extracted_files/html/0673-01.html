Petitioner Nakia Lee Otton seeks reversal of his convictions for second degree assault and felony harassment. The victim testified at Otton’s trial, and because her testimony was inconsistent with her prior sworn statement to police about the incident, the trial court admitted the victim’s prior statement as substantive evidence. Otton acknowledges that the trial court’s decision and the Court of Appeals opinion affirming that decision were proper in accordance with this court’s long-standing precedent. He asks us to reject that precedent. We decline the invitation and affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>

Otton’s proposed interpretation also reads into the phrase “other proceeding” terms that are not there.

It is not clear how the physical location where a statement is given would necessarily advance the plain language or underlying purposes of the rule, and a grand jury proceeding is clearly an “other proceeding,” even <a id="p684" href="#p684" data-label="684" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*684</a>though it is “investigatory,” rather than adversarial, in nature. <em>Castro-Ayon, </em><a href="/f2d/537/1055-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="537 F.2d 1055" data-case-ids="1050059" data-case-paths="/f2d/537/1055-01">537 F.2d at 1058</a>.</p>

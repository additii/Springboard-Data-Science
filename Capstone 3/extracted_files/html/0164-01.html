The authorities on this subject are reviewed in the case of <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Trulock, </em><a href="/ark/109/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="109 Ark. 556" data-case-ids="1341154" data-case-paths="/ark/109/0556-01">109 Ark. 556</a>. We decided, however, in that case that the rule was not an inflexible -one, and was not applicable where there were other. controlling and unmistakable <em>indicia </em>found in the statute of a contrary intention on the part of the lawmakers. In the opinion in that case it was said: “But that rule of interpretation is not an absolute or an inflexible one, and is not always arbitrarily applied. It must be considered with other rules equally well settled, and must yield place to others which may, under the language of a statute, be more appropriately and accurately employed. The cardinal rule of interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning of the lawmakers as expressed in the language which they have used. Not what the lawmakers themselves meant, but what the .language they used means; And all rules of interpretation must yield to this as the paramount one.” Again, it was said in the same opinion: “The words, ‘be amended to read as follows,’ constituted a mere formula, in which there is <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>no magic, except that it ordinarily carries the meaning, when not otherwise limited, that the amendatory statute excludes all omitted provisions of the former law.” The conclusion reached in that case was that, notwithstanding the use of this formula in -the new statute, it did not exclude by repeal the omitted provisions in the former law.</p>

The use of the letter in the same way that the preceding letters of the alphabet were used in the original statute in designating the different rates of taxation on the several ■ products is undoubtedly of emphatic significance in determining what the real intention of the lawmakers was, but we cannot agree with counsel that this is the only evidence of a contrary intention afforded by the statute itself and the original statute, which had been enacted only a short time before, at the same session of the Legislature. The whole structure and form of the amendatory statute is so identical with the different subdivisions of the original § 5 as to give compelling force to the idea that the addition of another subdivision was intended rather than a substitution for the whole of the original section. The natural and ordinary effect upon the mind ill comparing the new statute with the original section is that an addition to the section was intended, rather than a substitute. It deals solely with taxation of the production of a com<a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>modity, manganese, which is of little consequence in this State, compared with the production of the great commodities coal, lumber, and bauxite, mentioned in the original section, and it is scarcely conceivable that the lawmakers intended, in dealing with this commodity, to overturn the carefully laid taxation -scheme prescribed in the recently enacted and yet untried general statute on this subject.</p>

The statute was a new one, and when the amendatory statute was passed the former one had not gone into effect, and was wholly untried. There had been no experience in the enforcement of the original statute so as to give rise to the belief that material changes had taken place in the legislative mind. It is true that the repeal of the whole of original § 5 would have left a complete scheme for the uniform taxation of the privilege of production of all commodities mentioned at .the rate of two and one half per cent, on valuation, but this is of little force in inducing the conclusion that the lawmakers had undergone a complete change of mind in the scheme of imposing a specific amount upon most of the great commodities to be produced.</p>

In each of the cases last cited, if the amendatory acts had been literally construed, the effect would have been to practically destroy the entire law upon the subject sought to be covered by legislation. The court reasoned in these cases that the Legislature certainly did not intend to destroy the law it was attempting to enact, and therefore read the original and amendatory acts in each.case together, to ascertain the intent of the Legislature from all the language used in both acts. In the instant ease it is unnecessary to read the statutes together to ascertain the intent of the Legislature in each act. Section 5 of the original act may be treated as repealed by act No. 681, according to the formula used, and a privilege tax will remain, of two and one-half per cent, of the gross cash market value of every natural resource, including bauxite, coal' and lumber, except, of course, manganese, which is specially taxed under the last act. See § 4, act No. 118. In other words, if act No. 681 be treated as a substitute for § 5 of act No. 118, as it should be under the general rule of construction, if possible, no natural resources severed from the soil will escape the privilege tax. The entire subject . attempted to be legislated upon would still be covered by statute, so the whole law would not be abrogated by a literal construction of the amendatory act. The instant case therefore comes clearly within the general rule, and <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>not within the exception announced in the Trulock and McCartney cases, <em>supra. </em>In arriving at the intent of the Legislature the letter (d) should not be permitted to override the plain, unambiguous language of the amendatory act. On the other hand, the well-established meaning of the formula, “amended so as to read as follows,” should override the uncertain and indefinite meaning of the letter (d). This can be accomplished by treating the latter (d), which is meaningless as used in the act, as surplusage.</p>

It may have been, and -probably was, the intent of the Legislature to substitute the special tax' on manganese for the special tax on the other three commodities. It is apparent that said § 5, as it stood before the amendatory act 681 was passed, contained inequalities and discriminations between the three commodities of bauxite, coal, and lumber. One cent on coal was so nominal that it amounted to no tax at all. Seven and one-half cents on lumber was almost as nominal as that of coal, whereas the tax of twenty-five cents on bauxite was largely out of proportion to the taxes on the other two commodities. In speculating on the intent, one might just as well say that the Legislature intended to wipe -out these inequalities between three of the most important natural resources, as to say that it intended to add another commodity to the three for special taxation. By indulging the former speculation as to intent, the tax for severing the three most important natural resources would be equalized The fact that we are led into a field of speculation, by treating the statutes <em>m pari materia </em>in search for the intent, should prevent the invocation of that rule of construction.

In each of the six incidents from which Chenoweth’s convictions for a pair of charges for rape and incest arose, a single act of sexual intercourse served as the basis for the corresponding incest and rape convictions. Because only a single act occurred, the corresponding incest and rape crimes necessarily occurred <em>simultaneously </em>and each crime was based on the same (unbroken, continuous, and unchanging) conduct.

For each of the six criminal episodes, Chenoweth had a single criminal purpose: sexual intercourse with his daughter. Accordingly, consistent with <em>Till, Walden, </em>and <em>Grantham, </em>I would hold that each pair of charges for first degree incest and third degree child rape shared the same criminal intent, victim, time, and place, thereby constituting the same criminal conduct. <em>See </em>RCW 9.94A.589(1)(a) (“current offenses [that] encompass the same criminal conduct. . . shall be counted as one crime”); <em>see also </em>RCW 9.94A.525(5)(a)(i) (“Prior offenses which were found, under RCW 9.94A.589(1)(a), to encompass the same criminal conduct, shall be counted as one offense, <em>the offense that yields the highest offender score.” </em>(emphasis added)).

But <em>Calle </em>simply does not say that. <em>Calle </em>says that <em>for purposes of assessing double jeopardy, </em>aside from considering the “same evidence” test and the “same elements” test, Washington courts look to other “indicia of legislative intent ... to determine whether a defendant is receiving <em>multiple punishment for the same offense.” </em>125 Wn.2d at 778 (emphasis added).

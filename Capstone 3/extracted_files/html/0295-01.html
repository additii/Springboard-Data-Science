Johnson<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> was convicted of five crimes related to several days of ongoing domestic violence against his wife. We review two holdings by the Court of Appeals. First, the Court of Appeals overturned Johnson’s unlawful imprisonment conviction because the State did not include the definition of “restrain” in the information charging him with the crime. We reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate Johnson’s conviction because charging documents need contain only the essential elements of a crime, not related definitions. Second, the Court of Appeals agreed with Johnson that it was error to give a jury instruction on the generic definition of “reckless” for the charge of assault in the second degree but held that his counsel was not ineffective for proposing it because no court had yet ruled on the issue. On this issue we affirm the Court of Appeals, but for a different reason. It is not error to instruct the jury on the generic definition of “reckless” as long as the jury is also given a “to convict” instruction that lists every element of the crime the State needs to prove in order to convict the defendant, including the charge-specific language for “reckless.”</p>

The “to convict” instructions are the primary “yardstick” the jury uses to measure culpability, and here they were accurate.

RCW 9A.36.021(1)(a). Another instruction in this case then defined the mental state of “recklessly”: “A person is reckless or acts recklessly when he or she knows of and disregards a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur ....” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 42. The defendant argues that the lack of charge-specific language in this definitional jury instruction permitted the jury to convict him if he was reckless as to <em>any </em>wrongful act occurring, whereas our case law requires that he may be convicted only if he was reckless as to the specific wrongful act charged — i.e., inflicting substantial bodily harm.</p>

The fact that the “to convict” instruction properly stated the elements of second degree assault does not cure the overbroad definition of “reckless.” This becomes evident when one plugs the general definition of “reckless” into the “to convict” instruction: “To convict the defendant. . ., each of the following elements ... must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt: . . . That the defendant thereby [knowing of and disregarding a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur] inflicted substantial bodily harm.” CP at 49. Thus, including the phrase “recklessly inflicted substantial bodily harm” in the “to convict” instruction does nothing to prevent the jury from convicting if it finds, for example, that the defendant was reckless as to inflicting minor bodily harm, but in fact inflicted substantial bodily harm. That relieves the State of its burden to prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt. And it is precisely the inclusion of the general definition of “reckless” elsewhere in the instructions that permits such a conviction based on a lesser burden of proof for the State.</p>

First, the majority asserts that if it decided this case differently, a general definition of “reckless” could never be used in jury instructions. But the general defini<a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>tion instruction quoted above <em>should never </em>be used in jury instructions, because it does in fact lower the State’s burden of proof. A modified instruction, referring to something other than disregarding the risk of <em>“a </em>wrongful act,” might cure the problem, though. For example, the definition could reference <em>“the </em>wrongful result charged” in the “to convict” instruction. <em>See State v. Cronin, </em><a href="/wash-2d/142/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="142 Wash. 2d 568" data-case-ids="1361345" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/142/0568-01">142 Wn.2d 568</a>, 579, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20P.3d%20752" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="14 P.3d 752">14 P.3d 752</a> (2000) (accomplice liability instruction must reference intent to further “ ‘ “the crime” ’ ” charged, not just “ ‘ “a crime” ’ ” (quoting <em>State v.

On the contrary, multiple charge-specific definitions would provide specificity. Or, a single instruction referencing <em>“the </em>wrongful act charged” might do the trick. Either solution would reduce the potential for jury confusion as to which act the recklessness mens rea applied. Otherwise, in the multiple-recklessness-crimes scenario, a jury might find, for example, that recklessness as to one of the charged acts sufficed to establish recklessness for all the charged acts, and such a finding would in fact be supported by a literal reading of the definition in the jury instructions.</p>

In this case, we address whether a particular type of report about a juvenile offender- — a special sex offender disposition alternative (SSODA) evaluation, RCW 13.40.162 — should be filed in the official juvenile court file and therefore be open to the public. The legislature has explicitly defined the contents of the official juvenile court file as “the petition or information, motions, memorandums, briefs, findings of the court, and court orders.” RCW 13.50.010(l)(b). Since the SSODA evaluation does not fit within any of these categories, it is not a part of the official juvenile court file.

    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[197,577,1253,950]]]'>¶11 The parties frame the issue as whether the SSODA evaluation belongs in the official juvenile court file or the social file, but our review of the statutory scheme leads us to conclude that the determinative question is whether the SSODA evaluation belongs in the official juvenile court file or not. Our conclusion is based on the phrasing of the confidentiality provision related to juvenile records: <em>“[a]ll records other than the official juvenile court file are confidential” </em>and may be released only pursuant to a few specific statutory provisions. RCW 13.50.050(3) (emphasis added). The legislature’s phrasing indicates that all juvenile records are by default confidential unless they are part of the official juvenile court file or a particular statutory exemption applies. Thus, the question before this court is slightly more limited: Are SSODA evaluations part of the official juvenile court file? If not, they must be kept confidential, regardless of which other category they might fall under.</p>
    <p id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.6",314,[200,1559,1250,583]]]'>¶12 Thus, the key issue in this case is the definition of the “official juvenile court file.” The contents of the file are explicitly defined by statute through the following exclusive list: “the petition or information, motions, memorandums, briefs, findings of the court, and court orders.” RCW 13.50.010(l)(b). On its face, the SSODA evaluation does not belong in the court file because it is not a petition or information, motion, memorandum, brief, finding of the court, or court order. Put simply, it is not a court document. Rather, it is a psychological report that includes a treatment plan.</p>
    <p id="b314-6" data-blocks='[["BL_314.7",314,[201,2166,1253,205]],["BL_315.1",315,[112,343,1251,652]]]'>¶13 The State focuses intently on the definition of another category of juvenile records — the “social file” (which contains “the records and reports of the probation counselor.” RCW 13.50.010(l)(d)). The State argues that if a <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>document does not fit into the social file, it should automatically be considered part of the official juvenile court file. But this interpretation is directly contrary to the phrasing of the confidentiality provision, which specifically carves out the official juvenile court file as the only file open to the public and indicates that <em>all other records </em>are confidential. Based on this phrasing, the most reasonable interpretation is that documents that do not fall within the definition of the “official juvenile court file” should be kept confidential. Accordingly, since the SSODA evaluation does not fall within the definition of the “official juvenile court file,” we hold that it should be kept confidential.</p>
    <p id="b315-4" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[108,1019,1256,1121]]]'>¶14 This holding is consistent with the expressed legislative intent to protect the confidentiality of all juvenile records, with certain enumerated exceptions. RCW 13.50-.050(2), (3). This court has already recognized that the “SSODA evaluation may contain sensitive, privileged, or embarrassing information, including details regarding a juvenile’s social situation or alleged deviant behaviors.” <em>State v. Sanchez, </em><a href="/wash-2d/177/0835-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="177 Wash. 2d 835" data-case-ids="4131297" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/177/0835-01">177 Wn.2d 835</a>, 846, <a href="/citations/?q=306%20P.3d%20935" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="306 P.3d 935">306 P.3d 935</a> (2013). Holding that the SSODA evaluation belongs in the official juvenile court file means that it is open to the public. RCW 13.50.050(2). We have recognized that “indiscriminately releasing such an evaluation to the public, or to an agency without need or authority to review it, could raise legitimate privacy concerns.” <em>Sanchez, </em>177 Wn.2d at 846. Because the SSODA evaluation also contains multiple descriptions of the offenses, RCW 13.40.162(2)(a)(i), it could also contain extremely sensitive information regarding the victims. Making the SSODA evaluation automatically open to the public is contrary to the legislative intent expressed in RCW 13.50.050(3), which provides that <em>all </em>records other than the court file are confidential.</p>

Loukaitis, </em><a href="/wash-app/82/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="82 Wash. App. 460" data-case-ids="1043782" data-case-paths="/wash-app/82/0460-01">82 Wn.

Specifically, the State points to a statement in <em>Loukaitis </em>where the Court of Appeals indicated that expert <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>testimony from a defendant’s own mental health expert is not part of the social file. <em>Id. </em>at 467. However, <em>Loukaitis </em>is inapposite because the defendant in that case was trying to stretch RCW 13.50.050’s protection of the records in the social file to close a juvenile court declination hearing where his psychiatrist was about to testify regarding her diagnosis and medical opinion of the defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 463. The court held that <em>testimony </em>from the juvenile offender’s own expert witness is not part of the social file. <em>Id. </em>at 467. That holding is not on point in this case, where we are specifically applying RCW 13.50.050 to <em>records.</em>

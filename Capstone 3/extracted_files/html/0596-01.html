Wake-field is homeless, disabled, and indigent. Her only income is $710 in social security disability payments each month, and as a result, she struggles to meet her own basic needs. Wakefield and amici ask this court to reverse the district court’s order and hold that the current practice of strict LFO enforcement against homeless, disabled, and indigent people in Benton County violates state and federal statutes. Because the district court’s order was contrary to both the <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>law and the evidence in the record, we reverse. Under state law, LFOs should be imposed only if an individual has a present or future ability to pay, and LFOs may be remitted when paying them would impose a manifest hardship on the person. In this case, Wakefield has no present or future ability to pay LFOs. She already struggles to obtain basic needs such as secure housing, food, and medical care. Both parties agree that ordering Wakefield to pay would impose a manifest hardship on her and that her LFOs should be remitted. However, both parties also request that we issue an opinion on the merits to provide guidance to parties in the future. Pursuant to our analysis below, we order that her LFOs be remitted.</p>

She entered the foster care system at the age of 14. At the age of 18, she began receiving social security income because she is unable to work due to her permanent disabilities, which include bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Her monthly social security disability payment has been her only income, although she also receives about $170 in food stamps assistance from the State. At this time, she is 27 years old.</p>

She is also attempting to find stable housing.</p>

She is not challenging fines or nondiscretion-ary LFOs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Wakefield acknowledges that she did not appeal the costs imposed as part of her judgment and sentence, and thus she is not challenging the original decision imposing those costs.</p>
    <p id="b639-4" data-blocks='[["BL_639.4",639,[201,728,1248,629]]]'>¶5 The parties agree that Wakefield has not been making monthly payments on these outstanding costs (although she has intermittently made a couple of small payments over the years), and the district court scheduled a fine review hearing, which is essentially a contempt proceeding. Wakefield moved to remit the costs pursuant to RCW 10.01.160(4) because she did not have the ability to pay, and because being forced to pay would create a manifest hardship for her and her family. The cities were not contacted about the fine review hearing and did not appear. The only attendees were Wakefield, her attorney, and her expert witness.</p>
    <p id="b639-5" data-blocks='[["BL_639.5",639,[202,1388,1246,417]]]'>¶6 At the fine review hearing, Wakefield testified with regard to her current situation. She explained that she is homeless and that she does not have enough money to pay her LFOs, despite minimizing her expenses as much as possible. She recounted her expenses for the past few months and explained how she spends her monthly $710 on her basic needs (or at least attempting to meet her basic needs).</p>

Dr. Pierce testified regarding her research calculating “self-sufficiency standards,” which are measurements of “the minimum amount of money you need to adequately meet your basic needs.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 78. These standards include the re<a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>sources needed to meet only “the core necessities of life, such as clothing, food, shelter and medical care at a decent level.” <em>Id. </em>at 188. Dr. Pierce explained, “To be below this minimum means the inability to secure even the basic necessities with one’s own resources, and be forced to sacrifice one need for another, e.g., not eat in order to pay for heat, or be forced to rely on luck, on the uncertainty of the kindness of others.” <em>Id. </em>It does not include “recreation, entertainment, savings, debt repayment, or any other needs beyond the inescapable daily needs of basic human existence.” <em>Id. </em>at 189. Dr. Pierce testified that the self-sufficiency standard in 2011 for a one person household in Kennewick or Richland is $1,492 per month. Dr. Pierce testified that Wakefield’s monthly income falls well below that self-sufficiency standard and that “she can’t even meet her basic needs at a bare bones level.” <em>Id. </em>at 85. Based on her experience and the facts of this case, Dr. Pierce stated that ordering Wakefield to pay court costs would be ordering Wakefield to “put her basic survival needs aside.” <em>Id. </em>at 192.</p>

She summarized her understanding of the law in her ruling, stating that “the caselaw doesn’t say just because she’s indigent or just because she has trouble meeting basic needs that she’s excused from the penalty.” <em>Id. </em>at 107. The judge then ordered Wakefield to participate in work crew and to pay $15 each month. At no point did the court make an explicit finding that Wakefield was able to make the payments. Nor did the court mention or apply the manifest hardship standard for remitting costs for indigent defendants.</p>
    <p id="b640-5" data-blocks='[["BL_640.5",640,[202,2084,1246,264]]]'>¶9 Wakefield appealed to Benton County Superior Court.

Such information is crucial to determine whether paying LFOs would create a “manifest hardship” for Wakefield. While the term “manifest hardship” is undefined in the statute, it is difficult to see how being unable to provide for one’s own basic needs—food, shelter, basic medical expenses—would not meet that standard. A person’s present inability to meet his or her own basic needs is not only relevant, but crucial to determining whether paying LFOs would create a manifest hardship.</p>

Blazina, </em><a href="/wash-2d/182/0827-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="182 Wash. 2d 827" data-case-ids="4075837" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/182/0827-01">182 Wn.2d 827</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=344%20P.3d%20680" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="344 P.3d 680">344 P.3d 680</a> (2015): courts can and should use GR 34 as a guide for determining whether someone has an ability to pay costs. GR 34 is a court rule designed to simplify the process for determining whether a person is indigent for purposes of court and clerk’s fees and <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>charges in civil cases. Under GR 34, “courts must find a person indigent if the person establishes that he or she receives assistance from a needs-based, means-tested assistance program, such as Social Security or food stamps.” <em>Id. </em>at 838. Similarly, “courts must find a person indigent if his or her household income falls below 125 percent of the federal poverty guideline.” <em>Id. </em>at 838-39. As we have previously held, and as we again hold today: “[I]f someone does meet the GR 34 standard for indigency, courts should seriously question that person’s ability to pay LFOs.” <em>Id. </em>at 839. This is true for both the imposition and enforcement of LFOs. The district court should not have disregarded Wakefield’s eligibility for needs-based, means-tested assistance when evaluating her ability to pay LFOs. Instead, courts should regard such eligibility as strong evidence of indigency.</p>
    <p id="b645-4" data-blocks='[["BL_645.4",645,[201,1240,1248,855]]]'>¶25 Finally, we must reiterate the particularly punitive consequences of LFOs for indigent individuals that this court discussed in <em>Blazina: </em>“[O]n average, a person who pays $25 per month toward their LFOs will owe the State more 10 years after conviction than they did when the LFOs were initially assessed.” <em>Id. </em>at 836. Given this reality, trial courts should be cautious of imposing such low payment amounts in the long term for impoverished people. For individuals like Wakefield, who show no prospects of any change in their ability to pay, it is unjustly punitive to impose payments that will only cause their LFO amount to increase. Therefore, such low payments should be generally ordered only for short-term situations. If a person has no present or future ability to pay amounts that will actually pay off their LFOs, remission in accordance with RCW 10.01.160(4) is a more appropriate and just option.</p>

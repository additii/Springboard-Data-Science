The proceeds derived and to be derived were and are from policies of insurance procured and carried by Abraham Lazarus for the benefit of his wife, Eosa L. Lazarus. She was the beneficiary named in said' policies at the time of his death. The suit was based upon § 557:9 of Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, which is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b288-5" data-blocks='[["BL_288.6",288,[283,1122,1193,959]]]'>“It shall be lawful for any married woman, by herself and in her name, or in the name of any third person, with his assent, as her trustee, to cause to be insured, for her sole use, the life of her husband, for any definite period, or for the term of his natural life; and, in case of her surviving her husband, the sum or net amount of the insurance becoming due and payable by the terms of the insurance shall be payable to her and for her use; and, in case of the death of the wife before the decease of her husband, the amount of said insurance may be made payable to his or her children, for their use, and to their guardian, for them, if they shall be under age, as shall be provided in the policy of insurance; and such sum or amount of insurance so payable shall be free from the claims of the representatives of the husband, or of any of his creditors; but such exemption shall not apply where the amount of premium annually paid out of the funds or property of the husband shall exceed the sum of three hundred dollars.”</blockquote>

It was ruled in that case that the creditors of the deceased husband might subject any excess insurance carried for the benefit of his wife to the payment of their debts, provided it was alleged and proved that he made a gift out of his funds in order to' cheat, 'hinder and delay his creditors.</p>

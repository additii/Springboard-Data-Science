Several other officers had filed complaints about Henne’s behavior, resulting in internal investigations of Henne. Henne’s lawsuit alleged that those other officers’ complaints lodged against him formed a pattern of harassment and retaliation that amounted to a hostile workplace. He sued Yakima for negligent hiring, training, and supervision of its employees, which, he asserted, perpetuated a hostile work environment and entitled him to damages.</p>

Yakima’s motion asserted that because Henne’s claims were based on coworker complaints and the city’s resulting internal investigations, the new, broader anti-SLAPP statute applied to those claims. In other words, Yakima claimed the protection of the anti-SLAPP suit law because it received controversial communications from others; Yakima made no communications of its own.</p>

At the Court of Appeals, Henne argued that Yakima was not a “person” as defined in the 2010 anti-SLAPP statute, RCW 4.24.525, and therefore could not bring an anti-SLAPP motion in the first place. Yakima contended that governmental entities are among those who may claim the statute’s protection. The Court of Appeals held that Yakima was a “person” within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP law and could therefore file an anti-SLAPP motion, but it also held that Henne’s amendment to his complaint rendered Yakima’s appeal moot due to the “removal of the allegations relating to the City’s internal investigations of Officer Henne.” <em>Henne v.

Yakima argues that it is a municipal corporation, or at the very least a legal entity, and therefore government entities will always fit the plain language definition of “person” under the statute. Yakima’s statutory interpretation argument does not consider the portion of that newer anti-SLAPP statute that explicitly distinguishes between the governmental entity and a “moving party” who can bring an anti-SLAPP suit.

Nor does it consider the portions of that newer anti-SLAPP statute stating that it protects the “right of free speech” and “the constitutional right of petition,” RCW 4.24.525(2)(e) — rights that the constitution grants to individuals against the government and not to the government against individuals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The legislature continued, “Such lawsuits, called ‘Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation’ or ‘SLAPPs,’ are typically dismissed as groundless or unconstitutional, but often not before the defendants are put to great expense, harassment, and interruption of their productive activities.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=43%20P.3d%204" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="43 P.3d 4">Id.</a> </em>§ 1(b).

It states, “The attorney general’s office or <em>any government body to which the moving party’s [communicative] acts were directed </em>may intervene to defend or otherwise support the moving party.” (Emphasis added.) <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>The statute thus expressly distinguishes the “moving party” from the “government body to which the moving party’s acts were directed.” Under the statute, Yakima would be free to intervene to “defend or otherwise support” the officers who submitted reports to the city, had Henne sued those officers. Certainly the officers themselves, had they been sued, would have standing to challenge the lawsuit under RCW 4.24.525. But the statute does not contemplate that the government body to which speech is directed may itself be a “moving party.” Instead, it recognizes that the <em>speaker </em>is the “moving party” and the governmental entity to which the speech is directed is not the “moving party.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Because Yakima is the government entity to which the speech at issue in this case was directed, and not the speaker, it cannot take advantage of RCW 4.24.525’s anti-SLAPP protections for speakers.</p>

Yakima is correct that RCW 4.24.525 is based in part on California’s similar law. As a result, commentators have noted, Washington “courts have begun using California law to interpret the Washington [anti-SLAPP] Act.” Wyrwich, <em>supra, </em>at 672.</p>
    <p id="b493-6" data-blocks='[["BL_493.7",493,[126,1792,1249,369]],["BL_494.1",494,[183,343,1257,376]]]'>¶22 But despite some similarities, the laws also have significant differences. <em>Id. </em>at 682 (noting that the Washington statute “differs in several respects” from the California statute). Most relevant to this case, the California anti-SLAPP statute states that it “shall be construed broadly.” Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(a). Our legislative findings, on the other hand, state, “This act shall be applied and <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>construed liberally to effectuate its general purpose of <em>protecting participants </em>in public controversies from an abusive use of the courts.” Laws op 2010, ch. 118, § 3 (emphasis added). Our legislature thus phrased its findings more narrowly than California’s, emphasizing that the protection extends to “participants” — the actors who speak out on public affairs.</p>
    <p id="b494-4" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[186,744,1252,922]]]'>¶23 Moreover, California’s case law does not address the question at issue here; that is, whether the government can take advantage of the anti-SLAPP statute when it was not even the speaker who exercised speech rights. To be sure, some California cases have found that a defendant governmental entity may bring an anti-SLAPP motion under California’s statute. <em>E.g., Bradbury v. Superior Court, </em><a href="/cal-app-4th/49/1108-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="49 Cal. App. 4th 1108" data-case-ids="4680209" data-case-paths="/cal-app-4th/49/1108-01">49 Cal.

Rptr. 2d 207</a> (1996) (“The anti-SLAPP suit statute is designed to protect the speech interests of private citizens, the public, and governmental speakers.”). And some California cases have found that a defendant governmental agency may rely on California’s anti-SLAPP statute even where it appears from the facts of the case that the governmental agency received, rather than made, communications. <em>E.g., Hansen v. Cal. Dep’t of Corn &amp; Rehab., </em><a href="/cal-app-4th/171/1537-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="171 Cal.

And even if California had considered the question and decided that its statute — a statute “designed to protect the speech interests of . . . governmental <em>speakers,” Bradbury, </em><a href="/cal-app-4th/49/1108-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="49 Cal.

For the sole and only purpose of ridding himself of his marriage vows, so solemnly assumed in 1913, appellee came to this State in May, 1932, and established himself in a Little Rock hotel and thereafter on November 7, 1932, filed this suit in the Pulaski Chancery Court alleging as grounds for divorce:</p>

    <p id="b974-5" data-blocks='[["BL_974.4",974,[295,727,1199,355]]]'>On the question of willful desertion but little need be said. The parties flatly contradicted each other as to desertion, and neither is corroborated by other testimony. Appellee insists, however, that the witness Hood corroborates his testimony as follows: “It was also evident that plaintiff was unable to persuade her to again take up residence with him, etc.”</p>
    <p id="b974-6" data-blocks='[["BL_974.5",974,[295,1104,1199,390]]]'>Just what evidence this witness referred to is not related by him, and we are unwilling to accept his conclusions as evidence. The law is definitely settled in this State that witnesses should be required to detail facts about which they testify, and the conclusions deducible therefrom are drawn by the courts. This witness testified to no fact corroborating the testimony of appellee as to willful desertion.</p>
    <p id="b974-7" data-blocks='[["BL_974.6",974,[293,1525,1205,903]]]'>The remaining contention is that the divorce decree is supported 'by sufficient testimony on the ground of indignities. As on the ground for desertion, we find that every charge and accusation made by appellee against appellant is flatly contradicted and denied by appellant in her testimony. Certainly, it can not be contended under these circumstances that either party is entitled to a divorce. The alleged corroboration of appellee’s testimony on this ground is predicated solely upon two or three occasions occurring at widely separated intervals. For instance, the first occurrence detailed by the witness Ford occurred in 1925, and is of no importance. Whatever petulance was shown by appellant on this occasion was thrust at Ford and his company and not at appellee. This testimony, instead of showing reproach, contempt or ridicule of or towards appellee, demonstrates appellant’s overpowering interest in her husband’s welfare.</p>

On this occasion one witness testified that appellant said to appellee: “I never enjoy anything when I am with yon.” This testimony falls far short of that required under the repeated decisions of this court to establish indignities.</p>

The interest of society demands that the bonds of wedlock should not be severed, except upon grounds prescribed by statute and established by testimony. One, two, or three trivial instances of petulance are entirely insufficient to establish indignities as defined by our statute.</p>

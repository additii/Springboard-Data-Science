At this point in time, the scene was secured, Powell was safely under control, and there was no need to further intrude on Flores’ liberty by ordering him to walk backwards to the sound of Officer Oiumette’s voice.” Resp’t’s Br. at 33.

The ACLU argues that under article I, section 7, there was no justification to seize Flores in the first place because the State “failed to provide an individualized objective rationale based on safety concerns.” Br. of Amicus Curiae ACLU of Wash. at 7.

The risks that companions pose to police attempting to arrest an individual are similar whether the companion and arrestee are in a car or on a sidewalk. The officer safety rationale that underlies our reasoning in <em>Mendez </em>and <em>Parker </em>applies with equal force whenever officers make an arrest. We therefore adopt the objective rationale test for when an officer may seize companions to control the scene of an arrest. When that test is met, it is not a violation of article I, section 7 for an officer to seize a nonarrested companion of an arrestee. The objective rationale test was met under the facts of this case. We therefore reverse the Court of Appeals and hold that the evidence of the gun should not have been suppressed.</p>

As explained, the fact that the seizures in <em>Mendez </em>and <em>Parker </em>occurred in the vehicle context was not central to the analysis. To determine which standard we use to evaluate the legality of a seizure, we do not focus on the seizure’s location; rather, we focus on its <em>purpose. See, e.g., Mendez, </em>137 Wn.2d at 220 <em>(“Terry </em>must be met if the purpose of the officer’s interaction with the passenger is investigatory. For purposes of controlling the scene of the traffic stop and to preserve safety there, we apply the standard of an objective rationale.”). Where the stop is for investigative purposes, we require officers to meet the <em>Terry </em>standard of individualized, reasonable, articulable suspicion. <em>See, e.g., State v. Fuentes, </em><a href="/wash-2d/183/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="183 Wash. 2d 149" data-case-ids="6792300" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/183/0149-01">183 Wn.2d 149</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=352%20P.3d%20152" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="352 P.3d 152">352 P.3d 152</a> (2015) (applying the <em>Terry </em>standard to determine whether officers had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to engage in two investigative stops outside an apartment complex); <em>Horrace, </em>144 Wn.2d at 394 (applying <em>Terry, </em>a pedestrian case, to determine the validity of a stop-and-frisk of a vehicle passenger because the officer’s conduct was “investigatory”).

Yet another standard exists when an officer engages in a purported social contact. In those situations, we determine if the contact was in fact a seizure—rather than merely a social contact—based on whether a reasonable person would believe he was not free to leave. <em>See, e.g., State v. Young, </em><a href="/wash-2d/135/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="135 Wash. 2d 498" data-case-ids="812858" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/135/0498-01">135 Wn.2d 498</a>, 513-14, <a href="/citations/?q=957%20P.2d%20681" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="957 P.2d 681">957 P.2d 681</a> (1998) (holding shining a spotlight on an individual “did not amount to such a show of authority a reasonable person would have believed he or she was not free to leave” and thus was not a seizure).

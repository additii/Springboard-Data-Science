    <p id="b86-8" data-blocks='[["BL_86.7",86,[311,1004,1204,1067]]]'>Appellant’s first insistence for reversal of the judgment is that the evidence was insufficient to carry the issue of limitation by adverse possession to the jury. Appellant argues that appellee never expressly disclaimed or repudiated the interest of her co-tenant, Sallie Winston, or by acts tantamount thereto notified Sallie Winston that she was claiming adversely to her, and that for this reason the court erred in submitting the issue of limitations to the jury, and should have peremptorily instructed for appellant. Appellant fails to give full effect and purport to the testimony of appellee. Appellee testified that it was agreed between herself and sister, Sallie Winston, that she should pay the taxes and take the land, and that pursuant to such agreement she did pay the taxes and occupy the land thereafter adversely to her sister. In this appellant was, to some extent, corroborated by the testimony of several of her neighbors. While appellee’s evidence was to some extent unsatisfactory, on account of contradictions in it, yet it was sufficient 'to carry the claim of adverse possession to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b86-9" data-blocks='[["BL_86.8",86,[312,2085,1200,253]],["BL_87.1",87,[151,383,1206,868]]]'>Another ground insisted upon by appellant for reversal of the judgment is that the court excluded the evidence of J. S. Jones in reference to the partition suit filed by him for appellee and her sister against their brother, Andy Berry, in the Conway Chancery Court. <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>The evidence in this respect in the record was not as broad as the allegation in the motion for a new trial. In other words, the record does not support this allegation in the motion for a new trial. If the testimony disclosed ¡by the record had 'been to the effect that J. S. Jones had 'brought a suit for partition of the land in question for appellee and her sister against their brother, it would have been error to exclude it, because appellee’s evidence tended to show that her husband was looking after and making contracts concerning the land for her; but the evidence excluded by the court was not developed to this extent. It was only attempted to be shown by Jones that he went to Morrilton to see some one about dividing the land, and he himself testified in response to the court’s question that he was not representing his wife on that occasion. We do not think the court erred in excluding the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b87-5" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[151,1281,1204,1083]],["BL_88.1",88,[313,382,1206,1177]]]'>Appellant also insists on reversing the judgment because the court refused to grant a new trial for newly discovered evidence set forth in the amendment to the motion for a new trial. Appellee suggests that the court properly overruled the motion because, first, it was not shown ‘why the new evidence was not discovered before the trial, and second, that diligence was not used in discovering it before the trial. The evidence ■was not of that character which could be discovered before it was disclosed by the witness W. H. Duff, It is stated in the motion that W. H. Duff did not communicate the fact to appellant until after the rendition of the judgment. The motion also states that for that reason the same was not obtained and used in the trial of said cause. We think the motion sufficiently shows why the evidence was not discovered before the trial, and, inferentially, why more diligence was not used than was used in procuring it. Again, appellee suggests that the evidence is cumulative, and for that reason the court properly overruled the motion for a new trial. The newly discovered evidence was in the nature of an admission made by ap<a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>pellee that her sister, Sallie Winston, owned an undivided one-third interest in the land. It tended to break down the evidence of appellee. Appellee’s whole case rested upon the truth of her own testimony. According to her testimony, she had a contract or agreement with her sister by which she was to pay the taxes and take the property. In other words, appellee fixed a time by contract at which the statute of limitations began to run against her sister. No other witness testified to this fact. Her sister denied it. It is true there was evidence in the record tending to show that appellee had made several mortgages of an undivided one-third interest in said property as security for borrowed money, but the newly discovered evidence to the effect that she joined her sister in an oil lease on said land, and at the time stated that her sister had an interest in the land, is more definite and certain than any other evidence which had been introduced, contradicting her statement that she had claimed title to and occupied the land for more than seven years adversely to her brother and sister. In fact, it was independent evidence, not in any sense cumulative, tending to contradict and break down appellee’s own evidence upon which she relied for recovery.</p>
    <p id="b88-3" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[316,1570,1202,188]]]'>Other assignments of error are insisted upon for a reversal of the judgment, but as they will not likely occur upon a new trial we deem it unnecessary to discuss them.</p>

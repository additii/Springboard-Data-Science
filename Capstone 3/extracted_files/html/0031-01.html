The facts in both cases are substantially identical, and a statement of the facts in one case will suffice to present also the question for decision in the other.</p>

Numerous conferences were held by the members of the board in regard to the real estate assessments, and certain property was inspected. The board reached the conclusion that, owing to the general depression, there had been a considerable deflation in all values, and in the value of real estate in particular, especially as compared with the valuations existing at the time of the assessment for the year 1929 was made. After considering each parcel of city property and real estate separately, the board reached the conclusion that a separate and several reduction of the assessed value of each city lot and tract of <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>land in the entire county of 25 per cent, should he made, and the county clerk was directed to extend the assessed valuations against each city lot and tract of land upon the tax books, in accordance with this decision.</p>
    <p id="b52-3" data-blocks='[["BL_52.4",52,[315,571,1200,100]]]'>Having reached this conclusion, the board of equalization made the following order:</p>

(25%) from the assessment as determined by the tax assessor and equalization of such assessment as heretofore made, and the clerk of the county court is hereby ordered and directed to place opposite each parcel or tract of land in St. Francis County, after the assessment against said land, town or city lot, a sum equal to seventy-five per cent. (75%) of the assessment as now extended on said assessor’s book, and that the assessment so reduced be copied into the tax books when the same is made up for the use of the collector of the revenue for St. Francis County for the year 1931.</p>

W. 571</a>. In that case the quorum court had, at the instance of the board of equalization, entered a “blanket reduction of the assessed valuation of the lands in the county.” The equalization board had not in that case made an equalization and reduction of the separate assessments of each piece of real property in the county, but had made an order reducing the assessments of all real estate in the county. We held that neither the equalization board nor the quorum court had the power to make this blanket reduction. We held, however, that the property owners were not prejudiced by this order, as it'had been made for their benefit.</p>

The question for decision is therefore whether the Tax Commission had the right <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>to review this action, of the equalization boards and to order its rescission.</p>

    <p id="b54-4" data-blocks='[["BL_54.5",54,[296,614,1203,704]]]'>By the act of 1929 it is provided that real property, situated within the boundaries of any city or town, shall be assessed biennially, beginning in 1929, in the odd-numbered years, and that other real estate, beginning in 1930, shall be assessed biennially in the even numbered years. The assessments here under review, having been made in an odd numbered year, there was no assessment of real property except that within the boundaries of the cities and towns to be equalized, and the equalization board had therefore no function to perform in regard to the assessment of other real estate. It was said in the case of <em>Summers </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>that the equalization board had no power to equalize assessments except -for the year in which they were made.</p>
    <p id="b54-5" data-blocks='[["BL_54.6",54,[298,1322,1203,1048]]]'>The act of 1929 does make provision for the assessment of both urban and rural property, in either odd or even numbered years, in certain cases. By § 4 of this act, § 9918, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, is amended to permit the assessment each year of forfeited lands that have been redeemed, and lands previously exempt from taxation which have become subject to taxation, all new improvements exceeding one hundred dollars in value, all acreage lands that have been. platted as city or town lots, and all real estate or improvements thereon which have been damaged by fire, flood, tornado or other act of God. But it is not contended that the action of the equalization board in either county is related to or derived from this power of special assessments. Nor is it contended that the deflated values of either county was caused by any other condition peculiar to those counties. The depression about which the members of the equalization board testified, which had caused the deflation in values and which induced their action, prevails throughout the State, and is not confined to its boundaries.</p>

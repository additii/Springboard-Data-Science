It is insisted, first, that the evidence is not sufficient to support the verdict. Notwithstanding appellant testified in his own behalf and denied any participation in the robbery, the truth of the defense was, of course, a question for the jury, and has been settled by its verdict against the appellant upon testimony sufficient to support the verdict. <em>Norrid </em>v. <em>State, ante </em>p. 32.</p>

It was shown that three of the jurors had served on a jury in the Danville district of Tell County within two years last past at the August, 1931, term of court, one on <a id="p833" href="#p833" data-label="833" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*833</a>the grand jury and two as members of the petit jury. It does not appear that any of these jurors were challenged as disqualified for service upon the impaneling of the jury; and no error was committed in overruling the motion to quash the indictment on that ground. The statute provides that no indictment “shall be void or voidable because any of the grand jury failed to possess any of the qualifications required by law.” Section 3030, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest; <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/185/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="185 Ark. 147" data-case-ids="1435168" data-case-paths="/ark/185/0147-01">185 Ark. 147</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20S.W.2d%2037" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="46 S.W.2d 37">46 S.

    <p id="b851-3" data-blocks='[["BL_851.4",851,[173,874,1207,1025]]]'>The fifth assignment of error is to the effect that the court erred in overruling a motion for a continuance based on the fact that one of appellant’s attorneys, Mr. Horton, was a member of the General Assembly and required to be in attendance at the extraordinary session between August 14 and 24. It appears that Mr. Horton was the representative from Logan County and appellant’s regular attorney, and had been employed to defend him in the instant case; and also that Mr. Horton employed Mr. May, of the Booneville bar, to assist in representing appellant, and, within a few days after appellant was arrested, also employed Mr. B. F. Madole, of Danville, who appeared at the examining trial and all three of the attorneys appeared before the judge of the circuit court seeking a reduction of the amount of the bond set for appellant. The crime was committed on June 19, and the General Assembly did not convene until August 14, and the trial of appellant did not take place until August 27, several days after the adjouiument of the General Assembly.</p>

We do not regard it necessary now to determine whether it relates only to civil suits, since the attorney employed to defend the appellant, recognizing that he would probably be engaged otherwise, employed the services of two attorneys at the bar of the court to assist in representing appellant, and both of them were present and participated in the trial. Appellant could not have been prejudiced by reason of the trial taking place 3 days after the adjournment of the Legislature and was not deprived of the services of counsel of his own choice, the assistants chosen by his chief counsel conducting the trial. No prejudice was shown to have resulted on account of it, and the. court did not err in refusing the eontinuánce under the circumstances.</p>

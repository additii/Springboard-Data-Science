K.H.-H. and C.R. were sitting on C.R.’s bed when K.H.-H. began to kiss her on the face and neck. She responded by telling K.H.-H. to “chill it or to back off.” Verbatim Tr. of Proceedings (Aug. 13, 2013) (VTP) at 29. Undeterred, K.H.-H. pushed C.R. onto her back, leaned over her, and began biting her neck. C.R. protested, tried to push K.H.-H. away, and told him to “stop” and to get off her, and that it hurt. VTP at 35. K.H.-H. “pushed his weight down more on [her] hands,” reached under her shirt and bra in an attempt to touch her breasts, and reached into and “tr[ied] to undo [her] pants.” VTP at 32, 33. C.R. grabbed her cell phone and threatened to call her father, prompting K.H.-H. to leave the house. C.R. noticed bruises on her neck from the bites and showed the marks to her friend, J.S. J.S. confronted K.H.-H. about the incident and then informed a school official.</p>

At the disposition hearing, the State requested the court order K.H.-H. to address to C.R. “a sincere written letter of apology ... meanfing] an admission that he did what he was accused of what he’s [sic] doing and [is] sorry he put her in that position.” VTP at 149.

The officers posited that the apology requirement violated their First Amendment right to refrain from speaking. In rejecting this argument, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged the broad discretion a sentencing judge has in setting probation conditions, reasoning that “even where preferred rights are affected, [the test] is ‘whether the limitations are primarily designed to affect the rehabilitation of the probationer or insure the protection of the public.’” <em>Clark, </em><a href="/f2d/918/0843-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="918 F.2d 843" data-case-ids="10537782" data-case-paths="/f2d/918/0843-01">918 F.2d at 848</a> (quoting <em>United States v.

The State argued in <em>Bahl </em>that Washington law required that sentencing conditions be only “crime-related” to be valid. This court held that both federal and state law required more connection (or nexus) before conditions that infringe on constitutional rights may be imposed.

Thus, conditions may be imposed that restrict free speech rights if reasonably necessary, but they must be sensitively imposed. This meshes with the vagueness doctrine’s principle that where the challenged law involves First Amendment rights, a greater degree of specificity may be demanded.

The record in this case supports our conclusion that the juvenile court imposed the letter of apology condition for the purpose of rehabilitating K.H.-H. Specifically, the court was concerned that K.H.-H. refused to accept the consequences of his harmful conduct.

But it is our most recent case in the most analogous context, and it is neither incorrect nor harmful; hence, it remains controlling (and persuasive) authority. <em>Bahl </em>holds that a probation condition like the one in this case violates the First Amendment unless it <em>both </em>serves an “important government interest” <em>and </em>is “narrowly tailored” and “necessary to achieving that interest.” If the majority really applied that test here, the probation condition could not survive. According to the juvenile court, the governmental purpose for ordering K.H.-H. to write a letter of apology was to address K.H.-H.’s pattern of disrespect toward younger women. VTP (Aug. 28, 2013) at 156-57. But the juvenile court could have addressed this concern without infringing on K.H.-H.’s First Amendment rights—and could have done so far more effectively. For example, the court could have required K.H.-H. to write an essay on the lifelong effects that rape has on young victims.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">10</a> Instead, the court ordered K.H.-H. to write a letter of apology that includes a confession of wrongdoing. <em>See </em>CP at 52; VTP (Aug. 28, 2013) at 149. This is not narrowly tailored or necessary. As the Supreme Court has explained, it is one thing to provide education that tends to inspire a specific belief; it is another to short-cut this effort altogether with the substitution of a compulsory statement. <em>Barnette, </em><a href="/us/319/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="319 U.S. 624" data-case-ids="366560" data-case-paths="/us/319/0624-01">319 U.S. at 631</a>.</p>

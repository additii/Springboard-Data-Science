Terry and Lee Miles, as chairman, and H. Gr. Combs, as secretary, of the Democratic State Central Committee, the complaint in which contained the following allegations: A Democratic primary election was held on September 26, 1933, in the Fifth Congressional District of Arkansas, for the purpose of nominating a Democratic candidate for Congress in said district. The district is composed of Pulaski, Franklin, Yell and five other counties. At this election the plaintiff, Hays, and the defendant, Terry, were the only candidates. The total number of votes cast in said election, as tabulated and certified to by the various county central committees, was 18,927, of which number Terry received 9,776 .votes, and Hays 9,151 votes, giving Terry an apparent majority of 625.</p>

It was also alleged that Terry had paid money to various <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>persons in Yell, Pulaski and Franklin counties for soliciting votes for Terry, in violation of § 3902, Crawford &amp; Moses ’ Digest.</p>

The chairman and secretary of the State Central Committee will cast up such returns, based on said certificates, and certify the nominee to the State Election Board.”</p>

The act has not deprived the party authorities of the right and duty to determine, in the first instance, who its nominee is for any particular office. The act does confer the jurisdiction upon the courts to review that finding, which review may be made upon an inquiry into any and all relevant facts tending to show which candidate received the majority of the legal votes. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Knowlton, </em><a href="/ark/183/1127-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="183 Ark. 1127" data-case-ids="1441875" data-case-paths="/ark/183/1127-01">183 Ark. 1127</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20S.W.2d%20450" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="40 S.W.2d 450">40 S.

    <p id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[289,954,1202,905]]]'>But, if the court has this power in the contest of a special primary election, it has the same power in a contest growing out of a regular primary, and, if so, delay in deciding the contest might operate in having an election held at which the party would have no candidate for the contested office. The law fixes the time when regular primary elections shall be held and general elections following them, and the courts are without power to change those dates, and, if the courts may prevent party committees from certifying the result of a primary election pending its own review and final determination of a contest, it might frequently happen that the party would have no nominee entitled to have his name placed upon the ticket as such, and a general election, which the courts cannot postpone, would result in the election of some person running independently of a party nomination, or as the nominee of another party, in which event the contest would be fruitless to all persons concerned.</p>

The party does have a candidate under the case stated, that person being the candidate who has been certified by the appropriate party committee as the party nominee. This is made clear by the provisions of § 15 of the act of 1917, which appears as § 3776, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest. This section provides that, if the person certified by the appropriate committee to be the party nominee is elected at the general election, and it is later determined, after the contest has been heard and decided, that he was not entitled to the nomination, “then such judgment” (that he was not entitled to the nomination) “shall operate as an ouster from.office, and the vacancy in it shall be filled as provided by law for filling vacancies in such office in case of death or resignation.”</p>

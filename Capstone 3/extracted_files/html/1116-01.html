      <em>The </em>rule is stated thus in 31 C.

Notice was not made a condition precedent to the right of recovery under the certificate and policy here under consideration therefore a suit may be brought and maintained within the statutory period of limitations. Forfeitures cannot and should not be declared when the rights of parties have become vested, therefore the payment or nonpayment of premiums subsequent to causation of the injury is immaterial. We conclude therefore that the judgment in favor of appellee under policy S API-534 is right, and should be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b1138-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1138.5",1138,[303,1473,1197,651]]]'>Appellant contends that no liability attached under certificate No. 24,314 issued under master policy G--2377 until proof of disability was filed with the company, and approved by it showing appellee to have been disabled for a period of six consecutive months. In other words, the contention is, that liability did not attach on this certificate until six consecutive months’ disability had elapsed, and that the payment of premiums during this six months ’ period was a condition precedent to the right of recovery. The jury has found under proper instruction, and, appellant tacitly admits, upon sufficient evidence that appellee was totally and permanently disabled prior to August 31,1931.</p>

The monthly premium on certificate 24,314 was sixty cents per month, and on September 1, 1931, when the <a id="p1121" href="#p1121" data-label="1121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1121</a>premium should have been paid, appellant had in its possession sufficient funds belonging to appellee under policy SAH-534 to have paid this premium.

The Legislature of 19'21 passed an act for a stock law embracing all of Chicot County, and all that part of Ashley County lying east of Bayou Bartholomew. The Legislature thereafter repealed that part of this local law that applied to Ashley County, and the local law no longer applied to the territory in Ashley County, but such territory was thereafter under the operation of the general law. No one would contend that the Legislature could have added other territory to this local act after the adoption of amendment No. 14.

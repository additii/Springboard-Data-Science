This case must be reversed because of the error of the trial court in giving to the jury instructions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 on behalf of appellee. It will be noted that instruction No. <em>1, </em>given on behalf of appellee, ignores all the defenses offered by appellant, that is to say, the defenses of assumption of risk, contributory negligence and the release of liability. Each of these instructions directed the jury to return a verdict in favor of appellee on the hypothesis therein stated, wholly ignoring the defenses of assumption of risk, contributory negligence and a valid release. It is insisted, on behalf of appellee, that this error was cured because the court specifically told the jury in an instruction that they should consider all the instructions given as a whole. This exact question was before this court in the ease of <em>Natural Gas &amp; Fuel Co. </em>v. <em>Lyles, </em><a href="/ark/174/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="174 Ark. 146" data-case-ids="8719004" data-case-paths="/ark/174/0146-01">174 Ark. 146</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=294%20S.W.%20395" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="294 S.W. 395">294 S.

    <p id="b384-6" data-blocks='[["BL_384.9",384,[284,1766,1202,654]]]'>The defenses of assumed risk, contributory negligence and a valid release all were outstanding in favor of appellant at all stages of this proceeding, and, before the jury should have been instructed to find for appellee, it should have been conditioned upon each of these defenses. In other words, if appellee had executed a valid release, this should have impelled a verdict for appellant; or if appellee had assumed the risk of this collision, the verdict'of the jury should have been for appellant; or if appellee’s contributory negligence, if any, was greater than the negligence of Clyde White, if any,.a verdict should have been returned in favor of appellant. Instructions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 wholly ignored these defenses.</p>

      <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>This court held in the Lyles cases, cited <em>supra, </em>on this exact question: “Appellee contends that the omission in the two instructions to take into account appellant’s defenses of contributory negligence and the assumption of the risk by appellee was cured by instructions numbers 2 and 4 requested by appellant and given by the court. Number 2 related to contributory negligence, and number 4 to the assumption of the risk, and would have cured the defect, had the court not told the jury in both cases to render a verdict in favor of appellee in case they found that appellant was guilty of negligence as alleged. This declaration on the part of the court created a conflict between the two instructions given at the request of appellee and instructions 2 and 4 given at the request of appellant. <em>Southern Anthracite Co. </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em><a href="/ark/93/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="93 Ark. 140" data-case-ids="1546845" data-case-paths="/ark/93/0140-01">93 Ark. 140</a>, 151-152, <a href="/citations/?q=124%20S.W.%201048" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="124 S.W. 1048">124 S.

It is insisted here, and will probably be insisted on a new trial, that the trial court should have directed a verdict in favor of appellant because, as it is said, the testimony of appellee. was false and not worthy of belief wherein he testified that his brother, Clyde White, grabbed the steering wheel and turned the truck into the path of the touring car driven by Holland. This contention is bottomed upon the theory that appellee had testified in two previous trials, in neither of wdiich he had testified to the same state of facts and circumstances. On this question, it suffices to say that, under our system of government, the trial jury is the sole and unfettered judges of the credibility of witnesses and the weight that should be given to their testimony.</p>

The circumstances surrounding this release are to the effect that, when a person is employed by appellant, he is furnished with what is denominated a “blue book,” wherein it is delineated that the employees of appellant upon receiving disability while in the employ of appellant, shall receive certain benefits therein explained and described. After receipt of the injuries herein complained of, appellant sent to appellee, -at Forrest City, certain papers to be executed by him, in reference to the acceptance or rejection of this plan. Appellee testified, in effect, that he did not read the details of these instructions, but assumed that they were for the purposes purported in the letter, that is to say, to enable him to draw his wages while suffering from his injuries. He further testified, in effect, that he did not know, and had no intention of releasing his cause of action when he <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>signed the papers.

We think the trial court was correct in submitting this question to the jury, and that the instructions given in this behalf were correct declarations of law. We are unwilling to say, under all the facts and circumstances in this case, that the paper signed by appellee was a voluntary release as a matter of law. Section 7147, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, provides: “Any contract, rule, regulation or device whatsoever, the purpose or intent of which shall be to enable any such corporation to exempt itself from any liability created by this act, shall to that extent be void. Provided, that in any action broug'ht against any such corporation under or by virtue of any of the provisions of this act, such corporations may set off therein any sum it has contributed or paid to any insurance relief benefit, or indemnity that may have been paid to the injured employee or the person entitled thereto on account of the injury or death for which said action was brought.”</p>

If he should think that the accident was unavoidable, for which no one was to blame, or if it was occasioned by one of those'risks ordinarily incident to the employment Avhich he had assumed, or if it was his own carelessness, and that only, which occasioned the accident, he might take advantage of the plan and recover the benefits.thereunder, although there was no legal liability of'the employer to respond in damages; whereas, if he should determine or be of the opinion that the accident Avas the result of some negligent act of the agents <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>or employees of the company for which it was legally responsible, he might bring his action at law, and, if liability was established, recover such damages as would fully and fairly compensate him for the injury received.</p>

On the last-mentioned date, while lifting a heavy weight, he suffered a rupture, necessitating an operation which kept him from work for a month or longer. On December 30, 1931, he executed a release precisely like the one he had executed on March 20, 1930, which he now claims was fraudulently procured. After his recovery from the rupture he was again employed by the company, and was given light work to do, but finally, several months thereafter, he was discharged. About four months thereafter he brought this suit — a total period of two years and seven months having elapsed after the date on which he alleges the injury occurred from'which his present disability results.</p>

Instead of that, he took advantage of a similar release over a year after he had signed the first. It is my opinion that the plan adopted by the company is fair and not in violation of any law; that there is not a scintilla of evidence to show that any unfair advantage was taken of the appellee in the procurement of the release, or any fraud practiced upon him. On the contrary, he knew, or should have known, just what he was doing, and his acts are binding upon him. Furthermore, if there was any evidence to show an unfair advantage taken of appellee in the procurement of the release by his acceptance of its benefits and his delay for a period of two years and seven months to take any steps to disaffirm his contract, it is now binding upon him, and this case should be reversed and dismissed.</p>

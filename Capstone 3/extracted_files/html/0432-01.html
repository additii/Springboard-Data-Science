These tenants raised eleven bales of cotton on appellant’s land, and sold eight of them to John Adkins, a buyer for appellee, the Lesser-Goldman Cotton Company. It does not appear whether the cotton bought by Adkins brought enough to pay the rent, but appellee was sued for the rent on the theory that the cotton bought exceeded the rent, and that appellee had become liable for the rent by purchasing the cotton. Appellee admitted buying the cotton, but alleged that its agent bought the cotton in the open market, in the usual course of business, and without actual knowledge that there was a landlord’s lien thereon. The court dismissed the bill as being without equity, and this appeal is from that decree.</p>

For the law is that, while one buying cotton <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>subject to a landlord’s- lien is not liable as for conversion if he has.,no knowledge of the lien, yet ifthe,■.purchaser- is in possession of facts sufficient to.- put -him-upon notice that the cotton is subject to -the-lien' of ,-'a;-. landlord, good faith requires him to pursue the, inquiry.' to the extent of investigating the facts of which he has-knowledge, and, if reasonable diligence in the investigation of these facts would have led to the knowledge of the actual existence of the lien, then the purchaser is, liable for a conversion, just as he would have been had, he possessed the actual knowledge. The act of purchasring the cotton destroys the landlord’s lien, and. pne.pan-. not do this and escape liability for so doing except, when he has acted in good faith in making the purchase, and good faith requires a reasonable investigation .of any. information of which the purchaser has., possession calculated to warn him that he is being offered cotton upon which there exists a landlord’s lien. <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em><a href="/ark/103/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="103 Ark. 91" data-case-ids="1352003" data-case-paths="/ark/103/0091-01">103 Ark. 91</a>; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Myar, </em><a href="/citations/?q=95%20Ark.%2037" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="95 Ark. 37">95 Ark. 37</a>; <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Brandon, </em><a href="/ark/70/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="70 Ark. 79" data-case-ids="1509431" data-case-paths="/ark/70/0079-01">70 Ark. 79</a>; <em>Merchants &amp; Planters’ Bank </em>v.

Upon being advised of this fact, Craven demanded the rent of Adkins, who refused to pay it, whereupon this, suit was brought. Thereafter a representative of appellee wrote Craven advising him that the McGuires had other.cotton on the place out of which he could make a part, at least, of the rent, but no action was taken in regard to that cotton.</p>

No sir.” And upon his cross-examination he testified as follows: “Q. You say you didn’t know whether this cotton came off of rented land or not? A. No sir. Q. You knew the McGuires rented some of the land, didn’t you? A. No sir. I. kñew probably they were renting land, but I didn’t know who they-were renting from. Q. You knew they were renting from somebody? A. No, I didn’t know that. I didn’t know whether they were renting any land or not. Q. You half-way believed it, didn’t you? A. No; I didn’t know.

Yes, I know some that rent land and some that don’t. Q. How long have you been engaged in business in that neighborhood? A. I have been buying cotton there 12 or 15 years. Q.

Oh, I would go in there, maybe, once or twice a day, I don’t know, but I didn’t have any connection with it in the way of working there.” And on his redirect examination he testified as follows: “Q. When you paid off over there, you paid off just for the convenience of your customers, didn’t you? A. I gave a ticket, and they could go anywhere they wanted to go and get the money. Q.

This land became valuable oil producing property. The appellee, prior to December, 1931, had executed conveyances to all of her interests in these lands. In an effort to recover some interest in the property, she gave a power of attorney to J. R. Cheek.</p>

Appellant filed a bond as guardian in the sum of $200, with G. F. Walker, husband of Belle Walker, and Walter L. Brown, attorney, as his sureties. After appellant was appointed guardian, he entered into a contract with Walter L. Brown, attorney, to represent him in recovering his ward’s interest in the property in Texas, and agreed to pay Brown one-half of any amount recovered. Brown then employed the appellant to investigate the facts.</p>

The Sinclair Oil &amp; Gas Company gave Cheek and Belle Walker each a. draft for $7,500. Walter L. Brown, after appellee had indorsed her draft and delivered it to him, gave her his check for $3,750. Brown indorsed the Sinclair draft and delivered it to appellant with instructions to deposit $3,750 to Brown’s account to cover the Walker check. Appellant paid Brown $600 and a lawyer in Texas, where the case was tried, $300, and of the $3,750, the appellant received $2,850 in addition to what he paid the attorneys.</p>

    <p id="b181-5" data-blocks='[["BL_181.4",181,[146,448,1198,514]]]'>Appellant filed a demurrer to the complaint alleging that the court had no jurisdiction, and filed answer alleging that as a matter of fact Belle Walker never was insane, and that she was adjudged sane by the district court of Gregg County, Texas; denied that he collected any money for her as guardian or otherwise; denied that he had converted $3,750 to his own use, and denied his insolvency. The chancery court found in favor of appellee in the sum of $2,882.22, and the case is here on appeal.</p>

    <p id="b181-7" data-blocks='[["BL_181.6",181,[144,1274,1208,499]]]'>The appellant who, as guardian, made the contract with Brown, the attorney, was not a lawyer, but a physician practicing at Smackover, Arkansas. Appellant claims that he spent about five or six weeks in Texas investigating the matter, and spent considerable money.. He does not, however, testify as to what he spent money for, nor does he claim to have kept any account of the amounts expended. Mr. Brown made a trip out to Texas when the suit was tried in Gregg County, but he spent very little, and is not claiming anything in this suit.</p>
    <p id="b181-8" data-blocks='[["BL_181.7",181,[142,1777,1203,544]]]'>It is earnestly contended by appellant that the probate court alone had jurisdiction, and he relies on the Constitution and laws of Arkansas. The constitutional provision relied on reads as follows: “The judge of the county court shall be the judge of the court of probate, and have such exclusive original jurisdiction in matters relative to the probate of wills, the estates of deceased persons, executors, administrators, guardians and persons of unsound mind and their estates as is now vested in the circuit court, or may be hereafter prescribed by law.” Constitution, article 7, § 34.</p>

    <p id="b182-6" data-blocks='[["BL_182.5",182,[299,652,1201,497]]]'>This suit did not involve the estate of a person of unsound mind, because both the Texas court and the probate court of Union County had declared the appellee sane, and the appellant himself testified that she had never been insane. Therefore this suit did not involve a person of unsound mind, or the estate of a person of unsound mind. It did not involve any settlement or allowance of the accounts of executors, administrators or guardians, and therefore the authorities relied on by appellant have no application.</p>
    <p id="b182-7" data-blocks='[["BL_182.6",182,[300,1159,1199,453]]]'>It was not claimed by the appellant in this suit that the appellee was insane. There is no doubt from the record that the guardian was appointed for Belle Walker for no other purpose than to assist in getting the conveyances theretofore made by Belle Walker set aside, so that she might recover her interests in the Texas lands. There was nothing for the probate court to do, and this suit does not involve any matters that are within the jurisdiction of the probate court.</p>

But their power and functions to relieve against fraud, accident, mistake or impending irremediable mischief, is universal; extending over suitors in all courts, and over the decrees of those courts, obtained by fraud, .or rendered under circumstances which render it inequitable that they should be inforced. Hence any frauds in the settlements of administrators or executors may be corrected. When that is done, if there be still a necessity for continued proceedings in the course of administration, such proceeding should go on in the probate court, upon the basis of the reformed settlement. The object of chancery intervention having been accomplished, the jurisdiction in equity should cease with the necessity. Otherwise the courts <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>of chancery might make themselves courts of probate, in violation of the spirit and intention of the Constitution. If however there be no continuing necessity for a further course of administration; if the assets be collected in, and the debts be all ascertained, and nothing remains but to fix the liabilities of administrators, executors, and their sureties, and the rights of creditors, legatees and distributees, and to make adjustment on equitable principles, all that business comes within the more facile and effective operation of the remedial processes peculiar to equity practice. ’ ’ <em>Reinhardt </em>v. <em>Gartrell, </em><a href="/ark/33/0727-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="33 Ark. 727" data-case-ids="8726071" data-case-paths="/ark/33/0727-01">33 Ark. 727</a>.

There are no assets to be collected, and, so far as the record shows, there are no debts, and nothing remains to be done by the probate court. The record however in this case shows that the Texas court and the probate court of Union County had both declared Belle Walker sane. The judgment of the probate court in Union County declaring her sane was in January, 1931. This suit was begun about five months after she was adjudged sane by the Union County Probate Court.</p>

Appellant’s substation is located a short dis-' tance west of the 'Bransford gin, and appellee alleged that appellant negligently inclosed the substation by a light net and barbed-wire fence on property upon and about which children are accustomed to play, its surroundings being attractive to children, and that this fact was well known to the appellant; that on the sixth day of July, 1931, George Kilpatrick, Jr., in passing said property, was attracted to same, and the fence surrounding the substation was inadequate, insufficient, and negligently constructed, and enabled the said George Kilpatrick, Jr., to climb through same and into said inclosure, where the transformers and high-tension wires were located, said property being unguarded; that George Kilpatrick, Jr., was seven years of age, and unaware and unwarned of the danger concealed in the wires; he, childlike, climbed upon said transformers, and came in contact with said uninsulated high-tension wires, and was severely injured.</p>

These authorities hold that one who maintains upon his place, and permits to remain exposed, something dangerous when approached or used, and of such an attractive character that he knows, or, as a reasonable prudent man should know, will invite the attention of children and draw them to it, because of their sportive and playful natures, impliedly invites them to come; that in exposing such an instrumentality, with the knowledge that it will attract children, he occupies the same position when they come as if he had beckoned them and they followed. We are not here discussing the question of contributory negligence on the part of the child. We will assume the child is too young to be chargeable with negligence. We are not dealing with a trespassing child, for no one is a trespasser who comes by invitation of the owner. As the <a id="p684" href="#p684" data-label="684" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*684</a>cases of attractive nuisance seem to rest upon the thought that, exposing anything of a character that appeals to children’s nature, and by appealing draws them to it, is, in its very nature, an implied invitation to them to come. It is not material in an inquiry of this kind whether the children had been accustomed to come or not; whether it had remained a long time or a short time.” <em>Wilmes </em>v. <em>Chicago, Great Northern Ry.

The various houses, buildings, hull piles, etc., to which the majority refer as being in the neighborhood of the substation, were, with it, situated upon a plot of ground four blocks in area with, out intervening streets. In other words, there would have been four blocks had there been intervening streets to so divide the land.</p>

No witness testified that any child had ever been seen within this inclosure. The father of the injured boy testified that it had never occurred to him that a child would play within the inclosure where the transformer was located. This was, of course, because of the presence of the fence. Why, then, should any such danger have been anticipated by any other person? Children did play upon these four blocks and on the various objects thereon, as stated by the majority, but no one had ever seen a child within the inclosure containing the transformer.</p>

But the majority opinion recites the fact that the man who first reached the boy found the gate fastened, and that he was required to push it down to obtain <a id="p688" href="#p688" data-label="688" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*688</a>access. Just what force was required to accomplish this purpose is not shown. But the condition of the gate is unimportant, as it is certain that entrance to the transformer was not had through the gate.</p>
    <p id="b708-3" data-blocks='[["BL_708.4",708,[301,589,1203,552]]]'>The fence enclosing the transformer consisted of three strands of a mesh wire, each strand being twenty-six inches wide, which made a mesh fence six and one-half feet high. There is no contention that access was obtained through the mesh, as they were too small to make that possible. Above this wire fence four strands of barbed wire extended outward on cross-arms, so that the entire fence was about ten feet high. It was these barbed wires above the mesh fence which could be extended so that an intervening space of two feet would exist between them.</p>
    <p id="b708-4" data-blocks='[["BL_708.5",708,[301,1165,1202,711]]]'>No witness saw the boys enter the inclosure. The injured boy was not offered as a witness, and the testimony of his companion, offered by defendant, was excluded on account of his youth. The offer was made to show by this excluded testimony that the boys climbed the fence to get a bird’s nest, and later climbed down into the inelosure. This bird’s nest was in a corner post (a sawed-off telephone pole) of the inclosure, but it was not shown that the defendant Was previously aware, or should have been, of the presence of this bird’s nest. However, the complaint is not made that the bird’s nest was an attractive nuisance. It would require - an unusual degree of care to prevent boys from climbing trees and posts in search of birds’ nests.</p>

A number of witnesses testified on behalf of defendant to the effect that there were footprints on the posts and braces. The injured boy wore shoes. His companion was barefooted. A witness testified that he observed “one foot-print on the angle brace that came up at the side of the corner post, and this brace had showed the print of a foot where <a id="p689" href="#p689" data-label="689" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*689</a>some one had climbed np the brace to get on the inside of the substation. ’ <em>*</em>

There would even then have been no danger had not the injured boy, with the aid of the plank, after getting into the inclosure, climbed upon the transformer, where he could reach the wire. It is true this wire was not insulated, but why should it have been, if it was in a place where there was no reason to anticipate that it could be reached, even by a child?</p>

The annotations extend from page 34 to page 294, and this exhaustive review is summarized as follows: “To recapitulate: To make out a case against the person responsible for the danger, there must appear: First. That the injured child was too young to understand and avoid the danger. Second. That there was reason to anticipate the presence of such children, either because of some attraction on the premises, or because the danger was in some place where children had a right to be. Third. That there was a strong likelihood of accident. Fourth. That the danger was one other than those ordinarily encountered. Fifth.

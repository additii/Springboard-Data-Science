We must decide whether a desire to work only part time constitutes a good cause reason for leaving work, thus permitting an individual who leaves work for that reason to collect unemployment benefits. Darkenwald claims that her employer’s request that she increase her working hours to three days per week gave her good cause to leave work because she wanted to continue working only two days per week. She relies on a statute that does not apply to her and would not give her good cause to leave work even if it were applicable. The Employment Security Act (Act), Title 50 RCW, lists good-cause reasons for voluntarily leaving work and states that this list is exclusive. A desire to perform only part-time work is not a good cause under the Act, and the part-time worker provisions do not apply.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> For these reasons, we affirm.</p>

Initially, <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>Darkenwald worked one day a week, but she increased this to two days a week and then four days a week. In 1998, she suffered a neck and back injury. Darkenwald received worker’s compensation benefits after the Department of Labor and Industries found that she had a permanent impairment. Despite her injury, Darkenwald continued to work three to four days a week until 2006. From that point on, Darkenwald worked only on Mondays and Wednesdays, for a total of 14 to 17 hours per week. Dr. Yamaguchi asserts that Darkenwald reduced her hours in order to spend more time with her family.</p>
    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[205,968,1247,852]]]'>¶3 In 2010, Dr. Yamaguchi added another dentist to his practice. Dr. Yamaguchi met with Darkenwald and asked her to return to working three days a week; specifically, he asked her to work Fridays in addition to Mondays and Wednesdays. In the alternative, he offered her a position as an on-call or substitute hygienist.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Darkenwald found neither of these alternatives acceptable and thus interpreted Dr. Yamaguchi’s request as a termination of her employment, telling him, “I hear you saying that I am fired.” During this meeting, Darkenwald never said that her disability prevented her from working more than two days per week. Afterward, Darkenwald believed she had been fired, while Dr. Yamaguchi believed that she had quit. Darkenwald worked her last day at Dr. Yamaguchi’s office a few days after this meeting, declining his offer of continued employment for three more weeks.</p>

Her initial application for benefits listed “wanted me to work more days” as the reason she was fired. The application did not mention her disability. After reviewing Dr. Yamaguchi’s response, the Department denied Darken-wald’s claim, stating that she had not been discharged but rather had “quit for personal reasons” and had “not established good cause” for quitting.</p>
    <p id="b297-4" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[91,811,1255,704]]]'>¶5 Darkenwald appealed the denial of her claim to an administrative law judge (ALJ) with the Department. The ALJ- concluded that Darkenwald voluntarily quit her job as a part-time dental hygienist and failed to establish good cause for leaving work. In his decision, the ALJ wrote that Darkenwald had quit and had not been discharged and concluded that while she “had good personal reasons for quitting as she did not want to work more than two days a week,” she “has not established that her medical condition was the reason she was not able to work on Fridays.” The Department’s commissioner adopted the ALJ’s findings of fact and conclusions of law and upheld the ALJ’s decision on substantially the same grounds.</p>
    <p id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.5",297,[92,1541,1250,595]]]'>¶6 Darkenwald appealed to the Thurston County Superior Court, which reversed the commissioner’s decision and directed the Department to grant Darkenwald unemployment benefits. The Superior Court rejected the commissioner’s findings that Darkenwald had voluntarily quit and “that Darkenwald refused or was not interested in working on Fridays.” Instead, the Superior Court concluded that Darkenwald’s disability prevented her from working more than two days a week and that Dr. Yamaguchi’s request for Darkenwald to work three days a week made him “the moving or initiating party leading to Darkenwald’s termination.”</p>

Our determination of this issue turns on how we construe two statutes: RCW 50.20.050(2)(a), which enumerates what circumstances constitute “good cause” for voluntarily leaving work, and RCW 50.20.119, which permits a “part-time worker” to refuse full-time employment and still receive benefits.</p>

The legislative history demonstrates that the legislature rejected reading such additional causes into the list.

      <em>Id. </em>at 17 (first alteration in original). The telephone number identified in these requests is connected to Lindquist’s private cell phone. There is no dispute that Lindquist personally bought the phone, personally pays for its monthly service, and sometimes uses it in the course of his job.</p>
    <p id="b924-7" data-blocks='[["BL_924.5",924,[196,858,1249,531]]]'>¶3 In response to these requests, Lindquist obtained and provided the County with two types of records. The first, which the parties refer to as the “call log,” is similar to an itemized statement customers might receive from their service provider each month. It contains information about the dates and times of calls made and received, the length of those calls, and the phone number of the incoming or outgoing call. Lindquist’s service provider, Verizon Wireless, generated the call log and provided it to Lindquist at his request. He voluntarily produced it to the County.</p>
    <p id="b924-8" data-blocks='[["BL_924.6",924,[198,1409,1248,476]]]'>¶4 The second type of record reveals information about text messages Lindquist sent and received over two days (“text message log”). The text message log does not reveal the content of those messages. Instead, similar to the call log, it itemizes the date and time of each message and provides the telephone number of the corresponding party. Lindquist also obtained the text message log from Verizon after receiving Nissen’s PRA requests and produced it to the County.</p>

Accompanied by an exemption log, the redactiohs conceal line items for calls and text messages that Lindquist self-described as personal in nature. The remaining unredacted portions relate to calls and text messages that the County and <a id="p871" href="#p871" data-label="871" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*871</a>Lindquist admit might be work related. <em>See </em>CP at 490 (Decl. of Mark Lindquist in Supp. of Mot.

Thus nearly half of the text messages Lindquist sent or received and many of his phone calls during the relevant period potentially related to his job as the elected prosecutor. The County did not produce the contents of any text message, however, though copies of them exist on Verizon’s servers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">3</a>

    <p id="b925-4" data-blocks='[["BL_925.4",925,[79,1087,1255,797]]]'>¶6 Dissatisfied with the County’s disclosures, Nissen sued the County in Thurston County Superior Court. She sought an in camera review of Lindquist’s text messages and the call and text message logs to determine if all of the information is a public record. Lindquist intervened and moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to enjoin further disclosure of records related to his cell phone. He argued that compelling him to disclose his text messages would violate the state and federal constitutions and was prohibited by state and federal statutes. CP at 502-18. That same day, the County moved to dismiss Nissen’s complaint under CR 12(b)(6). It argued the records at issue could not be public records as a matter of law, because they related to a personal cell phone rather than a county-issued one.</p>

It does not involve a records request for every piece of data on a smartphone. And it does not involve a citizen suing a public employee for access to the employee’s phone. Instead, this is an action against an agency for two types of records that, while potentially related to the agency’s public business, are in the exclusive control of the agency’s employee.

We then apply that definition to the specific records here — the call and text message logs and text messages. Finally, we address the mechanics of searching for and obtaining public records held by or in the control of public employees. As explained below, we hold that text messages sent or received by Lindquist in his official capacity can be public records of the County, regardless of the public or private nature of the device used to create them; and we order Lindquist to obtain, segregate, and produce those public records to the County.</p>

The County is correct that every agency the PRA identifies is a political body arising under law (e.g., a county). But those bodies lack an innate ability to prepare, own, use, or retain any record. They instead act exclusively through their employees and other agents, and when an employee acts within the scope of his or her employment, the employee’s actions are tantamount to “the actions of the [body] itself.” <em>Houser v.

If the PRA did not capture records individual employees prepare, own, use, or retain in the course of their jobs, the public would be without information about much of the daily operation of government.

To the contrary, the PRA is explicit that information qualifies as a public record “regardless of [its] physical form or characteristics.” RCW 42.56.010(3). In <em>O’Neill, </em>we held that a city official stored a public record on a private computer in her home by using the computer for city business, 170 Wn.2d at 150, which is consistent with the idea that employees can use their own property and still be within the scope of their employment. <em>Dickinson v.

This limits the reach of the PRA to records related to the employee’s public responsibilities. For instance, employees do not generally act within the scope of employment when they text their spouse about working late or discuss their job on social media. Nor do they typically act within the scope of employment by creating or keeping records purely for private use, like a diary.

Nissen sufficiently alleges that Lindquist sent and received text messages in his official capacity “to take actions retaliating against her and other official misconduct.” CP at 14.

Without one, the PRA cannot fulfill the people’s mandate to have “full access to information concerning the conduct of government on every level.” Laws of 1973, ch. 1, § 1(11). As noted earlier, many counties, cities, and agencies around the state recognize the need to capture and retain public records created on personal devices. Some of those entities provide employees with a way to preserve public records and avoid any inquiry into their private affairs by, for example, syncing work-related documents, e-mails, and text messages to an agency server or other place accessible to the employer. The County apparently has no such policy.</p>

If it were, the effectiveness of the PRA would hinge on “the whim of the public officials whose activities it is designed to regulate.” <em>Mead Sch. Dist. No. 354 v. Mead Educ.

The legislature tasks us with interpreting the PRA liberally and in light of the people’s insistence that they have information about the workings of the government they created. RCW 42.56.030. Of course, the public’s statutory right to public records does not extinguish an individual’s constitutional rights in private information. But we do not read the PRA as a zero-sum choice between personal liberty and government accountability. Instead, we turn to well-settled principles of public disclosure law and hold that an employ<a id="p885" href="#p885" data-label="885" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*885</a>ee’s good-faith search for public records on his or her personal device can satisfy an agency’s obligations under the PRA.</p>
    <p id="b939-4" data-blocks='[["BL_939.4",939,[75,505,1258,1140]]]'>¶38 Though technology evolves, segregating public records from nonpublic ones is nothing new for agencies responding to a PRA request. Whether stored in a file cabinet or a cell phone, the PRA has never authorized “unbridled searches” of every piece of information held by an agency or its employees to find records the citizen believes are responsive to a request. <em>Hangartner v.

The onus is instead on the agency — necessarily through its employees — to perform “an adequate search” for the records requested. <em>Neigh. All., </em>172 Wn.2d at 720-21. To satisfy the agency’s burden to show it conducted an adequate search for records, we permit employees in good faith to submit “reasonably detailed, nonconclusory affidavits” attesting to the nature and extent of their search. <em>Id. </em>at 721. The PRA allows a trial court to resolve disputes about the nature of a record “based solely on affidavits,” RCW 42.56.550(3), without an in camera review, without searching for records itself, and without infringing on an individual’s constitutional privacy interest in private information he or she keeps at work.</p>

Employees must produce any public records (e-mails, text messages, and any other type of data) to the employer agency.

Certainly, the same can be said of any search for public records, not just for records related to employee cell phone use. But we offer two specific responses. First, an employee’s judgment would often be required to help identify public records on a cell phone, even in an in camera review. Text messages, for example, are short communications whose meaning may not be self-apparent. Unlike a chain of e-mails where the preceding messages are often replicated in the body of each new reply, text messages may contain only a few words. The employee then might be needed to put that message into context to determine if it meets the statutory definition of a “public record.”</p>

The people enacted the PRA “mindful of the right of individuals to privacy,” Laws of 1973, ch. 1, § 1(11), and individuals do not sacrifice all constitutional protection by accepting public employment. <em>City of Ontario v.

E-mails can be routed through agency servers, documents can be cached to agency-controlled cloud services, and instant messaging apps can store conversations. Agencies could provide employees with an agency-issued device that the agency retains a right to access, or they could prohibit the use of personal devices altogether. That these may be more effective ways to address employee cell phone use, however, does not diminish the PRA’s directive that we liberally construe it here to promote access to all public records.

Records that an agency employee prepares, owns, uses, or retains on a private cell phone within the scope of employment can be “public records” of the agency under RCW 42.56.010(3). Nissen’s complaint thus sufficiently alleges that at least some of the text messages at issue may be public records subject to disclosure. Because it is impossible at this stage to determine if any messages are in fact public records, on remand, the parties are directed as follows. Lindquist must obtain a transcript of the content of all the text messages at issue, review them, and produce to the County any that are public records consistent with our opinion. The County must then review those messages — -just as it would any other public record — and apply any applicable exemptions, redact information if necessary, and produce the records and any exemption log to Nissen. As to text messages that Lindquist in good faith determines are not public records, he must submit an affidavit to the County attesting to the personal character of those messages.

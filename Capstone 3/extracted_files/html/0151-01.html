Generally, those alleging that their neighbors’ activities are a nuisance must prove that the activities are, on balance, unreasonable and cause some inconvenience, discomfort, or interference. When, however, an activity is a nuisance per se, plaintiffs need not show that the activity is also unreasonable. Here, the plaintiffs sued their neighbors, arguing, among other things, that the noise, smoke, fumes, and traffic associated with a small motor repair shop was in effect a nuisance in fact and that their neighbors are subject to nuisance per se liability because the business lacked required permits. The trial judge entered detailed findings of fact on the plaintiffs’ nuisance in fact claims; found that the alleged noise, smoke, fumes, and traffic related to the business did not injure the plaintiffs’ property, unreasonably detract from the plaintiffs’ enjoyment of their property, or cause cognizable damages; and dismissed the case. The Court of Appeals reversed in part, concluding the trial court erred by not deciding whether the business was required to obtain any more permits. Finding that the plaintiffs did not establish that the business is a nuisance per se, we reinstate the trial court’s judgment.</p>

One of the neighbors, Steven Love, lives on the upland side of the highway. He has been repairing boat motors on his property, at least occasionally, since he moved there around 1986. In 1994, Love left his old employer and established his own outboard motor maintenance and repair operation, called Steve’s Outboard Service (SOS), out of his home and several outbuildings on his property. That same year, he filed a Shoreline Management Act of 1971 (SMA), ch. 90.58 RCW, permit application proposing to build a 30' by 45' metal building on his property for his business. After some of his neighbors expressed concerns, he withdrew the application and instead successfully applied for a building permit to replace his carport with an attached garage.</p>

It appears the Moores became unhappy with the noise, exhaust, and traffic associated with SOS<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and, by 2003, began investigating ways to have it stopped. After many unsuccessful complaints to various government agencies, the Moores sued Steven and Mary Lou Love, SOS, and Mason County (collectively the Loves) on a variety of grounds, including nuisance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> During a two day bench trial, both sides presented witnesses and evidence, largely on whether SOS’s work created noise, fumes, or dangerous traffic conditions. Only a small part of the evidence presented went to whether the Loves were operating without a required permit. Most relevantly, Stephen Love testified that while many government agencies had inspected his business in <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>response to complaints, many that were anonymous, no government agency had ever told him he was operating in violation of the law or without a required permit. After trial, Judge Sheldon found for the defense. Among other things, the trial judge found that even if the business was “in violation of the SMA, other Mason County or Washington State regulations or permits,” the plaintiffs had not proved any damages and were not entitled to relief. Clerk’s Papers at 242. The trial judge did not reach whether the Loves actually violated any laws in operating their business or failing to obtain any permits. Nor did the trial judge enter a finding that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the Loves violated any laws or failed to obtain any required permits, though the scant evidence presented to the trial judge by the plaintiffs supported such a finding.</p>

    <p id="b190-6" data-blocks='[["BL_190.7",190,[204,1878,1250,469]]]'>¶5 Essentially, the Moores argue that using land without a required permit necessarily transforms the land use into a nuisance per se and is actionable in a private nuisance suit so long as the land use interferes with the use and enjoyment of the plaintiffs’ land. We hold that the failure to obtain a permit does not transform a use of land into a nuisance per se unless the legislature has specifically so declared or the courts of this state have specifically so found.

Since it was lawful to sell cars on other days, “the acts complained of are not acts which constitute a nuisance at all times and under all conditions, thus failing <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>of one of the most important elements of a nuisance <em>per se.” Id. </em>The plaintiffs have not shown that the failure to obtain a permit is a nuisance at all times and under all conditions.

Boren had been enjoined by the King County Superior Court from practicing dentistry without a license. <em>Id. </em>at 155-56. Observing that “[e]ngaging in any business or profession in defiance of law regulating or prohibiting the same is a nuisance <em>per se, </em>and a person so engaged may be enjoined from so doing, even though there may be, for the wrong committed, the legal remedy of arrest and punishment,” we dismissed his collateral challenge to the injunction as without merit. <em>Id. </em>at 163 (citing <em>Puget Sound Traction Light &amp; Power Co. v. Grassmeyer, </em><a href="/wash/102/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="102 Wash. 482" data-case-ids="670227" data-case-paths="/wash/102/0482-01">102 Wash. 482</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20P.%20504" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="173 P. 504">173 P. 504</a> (1918)). Certainly, practicing one of the learned professions without a license could be a nuisance per se. <em>E.g., Boren, </em>42 Wn.2d at 163. Those practicing in the learned professions, such as law, medicine, and dentistry, have special capacity to harm those entrusted into their care. <em>See State v.

Thus, in those special cases, the failure to obtain a license (or permit) could potentially be the basis of a viable nuisance per se claim. But whether it is a nuisance to practice dentistry without being licensed under the laws put in place to protect the public is a very different question from whether it is a nuisance to repair motors without an SMA permit.</p>

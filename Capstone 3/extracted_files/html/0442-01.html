We there held, after reciting the provisions of § 3738, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, in regard to assessment of persons whose names had been omitted from the original assessment rolls, that this method of issuing poll tax receipts did not conform to the requirements of the law, and did not qualify the holders of such receipts to vote. In so deciding, we cited both the CarlLee and the Craig cases, <em>supra, </em>as having held that the collector can issue a valid poll tax receipt only to a person whose name has been placed upon the tax book in the manner provided by law.</p>

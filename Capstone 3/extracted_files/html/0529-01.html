Plans were formed for the construction of the improvement, and assessments of benefits to the lands in the district were'made, but, in litigation which arose between the district and certain landowners, before further progress had been made in the affairs of the district, it was decided that the plans exceeded in scope the authority conferred by the statute creating the district. <em>Cypress Creek Drainage District </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em><a href="/ark/109/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="109 Ark. 60" data-case-ids="1341240" data-case-paths="/ark/109/0060-01">109 Ark. 60</a>.

Such is the form of the provision in article 5 of the Constitution of the United States. In some of the decisions on this subject it has been held that constitutional provisions guaranteeing compensation merely for the taking of property only include damages for injuries resulting from an invasion or destruction of the property, and not merely an incidental injury; but decisions of other courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em><a href="/citations/?q=188%20U.S.%20446" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="188 U.S. 446">188 U.

In the first place, it may be said that there is a conflict in the testimony, and a finding of fact against them by the trial court, which is binding upon this court on appeal. The trial court found from the evidence that the damage to the lands of the plaintiffs was actually considered, by the assessors in making the assessment of benefits. In addition to that, we are of the opinion that, according to the undisputed evidence,' the property was not actually taken and used by the district in the operation of the project so as to separate it from the other lands of the plaintiffs and prevent the damage being balanced off against the benefits. The only portions of the land taken for the purpose of constructing the improvement were the lands covered by the drainage ditch. The waters were gathered up and thrown into Bayou Macon, but the incidental injury to lands abutting on Bayou Macon did not constitute a taking of those lands, though it resulted in injury for <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>which compensation must be made within the meaning of the Constitution. The lands were frequently overflowed, but they remain the property of the plaintiffs for the enjoyment of such limited use to which they were susceptible in the damaged condition. Suffering the damages thus inflicted did not 'constitute a contribution of private property to public use in the sense that that portion of the land was separated from the remainder so as to prevent the balancing off of said damage against benefits to the whole of the lands. We think that the facts of the case bring it within the rule announced in <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Sanders, <a href="/ark/149/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="149 Ark. 15" data-case-ids="8717508" data-case-paths="/ark/149/0015-01">supra,</a> </em>and that the assessment of benefits, including the estimate of damages, was conclusive of the rights of plaintiffs to recover compensation.

The completion of the plans---the completion of this clearing down Bayou Macon will nive us relief down Bayou Macon, but of course from the point above ditch No. 13 we will still have higher water than we planned. Q. And that is due to the water that the Kirsch Lake District has turned into Cypress Creek? A. Yes sir, and the failure to cut ditch No. 13.”</blockquote>

Do you know when the water from Kirsch Lake Drainage District was diverted into Bayou Macon? A. In a general way. I wasn’t here at the time. I was here in 1917, or the early part of 1918. Q. The original plans of the Cypress Creek District did not contemplate taking care of any of the water which the Kirsch Lake District dumped into the Cypress Creek Drainage District, did it? A. Not at that point. They contemplated taking care of that water down below- the point where this land is located. It would have finally come into Bayou Macon. Q. But it would have come into Bayou Macon, had the original plans of the Kirsch Lake District been carried out, below the location of the lands in suit? A. Yes sir. Q. But the act of Kirsch Lake Drainage District in dumping their water into Cypress Creek at a different place affected -the lands in suit? A. Yes sir, it resulted in throwing more water into the ditch where these lands are located. Q. That is what I mean? A. Yes sir. Q. It raised the flood level on this'land by nutting additional water on them? A. Yes -sir. Q. Mr. Miller, do you know whether or not the plans for the Kirsch Lake Drainage District called "for a discharge ditch at a place that would carry this water into Bayou <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>Macon below the lands in the suit — the original plans called for that? A. I don’t recall very well about that. The Cypress Creek Drainage District plans were, made so as to take care of the Kirsch Lake water at the lower end of that district. Q. The point I am asking is this: Didn’t the plans of the Kirsch Lake District also call for a ditch, in conjunction with the plans of the Cypress Creek Drainage District, to take care of the water you have mentioned? A. I think so. I am not sure. Q. But the Kirsch Lake District afterwards dug an additional ditch not called for in the plans at all? A. Yes sir, I know that. Q. And this threw the water of the Kirsch Lake District on the lands in suit, where it wouldn’t have done that if they had followed the plans of the district? A. Yes sir, that is a fact.”</blockquote>

If Kirsch Lake District had drained down ditch No. 43, as contemplated, would the lands in suit have received as much water as they do? A. Kirsch Lake District wasn’t ever contemplated to go down ditch 43. It was originally planned to go down Bayou Bartholomew to ditch 13. Q. That is what I mean? A. Yes sir. Well, it was a part of the original plans of Cypress Creek to dig number 13, but 13 was abandoned, then the Kirsch Lake District changed their plans, and, instead of turning their water into Bayou Bartholomew, they diverted it into ditch number 19 at the north of the Desha County line. That put an additional amount of water into Bayou Macon? A. It turned the water they' had planned from Kirsch Lake District to go into No. 13, but when No. 13 was abandoned they turned it in, about fifteen miles higher up, into Cypress Creek Drainage District, and thereby increased the volume of water in' the upper waters of Bayou Macon.

It was known from the beginning that •the Kirsch Lake Drainage District was being formed and that the water from it must flow into some of the ditches or bayous of the Cypress Creek Drainage District. The Kirsch Lake Drainage District was adjacent to the Cypress Creek Drainage District, and northwest from it. The waters from the ditches in the territory comprising it flowed in a general southeasterly direction, and would necessarily flow into the territory of the Cypress Creek Drainage District.</p>

The assessments of benefits theretofore made was thereupon confirmed, including those as to which the collection of taxes had been enjoined. No attempt was made to construct canal No. 13 under the provisions of this act. Hence it became necessary for the commissioners of the Kirsch Lake Drainage District to find-another outlet for the waters flowing from that district. This was done by digging a canal in a generally eastern direction, so that the waters would flow into canal No. 19, which was the main canal in the plans of the Cypress Creek Drainage District, above the lands of the plaintiffs, and thereby caused them to overflow, as testified to by the witnesses for the plaintiffs and also by the engineers for the defendant, as shown by their testimony as copied above.</p>

Therefore, instead of benefiting the lands of the plaintiffs, the construction of the drainage system caused their lands to be greatly damaged.</p>

As we have already seen, it was evidently done after the passage of the act in 1915 amending the act under which the drainage system, was originally planned. If so, then the damage caused by the change of the plans could not have been considered by the commissioners in making the original assessments or by the Legislature in 1915 in confirming the same. It necessarily follows that the damage was caused to the plaintiffs’ lands by a change of plans made after the act of • February 25, .1915, was passed; the case falls squarely within the principles of law decided in <em>Road District No. 6 </em>v. <em>Hall, </em><a href="/ark/140/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="140 Ark. 241" data-case-ids="1594459" data-case-paths="/ark/140/0241-01">140 Ark. 241</a>.</p>

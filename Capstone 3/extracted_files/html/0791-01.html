D. Donnahoe and his -son, F. C., relative to the notes in question, and, when he ascertained that the insurance company was <em>going </em>to foreclose its mortgage, he asked Donnahoe about it, and he told him it was a fact.

In fact, I have already paid you three years in advance, given you cash for three years, and you got the notes for the fourth and fifth years. If you are going to be foreclosed, I think you will agree that it would be nothing but right to give me these notes. And he, Forrest, said that was all right, they would fix that up all right. Then I got hold of the old man and we talked about it, and he said, ‘I do not want to give those notes up right now, but do not worry about the notes, because you have already paid uis the cash, and if they foreclose you will lose two years, and you need not worry about the notes; if they foreclose we will not worry you about the notes.’ I asked him if they had the notes, and he said, ‘Yes, we have them, they are all right; you need not worry about the notes.’ I went back to them the second and third time, and talked to both of them the last time, and never got the notes, but they admitted they had the notes lat that time, and I did not file this suit until after they told me they had the notes and refused to give them back to me.” Said the timber contract and the lease were entirely, separate matters, neither dependent upon the other, and that Donnahoe, after showing him a letter from the mortgagee insurance company relative to the lease, said he would take the money paid by him, $1,§20 cash, and pay it on the interest and loan due.</p>

That Davis, his partner, never had anything to do with any of the negotiations. Stated his conversations about the contract were with Donnahoe and his son, sometimes with each and sometimes with both. That, after the foreclosure of the mortgage, he leased the lands from the Missouri State Life Insurance .Company, which purchased them under the sale, and paid them the same amount of rent yearly that he 'had agreed to pay Donnahoe. .</p>

Said he showed the insurance company’s letter to Wallin, and told him that there was a way they could fix this, and to go see a lawyer and make a contract, and he did that. He employed W. B.. Scott. Said he regarded the two papers as one contract, and they called for some notes, which he had delivered to Blair some time the latter part of July, 1924. That he had had a conversation with Wallin shortly after he made the contract, and told him that he might have to use the two notes, and he replied “All right, my notes are good.” Said the timber contract had nothing to do with the lease contract. That he read them over and signed both, and did not know of any misunderstanding. “I saw Mr. Blair before making- the contract. * * * He advised me about the contract. * * # I suppose he knew at the time I traded him the notes that they were the anotes Wallin gave on the lease. * * * The consideration Mr. Blair paid' for the notes was that he had been attending to my business for a long time. We bad had no settlement, and he was pushing me and wanted a settlement, and I told him I was not able to pay anything, and was a sick man, and he said he could take the notes and wait longer, and that was how we traded. I do not know if Mr. Blair has ever rendered me any statement. Probably he has mentioned some debts that have been running along that I owed him.” Witness could not remember the amount of any particular service charged for nor any particular service rendered, nor how much he had ever paid Blair, his attorney, nor that he had ever been furnished a statement of the charges by Mr. Blair.</p>

His father said he wanted to get a contract that would take care of him and the company, and that, if he should fail, Luther Wallin would back the proposition up. The timber and the lease contract was one trade. “Mr. Wallin had the contracts drawn by W. B. Scott. It was one entire contract that was made for the timber and another for the lease and right-of-way.” Told Mr. Wallin that Blair had advised they had no right to sell the timber or lease the right-of-way.

Admitted signing'the contracts in the name of his father. Said there were two notes signed, which they traded to Mr. Blair between the first and tenth of July, 1924. He had heard a conversation in which his father told Mr. Wallin that they might have to use the notes. Said he transferred the notes to Mr. Blair because they awed him $500 for attending to his father’s business, and- he was pushing them. Blair had been attending to his father’s business ten or twelve years, and “had never paid him anything-, except $'25 at one time.

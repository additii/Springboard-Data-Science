He is only arguing the point you raised.” This action of the court and the reason given is sought to be justified by the rule announced in <em>Collins </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/143/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="143 Ark. 604" data-case-ids="1589359" data-case-paths="/ark/143/0604-01">143 Ark. 604</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=221%20S.W.%20455" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="221 S.W. 455">221 S. W. 455</a>, on the theory that in this case, as in that, the error had been invited by appellant’s counsel. In <em>Collins </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>in announcing its conclusion, the court said: “But it appears from the record that the objection to this remark was overruled because counsel for defendant had stated that appellant had not taken the stand, for the reason that it was not necessary for him to do so, the inference being that there was nothing for appellant to deny; and to that statement the prosecuting attorney replied that appellant could have taken the stand and denied selling the stuff. This is a case of invited error. Appellant’s counsel should not <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>have commented upon appellant’s failure to take the stand. He should have based his argument upon the testimony which went to the jury without commenting upon the fact that appellant had not testified at all. The statute is a shield, and not a sword. It gives the defendant the right to testify at his election, and provides that his failure to make such request shall not create any presumption against him. But it does not give his counsel the right to discuss the failure to make this request and to furnish explanations concerning it.”</p>
    <p id="b153-3" data-blocks='[["BL_153.4",153,[149,847,1203,1119]]]'>It was on the testimony of Carl Mortenson, the admitted thief, that the State chiefly relied to establish the charge that .the animal stolen was in defendant’s possession with the guilty knowledge of the commission of the larceny. Several persons had testified as to the repeated statements of this witness that defendant knew nothing about his having stolen the animal. In commenting on the action of Mortenson and the testimony of these witnesses, appellant’s counsel in his argument to the jury, said: “What was Mortenson’s story of this affair all the way through up to the time and sometime after he was placed in jail? He said that Perry did not know anything about it. He told Jim Efurd that Perry did not know anything’ about it. He told Jess Wilson in Perry’s presence that Perry did not know anything about it. Perry told Jess Wilson, in Mortenson’s presence, that he, Perry, did not know anything about it. About what? About the heifer having been stolen, of course. We say that Perry did not know anything about it, about the heifer having been stolen, and when you hear from Perry again he will still be saying that he did not know anything about it.”</p>

To sustain this position, we are referred to the cases of <em>Ingram </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/110/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="110 Ark. 538" data-case-ids="1337149" data-case-paths="/ark/110/0538-01">110 Ark. 538</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20S.W.%2066" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="162 S.W. 66">162 S.

W. 506</a>. In our opinion, these cases do not support the contention made. In the first case the court noticed that in <em>Tiner </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/110/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="110 Ark. 251" data-case-ids="1337084" data-case-paths="/ark/110/0251-01">110 Ark. 251</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20S.W.%20195" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="161 S.W. 195">161 S. W. 195</a>, any opinion was withheld as to whether comment by the prosecuting attorney would be reversible error where the court directed the jury to disregard it. The court then proceeded to notice the contrariety of view of the courts on this question and the tendency of the more modern or recent cases to hold that, where such reference has been made and is withdrawn and corrected by the charge of the court, it do.es not constitute reversible error. In adopting that view, this court held in the case then before it that, when attention of the court was called to comment by the prosecuting attorney of defendant’s failure to testify, and he reminded the jury that they had been instructed not to consider that fact and emphasized again its duty in that respect, this served to cure the error. In <em>Starnes </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>the court approved and followed the rule laid down in the Ingram case. In that case, when the prosecuting attorney violated the rule the court im<a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>mediately instructed the jury as to their duty, charging them not to consider the failure of the defendant to testify or draw any unfavorable inferences against him on that account. In the instant case, the court, while having first instructed the jury on the failure of the defendant to testify and define their duty in that regard, subsequently approved the argument of the prosecuting attorney which appellant construed as a comment on his failure to testify, thus nullifying the force of the charge which had before been given.</p>
    <p id="b155-5" data-blocks='[["BL_155.4",155,[140,861,1201,403]]]'>Because of the statute, we must presume that prejudice resulted when not removed by prompt action of the court. As said in <em>Bridgeman </em>v. <em>State, supra: </em>“The Legislature has seen fit to pass the statute in question, and there seems to be no discretion with the court in passing upon the probable injury of such allusion. This being true, we have no alternative except to reverse the judgment.”</p>
    <p id="b155-6" data-blocks='[["BL_155.5",155,[139,1270,1201,251]]]'>Because the judgment must be reversed, it becomes unnecessary to notice the other alleged errors as they are not likely to occur again, and, since there must be a retrial of this case, we refrain from commenting on the weight and sufficiency of the evidence.</p>

Despite this race-based staffing directive, the trial court entered a verdict for the State and dismissed Employees’ employment discrimination claims.

Employees all worked on the evening/swing shift on the same ward (ward F-5) of the Center for Forensic Services at WSH. Employee Patricia Blackburn, a registered nurse (RN), worked as the charge nurse on ward F-5. Her race is Caucasian.

He was often delusional as a result of failing to take his medications and had spent significant time in seclusion and restraints. M.P. had a history of methamphetamine abuse, and he suffered from schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. M.P. was housed on ward F-8.</p>

The trial court found that “the decision was made that [M.P.] should not have access to African[-]American staff” and Yates directed that a “white staff person needed to go to F-8,” instead of the African-American staff who were next on the pull list. CP at 2710 (FOF 7, 9). These overt race-based directives affected staffing decisions in such a manner as to constitute discrimination in “terms or conditions of employment because of. . . race” in violation of RCW 49.60.180(3). We hold that the trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>

RCW 49.60.180 allows employers to take protected characteristics into account in limited circumstances. <em>See </em>RCW 49.60.180(1) (prohibition against discrimination in hiring does not apply if based on a BFOQ), (3) (permitting segregated washrooms and locker <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>facilities on the basis of sex and allowing the Washington State Human Rights Commission to issue regulations or rulings “for the practical realization of equality of opportunity between the sexes”), (4) (prohibition against discrimination in advertising, job applications, and preemployment inquiries does not apply if based on a BFOQ). In order to satisfy the BFOQ standard, the employer must prove (1) that the protected characteristic is essential to job purposes or (2) that all or substantially all persons with the disqualifying characteristic would be unable to efficiently perform the job. <em>Hegwine, </em>162 Wn.2d at 358.</p>
    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.4",298,[202,965,1247,473]]]'>¶20 None of these statutory exceptions apply. RCW 49.60.180(3) allows limited exceptions for classifications only based on sex, not race. And even if the BFOQ defense from RCW 49.60.180(1) or (4) could apply in this case, which is doubtful, the State waived it. CP at 2641; 1 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Feb. 2, 2015) at 11. The State fails to assert any other defense that our statutes or case law recognize. Therefore, Employees prevail on their disparate treatment claims.</p>

RCW 49.60.180(3) prohibits harassment based on a protected characteristic that rises to the level of a hostile work environment. An employee must demonstrate four elements for a hostile work environment claim: that the harassment (1) was unwelcome, (2) was because of a protected characteristic, (3) affected the terms or conditions of employment, and (4) is imputable to the employer. <em>Glasgow v.

RCW 49.60.030(2) allows successful plaintiffs in WLAD actions to recover damages, injunctive relief, costs, and attorney fees. Because we find that Employees have prevailed on their disparate treatment claim and have complied with RAP 18.1 and RCW 49.60.030(2), we remand this case to the trial court to determine the appropriate damages and reasonable attorney fees to award in this case. On remand, the trial court should also consider whether injunctive relief is appropriate and, if so, the trial court will be responsible for crafting the scope of and enforcing any injunction issued.</p>

      <a id="p697" href="#p697" data-label="697" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*697</a>It is undisputed that appellant rented about one hundred and sixty acres of land to Spellman for one-fourth of the cotton and seed raised during the year 1924, and furnished certain money and supplies to him during the period to enable him to farm _the lands, and that Spellman was indebted to appellant for a balance due thereon of $800 and interest when this suit was commenced. Appellant also took a chattel mortgage, which was duly recorded, on certain other personal property of Spellman, for all crops grown on the land rented for the year 1924, to secure payment for advances made.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b715-5" data-blocks='[["BL_715.5",715,[143,970,1204,557]]]'>About April 15 defendant, A. Wells, subleased a part of the land from the defendant, J. L. Spellman, appellant’s tenant, upon which he raised nine bales of cotton, which he sold to the other defendants, Topf &amp; Ivy, for $1,203, and the defendant, A. Wells, paid the plaintiff $301, which is one-fourth of the amount received for the cotton as rent for the land rented from Spellman, appellant’s tenant. Topf &amp; Ivy had no actual knowledge of the mortgage on the crop executed by Spellman, and no knowledge of any claim or lien of appellant on the cotton purchased by them.</p>

Appellant furnished no supplies to A. Wells, the subtenant, for the land on which the cotton in controversy was raised.</p>

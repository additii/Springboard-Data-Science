She argues that the State failed to prove two prerequisites to termination, one statutory and one constitutional. The statutory prerequisite is codified at RCW 13.34.180(1)(d); it requires the State to prove that it has offered and provided “all necessary services, reasonably available, capable of correcting the parental deficiencies within the foreseeable future.” The constitutional prerequisite is a finding (express or implied) of parental unfitness. We agree with H.O. that the State failed to prove the first prerequisite by the necessary evidentiary standard (clear, cogent, and convincing evidence). We there<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>fore reverse the Court of Appeals and reverse the order terminating H.O.’s parental rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b334-5" data-blocks='[["BL_334.5",334,[201,615,1248,800]]]'>¶2 The mother in this case, H.O., suffered from drug addiction, depression and other mental health issues, and the effects of long term childhood trauma. The child in this case, B.P., suffered as well: she was born addicted to methamphetamine, endured withdrawal, was abandoned by H.O. during infancy, and experienced multiple disruptions when forming attachments with H.O. and various foster parents. On the other hand, after several tries, H.O. achieved sobriety; benefited from treatment in a structured environment; and became an attentive and caring mother to another child, A., in that structured environment. She also engaged in partially supervised, therapeutic visitation with B.P, and the two began to form what witnesses at the termination hearing called a social relationship with an emerging emotional attachment.</p>
    <p id="b334-6" data-blocks='[["BL_334.6",334,[202,1440,1247,637]]]'>¶3 The significance of this attachment is the central disputed issue in this case. H.O. maintains that B.P. would have formed a stronger attachment to her if the Department of Social and Health Services (Department) had fulfilled its duty to provide “necessary services,” RCW 13.34.180(1)(d), to facilitate reunification. (It is undisputed that the Department provided B.P.’s foster parents with attachment therapy services.) The Department argues that it fulfilled this obligation but the services were futile. It maintains that the absence of a stronger attachment bond and H.O.’s risk of relapse now make her unfit to parent B.P. The trial court agreed with the Department.</p>
    <p id="b334-7" data-blocks='[["BL_334.7",334,[201,2102,1246,97]],["BL_335.1",335,[202,345,1246,209]]]'>¶4 The trial court is certainly in the best position to weigh the evidence presented about H.O.’s fits and starts, <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>B.P.’s needs, and the Department’s attempts to fulfill its responsibilities. And if those were the only issues presented by the tragic facts of this case, we would certainly defer to the trial court’s judgment.</p>
    <p id="b335-4" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[203,579,1245,151]]]'>¶5 Our court, however, must resolve a legal question about the framework the trial court should use to make decisions in a parental rights termination hearing.</p>
    <p id="b335-5" data-blocks='[["BL_335.5",335,[201,755,1247,1232]]]'>¶6 As discussed above, the legislature mandated that the Department provide all “necessary services” to parents like H.O. to try to move toward the goal of family reunification. RCW 13.34.180(1)(d). The trial court may not terminate a parent’s rights unless it determines that the Department fulfilled that duty or that services would be futile. The legislature did not specify how to implement this mandate where, as here, the Department identifies a child’s special needs and provides the foster parents, but not the biological parent, with the tools to try to address those needs. But recent precedent from this court and the Court of Appeals has addressed that issue, and we reaffirm that precedent now: where a child has special needs (here, special attachment needs), and where, as here, those special needs are exacerbated by the State’s failure to timely provide necessary services to the biological parent, then the State has failed to prove this legislatively mandated prerequisite to termination (absent futility, which was not shown here).

Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 180. B.P. was released into foster care July 13, 2011. In August 2011, an order of dependency was entered for B.P. That order and subsequent review orders required H.O. to complete random urinalysis (UA) testing, mental health treatment, chemical dependency evaluation and treatment, hands-on parenting training, therapeutic visitation, and family therapy. H.O. participated in mental health counseling and parenting services, and, in September 2011, B.P. was placed with her at Isabella House, a six-month residential chemical dependency program. Isabella House is a highly structured program: residents follow a regular schedule of chores, group therapy, exercise, and educational classes. Isabella House provides child care while residents participate in these activities. Residents of Isabella House follow a curfew, must sign in and out when they leave the facility, and must get permission to visit with any outsiders. H.O. successfully completed treatment at Isabella House in January 2012 and moved into the organization’s “[t]ransition [h]ouse” located next door. CP at 182. The transition house required residents to submit to UAs, observe a curfew, and participate in outpatient treatment and self-help groups.</p>

H.O. was allowed visitation with B.P. immediately upon her removal, but H.O. frequently arrived high for visits or missed them altogether. The dependency court suspended visitation in October 2012 after H.O. missed 10 scheduled visits and B.P. began displaying aggression and disorganized behavior toward H.O. during the visits she did attend. The court ordered that visitation would not resume unless H.O. obtained another court order reinstating visits. In November 2012, B.P. was placed into her fourth and final foster home, with her paternal aunt and uncle. B.P. did well in this placement, but when there was a change in her routine she showed significant distress. She displayed “disorganized” <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>attachment behavior and was unable to regulate her emotions. 2 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (RP) at 161 (Feb. 11, 2014).</p>

The Department filed a petition to terminate H.O.’s parental rights to B.P. When she was eight months pregnant, however, in May 2013, H.O. returned to Isabella House. H.O. gave birth to A. in June 2013, and the Department agreed to an in-home dependency so that A. could remain with H.O. at Isabella House. H.O. remained sober through the time of trial in this case, and A. has never been removed from her care.</p>

In August 2013, H.O. and B.P. had a visit supervised by Lori Eastep, a family therapist. At that point, the termination trial was set for September 16, 2013. Eastep reported that the visit went well, but she found it “contraindicated to begin visitation if the Department is moving toward termination,” and recommended at that time that visitation continue only if the State did not intend to seek termination.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> 1 RP at 64 (Feb. 10, 2014).

She also explained that in order for B.P. to form an attachment to H.O., she would need to sever her attachment to her foster parents.

Then it pursued termination on the theory that B.P.’s attachment needs were so severe that H.O. could not possibly meet them in the foreseeable future, given her location on the path to full recovery from substance abuse and childhood trauma. If there were evidence that H.O. had not progressed in treatment as expected during the six months preceding trial, then the State’s actions might be reasonable. But H.O.’s only slipups were two technical violations: accepting a ride from B.P.’s foster father while still living at Isabella House (a violation she self-reported to her counselors) and failing to verify participation in two outside support meetings in the first month of transitional housing treatment (something she attributed to her confusion over the program’s definition of an eligible meeting). H.O. never failed a UA during treatment, and no treating professional testified that they had current concerns about her sobriety. H.O. was successfully participating in all of the mental health services the State provided. On this record, the State’s sudden about-face in January 2014 is fundamentally unfair.</p>

[H.O.] cannot claim that because [A.] is in her care, that she must be fit to parent. [B.PJ’s needs are different and her attachment issues are the result of her mother’s actions. [H.O.] has not demonstrated an ability to understand her own feelings, or those of [B.P.]. Thus, the Department has established that [H.O.] is currently unfit to parent.</blockquote>

Furthermore, our legislature has explicitly declared that “[w]hen the rights of basic nurture, physical and mental health, and safety of the child and the legal rights of the parents are in conflict, the rights and safety of the child should prevail.” <em>Id. </em>The majority ignores this mandate and fails to properly consider B.P.’s rights.</p>

However, [B.P.] can no longer wait for [H.O.] to remedy her parental deficiencies.” CP at 187. There is no question that H.O. was “dealt a difficult set of cards.” 3 VRP at 438. The progress that she has achieved thus far is commendable. However, although H.O. has started down the road to recovery, progress is rarely ever a straight path, and there is no question that H.O. has a difficult and long journey ahead of her. The sad reality is that H.O.’s progress comes too little, too late for B.P.</p>

What she asks for now is more time to remedy her parental deficiencies despite a demonstrated inability to do so. As the trial court observed, “Without termination, the child remains in the limbo of foster care indefinitely.” CP at 187. How much longer must B.P. remain there?</p>

We should not conflate the question of whether providing a service would be futile with whether the service could remedy a parental deficiency within the foreseeable future, as required by RCW 13.34.180(1)(d). The issue here is not whether it would be futile to provide H.O. with additional services. Rather, the issue is whether there is substantial support in the record for the trial court’s finding that any additional services would not remedy H.O.’s parental deficiencies within the foreseeable future, as determined from B.R’s point of view in accordance with our case law. <em>See Hall, </em>99 Wn.2d at 851. I conclude that the evidence presented at trial does support such a conclusion and the majority’s reweighing of the evidence is troubling.</p>

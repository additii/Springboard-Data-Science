That the assessment was duly levied against each of the defendants in this action, and notice thereof given to them as provided by law. That each defendant was at the time the holder and owner of stock in the bank of the par value of $200. That due demand had been made upon each of the defendants for the payment of their respective assessments, and each had failed and refused to pay any part thereof.</p>

That the proceedings in the chancery court were not instituted with a <em>bona fide </em>purpose of liquidating the bank, “but for the collusive purpose of enabling certain stockholders of Dermott State Bank to liquidate the assets of Bank of Dermott to the detriment of the defendant.” That defendant had had no. day in court and no opportunity to protect himself against unlawful and improper liquidation of the assets of the bank, and, if required to pay the assessment, would be deprived of his property without due process of law.</p>

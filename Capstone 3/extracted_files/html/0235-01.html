Two police officers were dispatched to the defendant’s residence to follow up on several 911 hang-up calls that had originated from the house. Upon speaking with him, the officers observed that the defendant was intoxicated but determined that no further action was needed. Shortly after ending the initial contact, the officers received information that there was an outstanding warrant for the defendant’s arrest. When the officers returned to carry out the arrest, the defendant became hostile and belligerent and resisted the officers’ attempts to place him in the patrol car. While the officers were in the process of forcibly subduing him until backup arrived, the defendant spit in both of the officers’ faces. He continued to spit at the officers even after a spit mask was placed over his head. Once the defendant was restrained, the officers were able to place him in the patrol car and take him to jail. The defendant was charged with two counts of third degree assault for spitting on the arresting officers.</p>

The only evidence that the defendant offered was expert testimony from Dr. Robert Julien, a pharmacologist specializing in the effect of drugs on brain function.

    <p id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[202,636,1252,649]]]'>¶6 Determining that impeachment was permissible in accordance with ER 806, the court granted the State’s motion to cross-examine Dr. Julien with the defendant’s prior convictions. The court advised counsel that a limiting instruction is typically given when “an expert was going to be relating material that was not admissible as substantive evidence . . . explaining to the jury the limited purposes under which this material can be offered.” Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (July 1, 2014) at 27. Consequently, the court decided to prohibit the prosecution from specifying the details of the convictions due to the “novel situation” of “indirect impeachment” that was presented. <em>Id. </em>at 28-29.</p>

The State initially agreed to the instruction, but changed its position after defense counsel expressly requested that no instruction be offered at all. The court agreed not to give the limiting instruction prior to Dr. Julien’s testimony.</p>
    <p id="b277-6" data-blocks='[["BL_277.6",277,[201,1769,1248,594]]]'>¶8 Dr. Julien testified that the defendant was in a state of alcohol-induced blackout that prevented him from forming the requisite legal intent to commit assault. His opinion was based on a phone interview conducted with the defendant and a review of the police and witness reports. During his testimony, Dr. Julien related the defendant’s out-of-court statements regarding the quantity of alcohol he had consumed. Based on the defendant’s self-report, Dr. Julien estimated that the defendant’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 0.4 percent at the time of the arrest, “enough to guarantee blackout.” <em>Id. </em>at 55.</p>

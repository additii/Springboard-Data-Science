It was there held that the act of 1917, authorizing the -borrowing of a certain sum of money to cover deficiencies in the State’s general revenue fund, to issue interest-bearing evidences of indebtedness therefor, and to levy a tax to create a sinking fund to pay the interest and principal of said note, was valid. After considering and defining the meaning of the provisions of the Constitution now under consideration, the court said:</p>

The general rule is that, unless specifically restricted by the Constitution, the construction of highways by a State is the exercise of a public function, and it has been held that they may be constructed and maintained, either by the State, or under its authority, by municipal subdivisions or taxing districts created by the Legislature for that purpose.

Under this act and amendment, the State Highway Commission was authorized to ascertain the amount and dates of the maturity of the principal of the valid unmatured bonds on January 1, 1924, which had been issued by each road improvement district in the State, and to allot and distribute to certain counties which had been classified the proportion in which the State highway fund allotted to them should be used in the payment réspectively of bonds and interest coupons.

In it the Legislature declared it to be the policy of the State to take over, construct, repair, maintain and control all the public roads in the State, comprising the State highway system as defined in the act. This act was challenged on the ground <a id="p1109" href="#p1109" data-label="1109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1109</a>that it was in violation of the provision of the Constitution copied above. The court expressly held, that the State might borrow money for the construction of the roads provided for in the act and issue State highway notes therefor, and that this did not violate the provision of the Constitution above referred to, to the effect that the State shall not loan its credit for any purpose. The court said that the State did not loan its credit, but only used it. The reason is that highways may be constructed and maintained for.public use by the State itself or by governmental agencies created by law for that purpose. Public highways are for public use, and there is no reason why the power of taxation by the State may not be exercised in their behalf. While it is elemental that taxes may only be levied for a public purpose, one of the most important duties of the State is to provide and construct public highways. <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Martineau, </em><a href="/ark/174/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="174 Ark. 214" data-case-ids="8719649" data-case-paths="/ark/174/0214-01">174 Ark. 214</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=295%20S.W.%209" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="295 S.W. 9">295 S.

In concluding the discussion, it was said that it has become recognized that the State, although prohibited from loaning its credit in the furtherance of public enterprises, may still use that credit for the promotion of the common good. Some of us dissented on the ground that the ■tax levied under the act was for a private purpose, and therefore unconstitutional, although it passed through the hands of public officers.

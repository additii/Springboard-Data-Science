It was alleged that payment had not been made, and judgment was prayed for the allowance of appellant’s claim against the bank as a preferred claim and for judgment against all.of the stockholders by reason of their guaranty.</p>

The court decreed that the defendants, 'Bing Moody, W. C. Crenshaw, J. W. Coombe, John Q. Adams, J. R. Kilman and L. B. Wallace were personally liable for an amount equal to one-third of the par value of the capital stock owned by each of them in the bank when it became insolvent; that only those stockholders who signed the contract of guaranty were personally liable, but that the capital stock owned by each of them was liable for one-third of its par value for which a lien was fixed and the stock ordered sold in satisfaction thereof.

Adams agree with the said J. A. Roetzel that, if he will pay into the undivided profits account of said bank the sum of five thousand dollars, said officers and directors for themselves and the stockholders of said bank agree that they will guarantee to said J.

An examination of the contract and of the resolution adopted at the' stockholders ’ meeting discloses the reason and purpose for which the loan <a id="p693" href="#p693" data-label="693" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*693</a>was procured from the intervener. Unless the capital structure of the bank could be strengthened in the sum of $5,000, the bank would be unable to open, and the stockholders were threatened with loss of their investment and an additional assessment on their stock. It was therefore very much to their interest that the requirement of the Bank Commissioner be met. Mr. and Mrs. Roetzel together owned 96 shares out of a total of 600 shares of the capital stock. It Avas therefore as much to their interest as to the other stockholders to keep the bank a going concern. The condition was that the bank’s capital structure should be strengthened to the extent of $5,000, and that certain worthless notes in that aggregate be withdrawn from the assets of the bank. To meet this condition, the $5,000 Avas procured from the intervener. If the bank AATas to OAve Roetzel for this money, its capital structure would not have been strengthened. Hence .it Avas necessary that the bank be not a party to the contract guaranteeing to Roetzel the payment of the money borrowed from him, and this was provided for in express language. Those Avho signed the contract covenanted that they Avere acting for themselves and the stockholders of said bank, “but not for the' bank as an-individual corporate.” As pointed out by counsel for the Bank Commissioner, it will be noted in the resolution ratifying the contract it is recited .that the officials and directors Avere required to strengthen the bank’s capital structure, and that such officers and directors, acting for the stockholders, negotiated the loan. It was the interpretation placed on the contract by the stockholders themselves that it Avas not the obligation of the bank, but of the stockholders, and that it Avas their intention that they were acting in their indiAddual capacities and not for the corporation. This is clear from the unambiguous language of the contract itself, and where. there is no ambiguity it is our duty to enforce the contract to the letter.</p>

The court found that only such of the stockholders as signed the contract were personally liable to the intervener and those the court held were not liable here insist that the contract in so far as it related to the bank was <em>ultra vires </em>and void, and that because of this it could not be ratified by the stockholders. We are of the opinion that our conclusion as to the liability of the bank and what we have said regarding it disposes of this contention. The officers and directors were not acting for the bank, nor did they profess to do so, but for themselves and the other stockholders personally. The contract, in express terms, guarantees the payment to the intervener the $5,000 and professes to act for the parties signing the contract and for the stockholders. These stockholders at their next annual meeting considered a resolution which recited the reasons for the advancement of the money by the intervener, the negotiations of the officers with the intervener for the loan, and that in conducting the same they were acting for the stockholders. With this in mind the resolution was adopted by which, in express terms, they recognized their liability ánd not that of the bank under the contract theretofore entered into between the directors and Roetzel. By this resolution the par value of the shares of stock each stockholder owned was used as a yard stick by which the liability of each would be measured, and such stock was pledged to the extent of such liability. Because of this resolution, we are of the opinion that there was no other or different liability on those acting for the stockholders who signed the contract and those who ratified it. By the. plain terms of the language used they intended to, <a id="p695" href="#p695" data-label="695" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*695</a>and did, bind themselves personally to pay their .just proportion of the $5,000 advanced by Roetzel, which was deemed to be an 'amount equal to one-third of the par value of the capital stock owned by each. It was equally to the interest of J. A. Roetzel and Adeline Roetzel as to the other stockholders that the capital structure of the bank be strengthened. They joined with, the other stockholders in the resolution, and therefore they, too, are liable for their proportionate part, and, with this deducted, the remaining stockholders are obligated for the balance.</p>

A. Roetzel and Adeline Roetzel as stockholders is deducted; and that a lien be fixed on the stock and the stock sold to satisfy the judgment, the intervener being entitled to have execution for any residue of the debt after the stock has been applied to the payment thereof.</p>

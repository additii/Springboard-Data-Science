This would have reduced the assessed value from more than $6 per acre down to $2 per acre.

      <a id="p1173" href="#p1173" data-label="1173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1173</a>Appellant contends that the trial court should have overruled appellee’s demurrer to the first paragraph of the intervention because the State cannot confirm, under act 296 of the Acts of 1929, the title to tax lands acquired by it on void levies and void sales. The answer to this contention or argument is that the State is not attempting to do so. It is only attempting to validate or cure tax sales on account of “informalities and irregularities” in the levy of taxes or sales thereof. This is the extent of the State’s authority under the act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Delinquent </em>Lands, <a href="/ark/182/0648-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="182 Ark. 648" data-case-ids="1389728" data-case-paths="/ark/182/0648-01">182 Ark. 648</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20S.W.2d%201061" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="32 S.W.2d 1061">32 S. W. (2d) 1061</a>. It is true that appellant alleged in paragraph one of the intervention that the levy of taxes and sales were void. This allegation is a mere conclusion of law, and not sufficient on demurrer. Appellant assigns in said paragraph seven reasons for the invalidity of the levies and sales, but all of the reasons assigned are mere informalities and irregularities in making the levies or sales. These are the very defects the State can cure in confirming her tax titles; hence the demurrer to that part of the intervention attacking them was properly sustained. The only right of an improvement district claiming to be the owner of lands to defend against the confirmation of the State’s tax titles on account of informalities and irregularities in the levy and sale thereof is found in § 8 of said act, which is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1193-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1193.4",1193,[148,1719,1205,631]],["BL_1194.1",1194,[286,363,1200,201]]]'>“Any special improvement district claiming that there is owing it overdue taxes on any lands described in the State’s petition shall have a right to be made a party defendant to the State’s suit for the purpose of contesting the sale under which the forfeiture to the State was made. Any such improvement district, upon payment of the amount of taxes, penalty and costs for which the land was forfeited and all past-due taxes which would have accrued had the land remained on the tax books at the valuation against it immediately prior to the forfeiture, shall be subrogated to the State’s lien for the amount so paid, and such improvement district may <a id="p1174" href="#p1174" data-label="1174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1174</a>include such amount due the district for taxes, and shall have the right to foreclose for such amount as though the same had been assessed against such land in favor of the improvement district.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b1194-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1194.4",1194,[285,569,1200,460]]]'>As appellant’s allegations in paragraph one of its intervention failed to comply with § 8 of said act by tendering into court the amount due the State thereunder, the demurrer thereto was properly sustained. The State’s right to levy and collect taxes for the support of government and to make its taxes a first lien on the property in the State cannot be questioned. The State exercised this paramount right in the passage of the following statute in 1879:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1194.5",1194,[286,1034,1199,190]]]'>“Taxes assessed upon real and personal property shall bind the same and be entitled to preference over all judgments, executions, incumbrances or liens whensoever created.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b1194-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1194.6",1194,[286,1248,1199,300]]]'>Act 269 of the Acts of 1929 provides a method by which to inforce this paramount or prior lien of the State for its taxes against the former owners of forfeited lands, including improvement districts, which acquired lands through foreclosure proceedings for the nonpayment of improvement district taxes.</p>
    <p id="b1194-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1194.7",1194,[286,1564,1200,612]]]'>Appellant also contends that the trial court should have overruled appellee’s demurrer to the third paragraph of the intervention on account of an overvaluation of lands for taxation.

The contract it says the act impairs is the lien accorded it by the act creating it for improvement taxes which declared the levee district’s assessments shall be a lien in the nature of a first mortgage. The act creating appellant district, in thus declaring its lien a first mortgage, had reference, of course, to contractual liens and not to the State’s paramount lien for taxes for governmental purposes. This right on the part of the State was a part of the district’s charter, and every contract it has made, as much so as if it had been written therein. Act 296 of the Acts of 1929 is valid, and it is not in conflict with art. 1, § 10, of the Federal Constitution and art. 2, § 17 of the State Constitution.</p>

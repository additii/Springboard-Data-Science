The heirs were necessary parties to the suit, after his death, it being an action affecting the title to and for the recovery of real property, and the revivor should have been made against and in the name of his heirs.

Section 1065, C. &amp; M. Digest. More than two years had expired after the death of the defendant, M. D.

The causes of action, not being severable, so that the appellees might revive and prosecute their suit for rents against the executor of the estate of M. D. Thompson, deceased, no valid judgment could be rendered against such executor, notwithstanding revival of the suit as to him, nor at all, since the necessary parties were not brought before the court, the revivor of the action against the heirs or devisees of the deceased was invalid, and the court was without .jurisdiction to make any adjudication in the case concerning the subject-matter of the suit. <em>Ex parte Gilbert </em>and <em>Dupree </em>v. <em>Smith, supra.</em>

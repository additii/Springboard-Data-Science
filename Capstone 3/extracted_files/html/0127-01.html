(Brusco), alleging wrongful termination in retaliation for opposing Brusco’s discriminatory conduct against another employee. The underlying facts were hotly disputed and centered on Brusco’s response to Long’s having hired as a deckhand Anthony Morgan, an individual who had a prosthetic leg. Morgan was not a party to this lawsuit. As Judge William Downing explained in his order denying Long’s motion for a new trial, “It was repeatedly conveyed to the jury that whether or not, <em>in hindsight, </em>Mr. Morgan was discriminated against was not their concern; rather, their focus should begin with the question of whether or not Mr. Long, <em>at that time, </em>had a reasonable belief that Mr. Morgan was being discriminated against.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 1948.</p>

Courts are appropriately forbidden from receiving information to impeach a verdict based on revealing the details of the jury’s deliberations.

    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.4",187,[201,689,1253,1352]]]'>¶11 We begin by noting that the four juror declarations are not uniform in their description of the facts Long relies on to establish misconduct. For example, two of the declarations omit any reference to the second juror alleged to have introduced “definitive legal premises” into the deliberations. CP at 1783-89. With respect to juror 12, who is mentioned in all the declarations, the characterization of his actual statements varies among the four accounts. All give the impression that juror 12 was persuasive, opining that he “presented his position well,” CP at 1781, that he was “very authoritative about the content of his presentation,” CP at 1784, and that he “persuasively commanded the floor,” CP at 1788. And, they all note that he mentioned he had spent many years in the navy and was familiar with maritime laws, navy rules, boats, and boat safety. CP at 1780-92. But, exactly what juror 12 said about any applicable laws is less clear. For one thing, a second juror, identified in two of the declarations as “Robert P.” or “Bob P.,” reportedly offered his view that coast guard law would not allow a person with a prosthesis to work on the deck of a ship or boat. CP at 1781, 1791. This same juror is described as having “applied his experience in construction” to offer opinions on “sending people home from job sites if they didn’t have their physical or [urinary analysis test] completed.” CP at 1791.</p>

Was it that navy and coast guard rules (or maritime law generally) disallow people with prosthetic limbs from working on ship decks; or instead that juror 12, being familiar with maritime laws <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>generally, was <em>unaware </em>of any law that would have allowed Long to hire Morgan as a deckhand;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> or that it showed bad judgment to hire someone with a prosthesis to work on a deck;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> or something else? Indeed, one declaration states that the “point [juror 12] emphasized the most” was that “[h]e knew from serving on ships that boats are very dangerous, and that someone like Anthony Morgan should not be on a boat by law.” CP at 1788.

[M]y favorite activities are boating on Puget Sound, motorcycling, backpacking, and being a grandfather.”). Neither party exercised a peremptory strike against him. Drawing from his personal experiences, it is unsurprising that juror 12 opined about the legality and safety of allowing someone with a prosthetic leg to work on a ship.

Brusco could have insisted it had the law on its side for not wanting Morgan on its boats and that Long was unreasonable in believing it was discriminating in so doing. But Brusco did not make that argument. For whatever reason, it conceded that element of Long’s case. Perhaps its research suggested what mine did: that Washington law forbids discrimination based on disability and that this civil rights protection is not preempted by federal maritime law. <em>Hoddevik v.

I disagree, however, that the juror’s definitive statements about the content of naval law inheres. Washington common law recognizes two tests for determining what inheres in a verdict. <em>See Gardner v.

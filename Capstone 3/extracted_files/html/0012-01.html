The trial judge sentenced Cobos with the offender score asserted by the State without holding an evidentiary hearing because Cobos’s former counsel had agreed to the score prior to being discharged. The Court of Appeals found the sentencing court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing, remanded for resen-tencing, and concluded that both sides could introduce supplemental evidence of the proper score on remand. <em>State v.

At his sentencing hearing, Cobos moved to represent himself. Before the court ruled on his motion, defense counsel and the State agreed Cobos had an offender score of 9.

Under our common law, on remand for resentencing following the appeal of a sentencing error, the State was permitted to introduce new evidence if the defendant had not made a specific objection at sentencing. <em>State v.

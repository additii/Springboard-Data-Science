To reverse this judgment, they insisted that the trial court had erroneously failed to sustain their plea of former acquittal, it being shown that they had been tried and acquitted for robbing this bank, and that, as both transactions were based upon a single act, an acquittal upon one charge was a bar to a prosecution for the other. We overruled this contention, holding that while an offender may commit the crimes of burglary and robbery in one act he may be separately indicted and prosecuted for each offense, and that an acquittal upon one charge was no bar to a prosecution for the other. Upon this holding the judgment of the circuit court sentencing appellants to a term in the penitentiary for the crime of burglary was affirmed. <em>Whitted </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ark/187/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="187 Ark. 285" data-case-ids="1432073" data-case-paths="/ark/187/0285-01">187 Ark. 285</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20S.W.2d%20283" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="63 S.W.2d 283">63 S.

The contention was and is that, while appellants were properly indicted for robbery, they had never been in-dieted at all for burglary, and in support of this contention certain members of the grand jury were called as witnesses, who testified that only one vote was taken upon the matter of indicting appellants, and this vote was to indict them upon a charge of robbery. It was stipulated that members of the grand jury not then present would testify to the same effect.</p>

    <p id="b31-5" data-blocks='[["BL_31.4",31,[174,492,1203,1487]]]'>The grand jury’s stenographer testified to the same effect. He had taken in short hand the testimony upon which the indictments were returned. The matter was impressed upon his mind by the fact that it was the first case which had come under his observation where a person was indicted for both robbery and burglary as a result of a single act. He drew the indictments, but was uncertain whether to draw an indictment for each offense or to draw a' single indictment with two counts, one charging burglary and the other robbery. He advised with the prosecuting attorney, who directed him to prepare separate indictments, and this he did. The prosecuting attorney corroborated the testimony of the grand jury stenographer. The circuit court clerk testified that two indictments were returned into open court, both signed by the prosecuting attorney and the foreman of the grand jury, in the presence of the entire grand jury, against appellants, one for the crime of robbery and the other for the crime of burglary. Although separate indictments were returned charging appellants with the crimes of burglary and robbery, respectively, it was not necessary that this should be done. The statute provides that certain offenses arising out of the same transaction may be charged in one indictment, and among others are the crimes of robbery and burglary. Section 3016, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest. It was not necessary, therefore, that the grand jury vote a second time to indict appellants for the commission of the crimes of robbery and burglary.</p>

It does not appear when appellants were advised that there was any question about the validity of the indictments upon which they were tried, but it clearly appears that no such question was raised until they had been acquitted on one charge and convicted on the other. The apparent purpose of the statute quoted is to prevent an accused from speculating on the regularity of the proceedings leading up to his indictment. He cannot take the chance of being acquitted and thereafter, being disappointed in this expectation, raise a question which the statute provides shall be raised upon the arraignment or upon the call of the indictment for trial. The indictment must, of course, charge a public offense. Not even a verdict of guilty cures a failure so to do. Section 3224, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest.

W. 497</a>, reflects the fact that the. appellant Nash had been indicted for manslaughter, and the judge of the court referred the charge to the grand jury for further action, and a second indictment was returned, the last being for murder in the first degree. Before being put to trial, the defendant filed a motion to set aside the second indictment, upon the ground, among others, that only eleven members of the grand jury voted for it or concurred in finding it, and' he offered to make proof of this allegation. The court declined to hear testimony sustaining the allegations of the motion to dismiss, and in that connection it was said: ‘ ‘ The statutes of this State require that the proceedings of a grand jury shall be in secret. They provide: ‘Every member of the grand jury must keep secret whatever he himself, or any other grand juror, may have said, or in what manner he, or any other grand juror, may have voted on a matter before them.’ Sand. <em>&amp; </em>H. Digest, § 2054. ‘A grand juror cannot be questioned for anything he may say, or any vote he may give, relative to a matter legally before the grand jury, except for a perjury he may have committed in making accusation, or giving testimony before his fellow jurors.’ Sand. <em>&amp; </em>H. Digest, § 2056. And further provides: ‘Any grand juror who shall disclose any evidence given before the grand jury, except when lawfully required to testify as a witness, * * * shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on .conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not exceeding $100.’ Sand. <em>&amp; </em>H. Digest, § 1752. Thus the statutes protect the proceedings of the grand jury against publicity, and with especial care they prohibit the disclosure of the votes of the individual grand jurors on finding an indictment. It would be a violation of the policy evinced by- these statutes and an invasion of the secrecy of the grand jury room to permit a grand juror to testify as to the number of the grand jurors that voted for an indictment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em><a href="/iowa/39/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="39 Iowa 318" data-case-ids="2305038" data-case-paths="/iowa/39/0318-01">39 Iowa 318</a>; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mewherter, </em><a href="/iowa/46/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="46 Iowa 88" data-case-ids="2333069" data-case-paths="/iowa/46/0088-01">46 Iowa 88</a>; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fasset, </em><a href="/conn/16/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="16 Conn. 457" data-case-ids="12128417" data-case-paths="/conn/16/0457-01">16 Conn. 457</a>; <em>Gitchell </em>v. <em>People, </em><a href="/ill/146/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="146 Ill. 175" data-case-ids="3065581" data-case-paths="/ill/146/0175-01">146 Ill. 175</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20N.E.%20757" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="33 N.E. 757">33 N.

In somewhat different form, but in essentials, the same question was passed upon when the case was first here. There is a conflict in the authorities on this subject. This court adopted the- view that the admission of such evidence contravenes the statutes requiring secrecy of grand jury proceedings, and that the presentment of the indictment by the grand jury in open court is evidence of their concurrence, which can not be overcome by evidence from the members of that body, if at all. The court finds no reason to change that holding.”</p>

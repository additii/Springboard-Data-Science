As a result of the potential merger, Premera would <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>lose PBT membership. Rickman confirmed the merger with Robin Hilleary, director of Premera’s small business group. Rickman informed Hilleary that a Ucentris client asked a Ucentris “[c]aptive agent”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to look for non-Premera insurance in light of the merger. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 187. In response, Hilleary said Premera was putting together a strategy to retain membership and Rickman should advise Ucentris captive agents not to look elsewhere for insurance on behalf of clients. Hilleary told Rickman that Premera planned to use Ucentris captive agents to transfer the memberships of preferred groups from the merged associations into an association underwritten by Premera. <em><a href="/citations/?q=359%20P.3d%20746" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="359 P.3d 746">Id.</a></em>

Before Vidor was retained, Rickman disclosed her relationship with Vidor to her former supervisor, who approved hiring Vidor. According to Rickman, her former supervisor said Rickman did not need to make further disclosures because “ ‘hit’s not an issue. He’s a contractor.’ ” CP at 260. Rickman also disclosed her relationship to a former employee in human resources, but the employee never responded, and human resources has no record of the conversation. Rickman did not otherwise disclose her relationship in her annual conflict questionnaires, to her new supervisor Grover, or to the compliance and ethics department. Rickman testified that many other Premera employees have family members who work for or contract with Premera.</p>

CP at 182-83, 261-62. Vidor received additional compensation as an SME. When another SME stepped down, Vidor assumed <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>his workload and Rickman approved an increase in Vidor’s commission from 5 to 10 percent, twice the amount some other SMEs received.

Ferrara concluded that Rickman’s actions created the appearance of favoritism by condoning familial relationships at Premera and that Rickman did not properly disclose her relationship to compliance and ethics or human resources, especially before approving Vidor’s SME promotion and increasing his commission. Ferrara also concluded Rickman exercised poor judgment and showed a lack of integrity because she was not forthcoming during the investigation. In her 2013 deposition, Ferrara later said she had no knowledge of Rickman’s HIPAA concerns during the investigation or at the time of her recommendation. Grover stated he agreed with Ferrara’s recommendation, and he terminated Rick-man in November 2009.

Premera moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The court found the <em>clarity </em>element of the tort of wrongful discharge was readily established based on HIPAA and Washington’s UHCIA. However, the court ruled that Rickman failed to identify a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the <em>jeopardy </em>and <em>absence of justification </em>elements of her claim. As to the jeopardy element, the court held that Rickman could not establish that other means of promoting the public policy were inadequate because Premera had a robust internal reporting system. Relying on <em>Dicomes v. State, </em><a href="/wash-2d/113/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="113 Wash. 2d 612" data-case-ids="1172044" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/113/0612-01">113 Wn.2d 612</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=782%20P.2d%201002" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="782 P.2d 1002">782 P.2d 1002</a> (1989), the court further held that Rickman acted unreasonably by failing to apprise herself of the details of the risk bucketing plan to determine whether it was in fact illegal, and that public policy was not in jeopardy because Premera did not implement the plan.</p>

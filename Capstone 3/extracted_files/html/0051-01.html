They take from the administrator the right to prefer one to another. To this extent they cure defects in the common law, and provide for the greater security of creditors. The changes made are' commensurate with the evils intended to he remedied. They make no change, however, as to any vested interest that each shall take in the estate. 'Creditors are required to present their claims for the amount due them when it is presented, and to swear ‘ that nothing has been paid or delivered towards the satisfaction of it, except what is credited thereon, and that the sum demanded naming it, is justly due. ’ They may present their claims within one year and 364 days after the grant of the first letters — upon the close of the administration — hut they must make this oath before their demands can he allowed; the statute thereby showing clearly an intention that they shall not share in the assets of the estate, except upon the basis of what is actually due after all payments are deducted. This being the manifest intention of one, it is presumed that it pervades the other statutes upon the same subject, and that when they say, ‘if there be not sufficient to pay the whole of one class, such demands shall be paid in proportion to their amounts,’ according to an apportionment made by the court, they mean by ‘amounts’ the sum actually due <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>at the time of the apportionment.

In <em>Haskill </em>v. <em>Sevier, </em><a href="/ark/25/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="25 Ark. 152" data-case-ids="1864573" data-case-paths="/ark/25/0152-01">25 Ark. 152</a>, the same construction was partially placed upon the statutes of this State. In that case the court directed a foreclosure of a mortgage upon land which was executed by John A. Jordan, deceased, in his lifetime, to secure a debt, and directed that, if the proceeds of the sale were not sufficient to pay the debt, the balance thereafter remaining should be certified to the probate court, and there classed against the estate of Jordan.”</p>

McLean, as a joint maker of the note, she was liable for the principal and the interest, and her property remained as security by virtue of the mortgage. Upon her death, the owner of the mortgage liad the right to pursue one of three remedies as against her: First, she could file her claim for the full amount of the note, with interest, against the estate of the deceased, and thereby recover the full amount of the personal obligation; second, she could file a contingent claim for a possible deficiency on the foreclosure, and then proceed with <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>a foreclosure suit in tlie circuit court for the foreclosure of the mortgage; or third, she could rely solely upon her - security and the foreclosure of her mortgage.” See also 2 Woerner’s American Law of Administration (3d ed.) chapter XLIYa.</p>

That court has no jurisdiction in respect of foreclosure or redemption, and even its judgment allowing the mortgage debt as a claim against the estate is not conclusive upon chancery courts as to the amount of the debt in foreclosure or redemption actions subsequently instituted therein.” Here, however, the probate court is directed to proceed in a matter over which the chancery court first obtained jurisdiction and in which it is still asserting that jurisdiction.</p>

It was there said that the mortgage creditor might go into the probate court and probate his claim against the estate generally, or might foreclose his lien in the chancery court, or that he might pursue both remedies, but there was not involved in that case, as there is here, any question as to the practice in the pursuit of these remedies.</p>

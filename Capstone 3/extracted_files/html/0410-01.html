The complaint was filed April <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>14, 1930, and alleged that the property mortgaged was an undivided one-eighth interest in the land described, which Mahan had inherited from his father, W. Mahan. On the back of the note there appeared the following indorsements: “$80 Sept. 26, 1918. Rec’d of F. L. Wagner eighty dollars. (Signed) Herbert Sprague. April 4, 1920. Rec’d of F. L.

He bought this eighth interest subject to this mortgage, because that mortgage was of record when he purchased, and it was, of course, necessary for him to pay the debt there secured, or cause it to be paid, to clear his title of this outstanding incumbrance.

W. (2d) 985</a>, is in point on this question and is decisive of it. The facts stated in that opinion are as follows : Huggler executed a mortgage to Connelly on March 31, 1922, to secure the payment of notes due in 1923 and 1924. On July 15, 1927, neither of said notes then being barred by the statute of limitations, Huggler executed a mortgage on the same property to Wilson, but made no mention of the prior mortgage to Connelly. The mortgage to Wilson was assigned to Hoffman, who brought suit to foreclose it on February 28, <em>1930, </em>making Connelly and Huggler parties. Hoffman alleged that Connelly’s mortgage was barred by the five-year statute of limitations. Connelly filed an answer and cross-complaint, in which he alleged that Huggler had agreed in writing to pay his debt, this agreement being within the period of limitations, and he prayed a foreclosure of his mortgage from Huggler. An answer was filed by Huggler, who denied the promise to pay and pleaded the statute of limitations against Connelly’s demand. The court granted the prayer of Hoffman’s complaint and dismissed Connelly’s cross-complaint as being without equity. The question of the priority of mortgages as between Connelly and Hoffman was presented on the appeal from that decree.</p>
    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[334,2152,1202,198]]]'>The opinion states the fact to be that Connelly’s mortgage was prior in point of time and was a valid subsisting lien when Hoffman’s mortgage was executed. Both mortgages had been promptly recorded.</p>

The court found the fact to be that there was an agreement on the part of Huggler for an extension of his mortgage lien to Connelly, but that no indorsement thereof was made on the record until after the bar of the statute had fallen. The court held that because of this fact the mortgage from Huggler to Connelly became, in effect, an unrecorded mortgage, and that it made no difference whatever that this mortgage was not barred when Hoffman took his mortgage from Huggler.</p>
    <p id="b437-3" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[157,1086,1205,1017]]]'>It was contended by Connelly in that case that, as Hoffman and Wilson had at least constructive notice of his mortgage, and, having taken their mortgage at a time when his own was a valid and subsisting lien and after the mortgagor Huggler had acknowledged the debt in writing and had agreed to its extension, his mortgage continued thereafter to be a valid lien and paramount to the lien of the Hoffman mortgage. We held to the contrary, for the reason that Hoffman was a third party within the meaning* of the law, and, being* such, his mortgage was superior to that of Connelly, because of Connelly’s failure to indorse the extension agreement upon the margin of the record as required by § 7382, Crawford &amp; Moses’ Digest, which section required the extension agreement to be attested and dated by the clerk. . The extension agreement made by Huggler operated to extend the lien of his mortgage as between himself and Connelly, but did not have that effect so far as Hoffman was concerned, for the reason that Hoffman was a third party, as the statute had not been complied with.</p>

It was alleged that the Commissioner of the court had erroneously recited, in the report of the sale made by him to the <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>court, that, pursuant to this decree, he had sold to the road improvement district a tract of land described as part fractional northeast quarter of section 2, township 3 south, range 4 west, whereas, the land sold was fractional northeast quarter of section 2, township 3 south, range 4 west. The report of sale was confirmed. The certificate of sale, issued by the commissioner of the court to the improvement district, was assigned for the amount of the taxes, etc., for which the land sold, to the plaintiff, who received from the commissioner of the court a deed erroneously describing the land as part fractional northeast quarter of section 2, etc.</p>

In other words, a subdivision, according to the public survey, which is described as fractional is accurately and sufficiently described where it is made fractional from the fact alone that it contains either more or less, usually less, land than such subdivision ordinarily contains. In such cases, the designation “fractional” describes all the land in that subdivision. <em>Graysonia-Nashville Lbr.

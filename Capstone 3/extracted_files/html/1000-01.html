He was living with his second wife at the time of his death, and no children had been born to either of his marriages. His second wife was a widow when he married her, and she later died without issue born to her.</p>

'By the second paragraph he devised to his wife all his real estate, “to be hers, used and possessed by her, to enjoy the rents and profits therefrom during her entire natural life.” Paragraph 3 of the will reads, in part, as follows: “It is my will that at my death my said wife, Mollie Kirk, is to make a division of my personal estate, consisting of stock, moneys, notes and ac-counts, choses in action and bank stock and personal property of every kind, and that she is to have as her share of said personal property a one-third interest in the whole of my personal estate.” This paragraph directed that $500 be paid to the testator’s brother, R. Kirk, “to reward him for taking care of my father and mother during their declining years and last sickness and death, and the remainder of the two-thirds of my personal estate to be divided equally among my brothers and sisters or their descendants, then living, namely, as follows: * * The brothers and sisters were there named, along <a id="p1002" href="#p1002" data-label="1002" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1002</a>with the six children of a deceased brother, who were given their father’s interest. .</p>
    <p id="b1020-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1020.4",1020,[302,498,1208,863]]]'>Paragraph 4 of the will reads as follows: “It is my will and desire that at my death my wife dispose of the personal estate as above set out, and retain only such of the personal property as is necessary for her in the operation of my farm, and that it is my desire that none of my land be sold or divided until the death of my wife, Mollie Kirk, and at her death, and after the payment of her just and legal debts and burial expenses, and the erection of a monument to each of our graves, it is my desire that my real estate and any personal property that remains undisposed of by my wife during her natural life be then divided equally among my brothers and sisters, and their descendants. The descendants of any one of my brothers and sisters to share only in the part that my deceased brother or sister would share in my estate.

Letters testamentary issued, as was directed in the will, and the executrix caused an inventory to be made and the property to be appraised. The entire estate was appraised at $10,980.47, of w^iich sum $1,680 represented the value of the land. The testator had made contracts to convey certain portions of the real estate, and, by appropriate orders, these contracts were performed, and the unpaid purchase money collected. The personal property consisted principally of money in bank and the capital stock of the bank, in which the money was deposited, and certain notes and accounts. Most of this property was converted into money under orders of the probate court, and the executrix reported to the court that she had $9,000 on hand to be distributed as directed by the will. In her petition for an order of distribution the executrix reported the taxes and other disbursements which had been made. She alleged that she was entitled to one-third of the money under the will and to commissions of &lt;$320 as executrix, making an aggregate amount <a id="p1003" href="#p1003" data-label="1003" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1003</a>to which, she was entitled of $3,320. After allowing $500 to he paid E. Kirk, a balance of $4,972.99 was reported on hand for distribution among the surviving brothers and sisters and the six children of the deceased brother, the share of each being calculated and stated.</p>
    <p id="b1021-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1021.4",1021,[178,636,1205,498]]]'>An order of distribution was made pursuant to the prayer of the petition, and this money appears to have been paid over to the devisees who were entitled thereto. Mrs. Kirk, the executrix, deposited her part to her individual credit in the bank with which her husband had been connected, and at the time of her death, which occurred in June, 1932, she had on deposit $1,400 in a checking account and $1,600 in the form of a time deposit. It was stipulated that all the money on deposit had been derived from the estate of the testator.</p>

    <p id="b1021-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1021.6",1021,[181,1352,1201,394]]]'>Certain claims were probated against the estates of both Mr. and Mrs. Kirk, which need not be considered, as there is no controversy about them. Kirk’s estate was solvent, and the deWs were small, and the will had directed the payment, not only of the testator’s debts, but those of his wife’s also, including her burial expenses and the cost of erecting a monument to each of their graves.</p>

This petition alleged that under § 1, Crawford <em>&amp; </em>Moses’ Digest, an administration upon Mrs. Kirk’s estate was unnecessary. A response was filed by Bird, as administrator, putting the <a id="p1004" href="#p1004" data-label="1004" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1004</a>allegations of the petition in issue. A consent order was entered by the probate court of Scott County directing Bird, as administrator, to pay over to Mrs. Mason the $1,400 demand deposit to the credit of Mrs. Kirk at the time of her death, and all other questions were reserved.</p>

    <p id="b1022-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1022.5",1022,[307,985,1203,557]]]'>It is insisted for the reversal of this judgment that the circuit court erroneously construed the provisions of the will, hereinabove recited, and, in support of this contention, we are cited to the case of <em>King </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em><a href="/citations/?q=146%20Ark.%20447" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="146 Ark. 447">146 Ark. 447</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=225%20S.W.%20656" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="225 S.W. 656">225 S.

We are cited also to numerous cases announcing rules for the construction of wills containing conflicting provisions.</p>

It is true, of course, that, having made no election to disregard the will, the widow is presumed to have elected to take the provisions made for her by the will, although it may now appear that she would have profited by renouncing the will.

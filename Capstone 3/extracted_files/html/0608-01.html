Section 3 of 1-1366 proposes a constitutional amendment requiring a supermajority vote or voter approval to raise all taxes and legislative approval to increase any fees.

The same cannot be said of 1-1366. Sponsors point to no history that the legislature has treated sales tax reductions and constitutional amendments or supermajority requirements together. And unlike funds to assist law enforcement in policing liquor sales in the newly privatized marketplace, a reduction in the current sales tax rate is not necessary to implement a constitutional amendment or a change to the method for approving all future taxes and fees; quite the opposite, in fact, since one subject actually voids implementation of the other subject.</p>

The contingencies in <em>Storey </em>and <em>Brower </em>differ significantly from the claimed contingency here. The first difference is that 1-1366 depends on inaction, not an operative set of facts outside the legislation itself. The State frames the contingency as the happening of a future event, but this is not so. Rather than making the sales tax reduction contingent on a future event, 1-1366 starts with the sales tax reduction that will go into effect on April 15. Section 3, the constitutional amendment provision, is not an event that triggers the reduction, but an escape hatch through which to avoid it. In contrast, the contingencies in <em>Storey </em>and <em>Brower </em>were designed to avoid the enactment of unnecessary legislation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Here, we find no nexus between a constitutional amendment—even one that deals with future taxes and fees—and a reduction to the current sales tax rate. Although we have not previously discussed the need for a nexus between the operative set of facts and the law it sets in motion, it is a matter of common sense.

Here, 1-1366 contains two unrelated operative provisions but only one will go into effect. The fact that the initiative does not enact both provisions does not save it from violating article II, section 19. It is still impossible to determine how many people voted for one provision and how many for the other. In one sense, an initiative so structured warrants the protections of article II, section 19 even more than bills flawed by traditional logrolling because many voters will not even receive the benefit of at least having the provision they did vote for go into effect.</p>

    <p id="b685-5" data-blocks='[["BL_685.5",685,[202,1203,1247,751]]]'>¶47 The most direct, simple, and clear way to resolve this case is to recognize that Initiative 1366 sets article XXIII on its head. The initiative ignores the constitutionally required first step—the proposal of a constitutional amendment in either house. Wash. Const, art. XXIII, § 1. The initiative then skips the constitutionally required second step—a super-majority vote in each house approving the amendment— and jumps directly to something like the third—ratification of the voters before any vote in the legislature. Only then does it jump back to the constitutionally mandated second step—a two thirds vote of each house to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot. Clerk’s Papers at 25 (Initiative 1366, § 3). Initiatives are not the proper vehicle to amend the constitution. Initiative 1366 is unconstitutional.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">8</a>

      <p id="b685-6" data-blocks='[["BL_685.6",685,[201,2042,1248,335]]]'> I have an additional concern about this initiative. In effect, it is an attempt, through a statewide vote, to limit the power and responsibility of an individual legislator, elected by his or her own district, to propose and act on proposed legislation and constitutional amendments. <em>See </em>Utter &amp; Spitzer, <em>supra, </em>at 63 (citing <em>Maynard v. Valentine, </em><a href="/wash-terr/2/0003-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="2 Wash. Terr. 3" data-case-ids="1826013" data-case-paths="/wash-terr/2/0003-01">2 Wash.

Legislators have a constitutionally cognizable interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes. <em>League of Educ. Voters, </em>176 Wn.2d at 817 (quoting <em>Coleman v.

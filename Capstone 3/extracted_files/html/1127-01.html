There were three paragraphs to the complaint, one for killing a horse, one for killing a cow, and one for killing two hogs. The complaint shows that the stock was killed on different days, and each paragraph constituted á distinct and separate cause of action. In <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Linton, </em><a href="/ark/1/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Ark. 252" data-case-ids="8728572" data-case-paths="/ark/1/0252-01">1 Ark. 252</a>, it was held that the- amount of each separate demand or cause of action, and not the aggregate of various causes which may be joined in one action, determines the jurisdictional amount.

Inasmuch as the aggregate of the items is more than $100, and the cause of action is one in fort, the mayor’s court had no jurisdiction, and the circuit court acquired none on appeal. <em>St. L. S.

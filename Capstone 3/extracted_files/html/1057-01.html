C. Childers, county judge of Lawrence County, and other persons, asking the Commission to regulate and fix the tolls to be charged on a certain toll bridge spanning Black River, on State Highways Nos. 63, 67 and 25, at Powhatan, Lawrence County, Arkansas, on the grounds that the schedule of rates fixed in the franchise under which the bridge was constructed is excessive and discriminatory, and that the county court of Lawrence County had no .jurisdiction to fix the schedule of rates at the time it attempted to do so, as the Railroad Commission had sole jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and still has, under act 571 of the Acts of 1919 (General Acts 1919, page 411) and act 124 of the Acts of 1921 (Acts 1921, page 177),' respectively. Attached to the complaint as an exhibit thereto was the order of the county court granting the franchise to erect the bridge and to collect tolls thereon, the various items of which were specified. There was a provision in the franchise whereby the named tolls might be increased, if they were unremunerative, or, on the other hand, might be reduced if they were excessive.</p>

The Railroad Commission excepted to this order, and was granted an appeal to this court. The matter is now before us on a writ of certiorari which issued out of this court.</p>

A demurrer to this complaint was overruled, and the court made perpetual a temporary restraining order issued at the commencement of the action. In the opinion on the appeal it was said that: “The main question in the case is whether or not the power to fix ferry tolls is vested in the county court by the Constitution, or in the Railroad Commission by the recent statute creating that Commission.

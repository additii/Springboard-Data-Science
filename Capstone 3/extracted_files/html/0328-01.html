    <p id="b349-4" data-blocks='[["BL_349.7",349,[184,812,1202,663]]]'>The purpose of the petition and its effect, if granted, was to take from School District No. 10 a strip of territory, varying in width from one-fourth to one-half mile and extending across the entire west side of the district, and annex same to Emerson School District No. 66. Within this territory was located a tank farm with an assessed valuation of $57,380, the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company’s transmission lines with an assessed valuation of $872, the Louisiana &amp; Northwest Railroad with an assessed valuation of $16,500, the Arkansas Transit Company with an assessed valuation of $860, “or property, exclusive of the value of the territory proposed to be detached, of the total valuation of $75,74-2.”</p>

School District No. 10 was present with its entire board of directors, and its attorney on May 15th, had notice of the action of the board of education, but took no appeal from the order changing the boundaries.</p>

    <p id="b350-3" data-blocks='[["BL_350.4",350,[274,719,1199,1271]]]'>Decision of the question necessitates a construction of §§ 44 and 52 of act 169 of 1931, which appear to be in conflict about the procedure required. Under the terms of said § 44 the board is given the same authority for a change of boundary lines of school districts, the formation of new districts, the dissolution of existing districts, the transposition of territory of old districts, and the law requires that it can exercise such authority on the consent of the majority of electors in each school district affected as shown by petition or elections as herein provided, and also provides the method for holding the elections or presenting the petitions, the giving of notice, etc. Section 52 appears to provide for an adjustment or change of boundary line or lines between adjoining districts upon application' made by the directors of any district after 10 days’ notice of a call for a joint meeting of the directors of the districts affected with the county board of education, and that the chairman of the board may make the order changing the boundary line or lines between the districts upon approval of a majority of the members of the school boards of the districts-, and, if they are not able to agree to the proposed change of boundary lines, the county board-may either change or fix the boundary line or deny the relief asked and let the boundaries remain unchanged.</p>

Under either of these statutes the consent of a majority of the electors, as shown by the petition filed with the- board, was necessary to give it jurisdiction to change the boundary line between the school districts. <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>School Dist., </em><a href="/ark/104/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="104 Ark. 145" data-case-ids="1350585" data-case-paths="/ark/104/0145-01">104 Ark. 145</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=148%20S.W.%20504" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="148 S.W. 504">148 S.

Having no such jurisdiction, the board’s order was void, and could be quashed on certiorari, and the court erred in not granting the desired relief. The judgment is reversed accordingly, and the cause will be remanded to the circuit court with directions to grant the petition for certiorari and quash the order of the county board of education changing the boundary line of the districts petitioned for. It is so ordered.</p>

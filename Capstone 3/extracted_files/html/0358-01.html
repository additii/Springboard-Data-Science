Her claim focuses on the quality of treatment that she received postsurgery, which she alleges fell below the applicable standard of care. Generally in a medical malpractice claim, a plaintiff needs testimony from a medical expert to establish two required elements—standard of care and causation. RCW 7.70.040; <em>Grove v. PeaceHealth St. Joseph Hosp., </em><a href="/wash-2d/182/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="182 Wash. 2d 136" data-case-ids="4075760" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/182/0136-01">182 Wn.2d 136</a>, 144, <a href="/citations/?q=341%20P.3d%20261" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="341 P.3d 261">341 P.3d 261</a> (2014).</p>
    <p id="b403-7" data-blocks='[["BL_403.11",403,[202,1336,1252,575]]]'>¶2 The Doctors moved for summary judgment, arguing she lacked a qualified medical expert who could provide testimony to establish her claim. In response to the motion, her counsel filed two timely affidavits and one untimely affidavit from her medical expert. The trial court granted a motion to strike the untimely affidavit. Considering the remaining affidavits, the court ruled that the expert did not connect his opinions to specific facts to support the contention that the Doctors’ treatment fell below the standard of care. Therefore, the court granted summary judgment for the Doctors.</p>
    <p id="b403-8" data-blocks='[["BL_403.12",403,[201,1944,1247,367]]]'>¶3 The Court of Appeals reversed. Although it agreed that the two timely affidavits lacked sufficient factual support to defeat summary judgment, it held, under de novo review, that the trial court should have denied the motion to strike and should have considered the third affidavit. This affidavit, the court held, contained sufficient factual support to defeat summary judgment.</p>

On January 24,2008, Dr. Chad surgically removed loose plates and screws left in place from the surgery, cleaned out infected parts of the jawbone, and wired Keck’s jaw shut. Keck went to the emergency room three days later, experiencing facial swelling. On March 18, Dr. Chad performed another surgery to clean the infected jawbone and install “more stout hardware” because her jaw had not yet formed healthy bone, a condition called “nonunion.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 136. At a follow-up visit on June 11, Keck had loose bone and hardware that moved with finger manipulation. On July 18, Dr. Chad surgically grafted bone and installed new hardware.

On March 22, plaintiffs filed a second affidavit of Dr. Li that referred to both doctors. In all other respects, the second affidavit remained unchanged from the first.

The proposed standard would allow a qualified expert to only state that “the defendant breached the standard of care and caused the plaintiff’s injuries,’’ without providing more, to defeat summary judgment. However, to survive summary judgment in any case, there must be a question of material fact. We reject Keck’s invitation to adopt a less stringent summary judgment standard for experts. We also reject the Doctors’ suggestion for a more stringent standard. They challenge the factual foundation of Dr. Li’s opinions, even though he stated that he relied on various medical records to reach his conclusions. CP at 47 (para. 3). ER 705 would allow an expert’s testimony without prior disclosure of the underlying facts, unless the trial court required disclosure. As long as the expert’s affidavit testimony, if believed, could sustain a verdict, the trial court should give the plaintiff an opportunity to supply more detail if the court determines more detail would be desirable. <em>See Bulthuis v.

Instead, the plaintiff untimely submitted an expert declaration, the defendant moved to strike it on the grounds of untimeliness, and the trial court granted the motion. It is highly questionable whether that is in fact a discovery sanction.</p>

I recognize our case law is split on this, but I conclude that whether to accept an untimely filed affidavit is the sort of case management decision best left in the trial court’s hands. <em>See Pitzer v.

In 2011, Gentry filed a motion in Kitsap County Superior Court, seeking postcon-viction DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) testing, which the trial court granted. Among the items to be tested was a blood<a id="p752" href="#p752" data-label="752" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*752</a>stained shoelace that had been introduced into evidence at trial.</p>
    <p id="b806-4" data-blocks='[["BL_806.4",806,[185,454,1253,696]]]'>¶2 After the DNA report on the shoelace came back matching the victim’s blood profile, the State moved to end further DNA testing. By that time, the judge who granted the original motion had retired, and the case was assigned to Judge Jennifer Forbes. Gentry sent a letter to Judge Forbes indicating she may have a potential conflict of interest. During the motion hearing, Gentry asked Judge Forbes to recuse herself, observing that she had worked in the prosecutor’s office during the time of Gentry’s collateral appeals and that her husband had worked for the local police department during the investigation of the crime. Judge Forbes declined to recuse herself, also denying a subsequent written motion for recusal.</p>
    <p id="b806-5" data-blocks='[["BL_806.5",806,[186,1167,1249,588]]]'>¶3 Judge Forbes granted the State’s motion to deny further DNA testing, ruling that Gentry could not meet the substantive standard of RCW 10.73.170, which requires a convicted person to show the likelihood that DNA evidence would demonstrate innocence on a more probable than not basis. She concluded that the statute does not impose a presumption that further DNA testing will be favorable and exculpatory and held that even with such a presumption, Gentry could not show probable innocence in light of the new inculpatory DNA test on the shoelace. Gentry timely appealed directly to this court.</p>

Gentry failed to preserve his argument that the trial judge should have treated his recusal request as an affidavit of prejudice. There is no reversible error in the trial judge’s refusal to recuse herself. And, while the judge’s conclusion that RCW 10.73.170 does not impose a favorable presumption of exculpatory DNA test results is clearly wrong in light of our recent decision in <em>State v.

We hold that Judge Forbes acted within her discretion in determining that Gentry could not demonstrate probable innocence in light of the result of the DNA test on the shoelace, even assuming the remaining DNA evidence would be favorable to him.</p>

The Negroid hair was later determined to be genetically consistent with the Defendant’s brother’s arm hair. Defendant’s brother was not in Kitsap County at the time of the murder. Evidence was produced to show that the Defendant, who lived with his brother’s family, wore his brother’s clothes on occasion.

    <p id="b809-7" data-blocks='[["BL_809.6",809,[105,711,1255,870]]]'>¶6 On February 3, 2011, Gentry filed a motion for postconviction DNA testing. Gentry argued that DNA testing has advanced since the time of his trial and now allows for more accurate testing as well as testing of items that were previously difficult or impossible to test. Gentry requested (1) comparative DNA testing of hairs found on Holden’s body, T-shirt, and thigh with members of Holden’s and Gentry’s families and other African-Americans and (2) testing of the blood found on Gentry’s shoes and shoelaces. Gentry argued that if the DNA of one of the hairs belonged to someone other than himself or to an individual with no legitimate reason to be in close contact with Holden, there may exist a new basis to doubt his guilt. And if the DNA of the untested blood belonged to someone other than Holden, questions may exist about the evidence on which the prosecution relied.</p>
    <p id="b809-8" data-blocks='[["BL_809.7",809,[103,1605,1251,375]]]'>¶7 The State did not object to Gentry’s motion but reserved the right to later object to the relevance and admissibility of the results. On July 25, 2011, the court granted the motion. The court ordered about 58 items to be subject to DNA testing pursuant to RCW 10.73.170 (DNA testing requests) by the Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory (crime lab).</p>
    <p id="b809-9" data-blocks='[["BL_809.8",809,[100,2004,1251,373]],["BL_810.1",810,[184,335,1248,324]]]'>¶8 On September 7, 2011, the crime lab sent the court a preliminary letter indicating its ability to perform the testing. The crime lab said it had the capacity to perform the DNA testing but indicated that the items most likely to yield probative DNA test results are those that had been previously examined during the original trial. It therefore recommended obtaining the DNA extracts held by Forensic <a id="p756" href="#p756" data-label="756" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*756</a>Science Associates, run by Edward Blake. Blake declined to provide Gentry the DNA extracts for testing because he argued it was his work product. According to Gentry, the prosecutor never attempted to obtain the DNA extracts for testing despite Blake’s indication that he would return them upon request by the prosecutor.</p>
    <p id="b810-4" data-blocks='[["BL_810.4",810,[185,677,1248,425]]]'>¶9 On May 18, 2012, the court granted Gentry’s motion to release the left shoelace to a defense expert to conduct microscopic examinations. The expert issued a report raising concerns about the handling of the shoelaces during their initial testing and concluding that the characteristics of the bloodstains “lack the necessary features for concluding that they were the result of blood spatter.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 573.</p>
    <p id="b810-5" data-blocks='[["BL_810.5",810,[186,1119,1248,418]]]'>¶10 On July 16, 2013, the crime lab completed DNA testing of the shoelace and submitted a copy of its results to the court. The crime lab found that the DNA profile obtained from the bloodstains on the shoelace matched the DNA profile of Holden. It reported that “[t]he estimated probability of selecting an unrelated individual at random from the U.S. population with a matching profile is 1 in 110 trillion.” CP at 520.</p>

Thus, the State said, the “odds are 1 in 110 <em>trillion </em>that the blood on Gentry’s shoe was Cassie Holden’s. There is now no possibility that the State has convicted the wrong man.” CP at 507.

The trial court alternatively held that “even if the Court were to apply the standard rejected in Conclusion [of Law VI], in light of the results of the testing of the shoelace, Gentry would still be unable to meet the ‘onerous’ substantive standard of Subsection (3).” <a id="p766" href="#p766" data-label="766" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*766</a>CP at 676-77 (Conclusion of Law VII). Thus, the court’s decision ultimately rests on the correct legal standard.</p>
    <p id="b820-4" data-blocks='[["BL_820.4",820,[186,460,1249,1018]]]'>¶36 The key question, then, concerns whether it is proper for a trial court to consider “newly discovered” postconviction DNA evidence alongside the trial evidence and the presumably favorable untested DNA evidence. The statute is silent on this issue, and our cases to date have not presented this situation. In past cases, we have been faced only with circumstances where a court considers probable innocence in light of the trial evidence and presumably favorable untested DNA evidence. <em>See Riofta, </em>166 Wn.2d at 358; <em>State v. Thompson, </em><a href="/wash-2d/173/0865-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="173 Wash. 2d 865" data-case-ids="4020451" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/173/0865-01">173 Wn.2d 865</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=271%20P.3d%20204" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="271 P.3d 204">271 P.3d 204</a> (2012); <em>Crumpton, </em>181 Wn.2d at 265. While <em>Riofta </em>said that courts must view “all of the evidence presented <em>at trial </em>or <em>newly discovered, favorable DNA test </em>results,” 166 Wn.2d at 367 (emphasis added), it did not involve the issue here: whether a court can or should consider new DNA test results as they come in when determining whether to allow further testing. Or must a court ignore any new results and consider only the evidence admitted during trial and presumably favorable DNA test results?</p>
    <p id="b820-5" data-blocks='[["BL_820.5",820,[187,1496,1249,641]]]'>¶37 Gentry argues that allowing consideration of new DNA evidence before all the testing is completed results in de novo review of a granted order under RCW 10.73.170. Gentry says such a rule would defeat the purpose of RCW 10.73.170 by making DNA testing orders subject to constant reconsideration and revision. However, Gentry does not cite any authority for the proposition that a court cannot modify a previous order when new evidence is discovered and a party moves for relief. Further, RCW 10.73.170 contains no language prohibiting a trial court from modifying an order granting postconviction DNA testing.</p>
    <p id="b820-6" data-blocks='[["BL_820.6",820,[187,2154,1247,213]],["BL_821.1",821,[106,340,1251,97]]]'>¶38 We interpret RCW 10.73.170 in a way that balances the interests of fairness and finality. DNA testing of multiple items will almost always result in evidence coming in piece by piece, and it does not seem unreasonable to test the <a id="p767" href="#p767" data-label="767" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*767</a>most significant items first to see whether further testing is necessary.</p>
    <p id="b821-4" data-blocks='[["BL_821.4",821,[105,458,1256,526]]]'>¶39 We conclude that trial judges do have the discretion to consider all relevant evidence in deciding a question under RCW 10.73.170. Such a rule is fair to both parties and supports finality. We find nothing in the statutory scheme that prohibits a trial court from cutting off further testing once it has new evidence that makes it impossible for a convicted person to meet the statutory burden of showing “the likelihood that the DNA evidence would demonstrate innocence on a more probable than not basis.” RCW 10.73.170(3).</p>
    <p id="b821-5" data-blocks='[["BL_821.5",821,[105,1010,1250,423]]]'>¶40 The issue remains as to whether Judge Forbes abused her discretion in concluding that even with a favorable presumption as to the yet untested DNA evidence, Gentry cannot show a reasonable probability that he is innocent. This inquiry requires considering the evidence at trial, the results of the new DNA test from the left shoelace, and the favorable presumption that the remaining DNA testing would exculpate Gentry.</p>
    <p id="b821-6" data-blocks='[["BL_821.6",821,[102,1454,1257,690]]]'>¶41 The evidence at trial establishing Gentry’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt included DNA testing of blood found on the shoelaces seized from Gentry’s home, which did not eliminate the victim, Cassie Holden, as the source of the blood. Our decision upholding Gentry’s conviction noted that the bloodstained shoes and laces were a key piece of inculpatory evidence. <em>See Gentry, </em>125 Wn.2d at 580-81, 604. The recent DNA test of the left shoelace confirmed the presence of the victim’s blood to a high degree of certainty. CP at 520. Remaining evidence to be tested includes bloodstains on Gentry’s shoes and hairs found on Holden’s body. <em>See </em>CP at 487-91 (listing the items that are subject to DNA testing).</p>

Even assuming the further testing shows the hairs did not belong to Gentry, evidence at trial showed that many sources could have <a id="p768" href="#p768" data-label="768" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*768</a>deposited the hairs. VRP (No. 58415-0) (May 17, 1991) at 209 (testimony that on the day of the murder, at least one African-American child was playing at the victim’s home); 208 (testimony that on the day of the murder, the victim spoke with a young girl who was being supervised by an African-American babysitter); VRP (No. 58415-0) (May 15, 1991) at 3820, 2826 (testimony that the victim’s brother sometimes played with three African-American friends). However, the presence of another person’s hair on Holden’s body does not mean that Gentry is innocent. <em>See Riofta, </em>166 Wn.2d at 370-71 (noting that the presence of another person’s DNA evidence on a hat found at the crime scene is not evidence that someone other than the defendant committed the crime).</p>
    <p id="b822-4" data-blocks='[["BL_822.4",822,[181,1117,1258,954]]]'>¶43 Further testing of the blood found on the shoes presents a closer question, however. Assuming such testing is favorable to Gentry requires assuming the results do not identify Cassie Holden as the source of the blood. Thus, the court would have blood evidence on the left shoelace that matches Holden’s DNA profile to a high degree of certainty alongside blood evidence on the shoes that does not match. The question is whether this evidence, considered in conjunction with the trial evidence and the further “evidence” that the DNA hair test results do not match Gentry’s DNA profile, demonstrates Gentry’s innocence on a more probable than not basis. More precisely, the question is whether the trial court abused its discretion in concluding it does not. While reasonable judges could disagree and some might allow further testing of at least the remaining blood evidence, Judge Forbes’s decision falls within the range of acceptable decisions and was not an abuse of discretion under ROW 10.73.170.</p>

Gentry’s request that Judge Forbes recuse herself was not an affidavit of prejudice, and the judge did not abuse her discretion in declining to recuse. The trial judge also acted within her discretion in granting the State’s motion to deny further DNA testing. Though the court recited an incorrect legal standard, the order also rested on application of the correct standard and the sustainable conclusion that further DNA testing would not demonstrate Gentry’s innocence on a more probable than not basis.</p>

The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court. The basis for the prosecution centers on E.J.J. calling the officers abusive names, yelling, and using profanity toward the officers while they were engaged in a criminal investigation. We find insufficient evidence to support the conviction, and that E.J.J.’s words <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>directed at the officers are constitutionally protected.

(a juvenile at the time). The police responded and began their intervention by escorting R.J. out of the house 10 to 15 feet away from the front door, where the officers attempted to calm her down. E.J.J. grew concerned when he saw an officer reach for what he perceived to be a nightstick.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> E.J.J. exited the house and stood on the porch, telling the officers that R.J. was his sister and that they should not use the nightstick. The officers advised him that they were in the middle of their investigation and instructed him multiple times to leave the scene and return to the house. Initially, E.J.J. did not comply, questioning why he had to return to the house. When, eventually, he did return to his home, he stood in the open doorway and continued his verbal interaction with the officers. The house had two doors: a wrought iron screen door, through which someone could see out and communicate, and a second, solid wood door. The officers directed E.J.J. multiple times to close the solid wood door and to withdraw farther into the home, but E.J.J. refused, stating that he wanted to supervise the scene from the doorway (10 to 15 feet away from the other officers and R.J.) to make sure that R.J. was not harmed. E.J.J. continued to stand behind the closed wrought iron door. Multiple times, an officer reached into the home to close the solid door. E.J.J. would immediately reopen it. At this point, E.J.J. was irate, yelling profanities and calling the officers <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>abusive names.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> An officer warned E.J.J. that he could be arrested for obstruction. After E.J.J. continued to reopen the solid door, an officer put him under arrest for obstruction of a law enforcement officer. The entire interaction lasted approximately 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that the record supported the trial court’s determination that E.J.J. was guilty of obstruction.

More precisely, it appears that the Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that E.J.J. obstructed police when he became irate, hurled abuses on the officers, and refused to close the solid wood <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>door to his home. But this exchange is so intertwined with E.J.J.’s protected speech that we find insufficient evidence of E.J.J.’s conduct to support his conviction on this basis. The trial judge said as much when commenting, “If [E.J.J.] had simply stood there . . . and observed the situation and if the officers had said close the door and he had disobeyed that order, [they] might not be here today and there could very well not be sufficient evidence of obstruction.” Report of Proceedings (RP) at 99. This recognition by the trial court is telling because it implies that the trial judge based the conviction on E.J.J.’s refusal to close the door and his abusive statements toward police, and not on E.J.J.’s approach toward the police officers. Most importantly, because we cannot be confident that his words did not support the trial court’s conclusion that the front door exchange constituted obstruction (quite the opposite, E.J.J.’s speech appears to be dispositive), we find insufficient evidence of conduct from the exchange between E.J.J. and police at the front door.</p>

That E.J.J.’s behavior may have caused a minor delay is of no import. Although the officer’s request that E.J.J. return to his home and close both doors might have been an attempt for a more <em>convenient </em>resolution of the situation, “[s]tates cannot consistently [sic] with <em>our </em>Constitution abridge those freedoms to obviate slight inconveniences or annoyances.” <em>Giboney, </em>336 U.S. at 501-02.

The word “taunting” came up. I don’t know whether that accurately describes what went on here, but it’s very clear to the court that by raising his voice and calling the officers names, he was making his presence known to his sister, and the testimony was that through his presence, it made it more difficult for the officers to do their job.</blockquote>

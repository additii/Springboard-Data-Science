It was also alleged that all of the occupants of the car were made unconscious as a result of the accident, and that appellant’s car was traveling at such an excessive speed, and turned over with such force, that it was practically destroyed.

Appellant quotes from that case as follows: “It is the duty of the guest to exercise ordinary care for his or her safety; and a failure to exercise such care, which contributes to the injury or might have resulted in avoiding* the danger and resultant injury, will constitute contributory negligence.” The court, however, also said: “It was also an issue for the jury as to whether the appellant was guilty of contributory negligence. The court erred in not submitting these issues to the jury.”</p>

    <p id="Ac4" data-blocks='[["BL_801.6",801,[201,906,1200,504]]]'>Appellant calls attention to many authorities in support of his contention that it is the duty of an invited guest to exercise ordinary care to protect himself from injury, to caution the driver of the danger, protest against it, and to do what a reasonable, prudent person would do under the circumstances for his own safety. If he fails to exercise such care, and his failure contributes in any degree to produce the injury, he cannot recover. This court has many times announced this doctrine, and it is supported by the great weight of authority.</p>
    <p id="b801-7" data-blocks='[["BL_801.7",801,[204,1419,1198,293]]]'>In determining the question of contributory negligence, it is proper to consider all the circumstances and evidence in the case, the condition of the road, appellees ’ knowledge of the ability and fitness of the driver, the speed of the car, the character and cause of the accident, and all the circumstances in the case.</p>
    <p id="b801-8" data-blocks='[["BL_801.8",801,[201,1733,1204,410]]]'>Mr. Conrey testified that the car had turned over two or three times, and, after it turned over the last time, had skidded for some distance. The car was almost demolished. The wrecked car had apparently “sides wiped” the truck; had run up on the pavement and turned over about 120 feet beyond the truck. The car was badly wrecked, and witness testified that he had to practically rebuild it.</p>

Snotzmeier testified that he told the driver he was going too fast, and the driver told him not to worry, that he would watch out. Snotzmeier then testified that he dozed off to sleep, and the next thing he knew he was <a id="p782" href="#p782" data-label="782" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*782</a>in the hospital. Snotzmeier was riding in the front seat with the driver.</p>
    <p id="b802-3" data-blocks='[["BL_802.4",802,[292,491,1200,240]]]'>. Hoover testified that the car was being driven at a high rate of speed, ahont 60 miles an honr.

It will he seen from the evidence that the road was a concrete surface, straight, and the accident occurred about four o’clock in the morning, when there was very little travel. Snotzmeier testified that he cautioned the driver, and the driver said that he would be careful, and watch out. The question therefore of contributory negligence of appellees was for the jury..</p>
    <p id="b802-5" data-blocks='[["BL_802.6",802,[285,1148,1202,351]]]'>“Unless the facts are manifest, and the inference to be drawn therefrom clear beyond peradventure, the question whether the guest of an automobile driver, having no control over him, was negligent in failing to appreciate the danger in crossing railroad tracks, or to act in relation thereto, must be submitted to the jury.” 2 Blashfield on Automobiles, 1133.</p>
    <p id="b802-6" data-blocks='[["BL_802.7",802,[283,1506,1201,652]]]'>So here the question of whether the guests were negligent was a question for the jury. Negligence is never presumed, but must be proved, and when Snotzmeier cautioned the driver, and when the driver said he would watch out an&lt;f be careful, the guests had a right to assume that he would do this. They had a right to take into consideration the character of the road, the time of the morning, their knowledge of the driver’s ability; and, considering all these facts and circumstances, it was a question of fact whether the appellees acted at the time as men of ordinary prudence would have acted under the circumstances, and, if they did, they were not guilty of negligence.</p>

If several guests are riding in a ear, it would be unnecessary for all of them to <a id="p783" href="#p783" data-label="783" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*783</a>caution tlie driver, if any,one of them cautioned him, and the others heard it. In other words, guests in an automo.-bile are required to exercise just such care as a person of ordinary prudence would exercise under the circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b803-5" data-blocks='[["BL_803.5",803,[211,640,1202,557]]]'>“The question whether a guest or passenger in a motor vehicle exercised due care for his own safety is usually a question for the jury under all the evidence, as whether an automobile driver and his guests were negligent in attempting to cross before defendant’s approaching motor truck, 75 or 100 feet away, or where plaintiff failed to act as a person of ordinary prudence would have acted under the circumstances, or, as the rule is sometimes expressed, he is bound to look out for his own safety as far as practical.” 2 Blashfield on Automobiles, 109.</p>

There is surprisingly little authoritative discussion in decisions or text books as to the relation of sleep to the doctrines of negligence, although in a number of cases it seems to have been assumed that it constitutes contributory negligence for one in a position of peril to become incapacitated by sleep from protecting himself from harm. * # * In any ordinary case one cannot go to sleep while driving an automobile without having relaxed the vigilance which the law requires without having been negligent. It lies within his own control to keep awake or cease from driving, and so the mere fact of his going to sleep while driving is a proper basis for an inference of negligence sufficient to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case, and sufficient for a recovery, <a id="p784" href="#p784" data-label="784" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*784</a>if no circumstances tending to excuse or justify bis conduct are proved. If snob circumstances are claimed to bave been proved, it then becomes a question of fact whether or not the driver was negligent; and in determining that issue all the relevant circumstances are to be considered, including the fact that ordinarily sleep does not come upon one without warning of its approach. The trial court was right in leaving the issue to the jury as one of fact.” <em>Bushnell </em>v. <em>Bushnell, </em><a href="/conn/103/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="103 Conn. 583" data-case-ids="1648020" data-case-paths="/conn/103/0583-01">103 Conn. 583</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.%20432" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="131 A. 432">131 Atl. 432</a>. <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.L.R.%20785" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="44 A.L.R. 785">44 A.

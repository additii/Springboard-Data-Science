Taylor, State Bank Commissioner, recovered a default judgment against appellant, H. B. Case, in the Stone County Chancery Court in a sum in excess of $8,000. The indebtedness was secured by a pledge of $10,000 in common and $5,000 in preferred stocks of the Batesville White Lime Company. This stock was directed to be sold by John F. Crammer, Special Deputy Bank Commissioner in <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>charge of the North Arkansas Bank, insolvent, at public sale in Batesville, Arkansas, after'having advertised said sale for ten days by at least one insertion in a weekly paper in Stone County and in Independence County, and by giving the defendant written notice of said sale, etc. The sale was effected, and a report thereof made by the Special Commissioner, whereupon appellant interposed the following exceptions thereto:</p>
    <blockquote id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[283,756,1194,97]]]'>“First, that the sale can only be made by the circuit clerk, as ex-officio commissioner.</blockquote>
